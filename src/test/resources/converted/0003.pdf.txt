her, as we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is 
 no problem at all. 
 In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
 explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
 comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
 talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
 anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are 
 able to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
 approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
 were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
 victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
 topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
 always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
 In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
 that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
 the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
 discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
 and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
 particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
 you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could 
 facilitate that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure 
 you that every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive 
 experience more generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how 
 we have been able to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely 
 would take the same sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who 
 have spoken with us. 
 Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how 
 our process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that 
 with no obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could 
 just address the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue 
 to appreciate your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
 thank you very much,

 Defendants Indyke and Kahn, filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands 
 for The Trust on August 26, 2019. 
 17. Epstein maintained a deliberately complex web of Virgin Islands corporations, 
 limited liability companies, foundations, and other entities, not all of which are yet known to the 
 Government of the Virgin Islands, through which he carried out and concealed his criminal 
 conduct. 
 18. Epstein regularly created new entities in the territory and transferred properties and 
 funds between them in order to preserve and shield Epstein's assets and to facilitate and conceal 
 the unlawful acts described in this Complaint. 
 19. These entities held properties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at 
 which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned and 
 arranged for private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from, and 
 within the Virgin Islands, and provided money to pay these young women and underage girls. 
 20. Epstein sat at the hub of this web, serving as president, member, manager, or 
 director of each of the entities and, upon information and belief, directing their activities. 
 21. Defendant, Nautilus, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
 of the Virgin Islands. It was incorporated on November 22, 20 I I . 
 22. According to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns 
 Little St. James, a/k/a Parcel Number 109803010100, a parcel of 3.1 million square feet valued at 
 $3.2 million, with buildings and improvements valued at $4 million.

 Page 5 of 55 
 23. Epstein was president and director of Nautilus, Inc., which corporate filings 
 describe as "holding property for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are the secretary and 
 treasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values Epstein's holdings of Nautilus, Inc., 
 which holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million. 
 24. A deed recorded with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds on December 30, 2011 
 reflects that the property was transferred from a Delaware entity, L.S.J., LLC, to Nautilus, Inc. for 
 "TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration." The quitclaim deed lists 
 Jeffrey Epstein as the sole member of L.S.J., LLC, which it acquired Little Saint James via a 
 warranty deed dated April 27, 1998. 
 25. As described below, Epstein engaged in a pattern and practice of trafficking and 
 sexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. 
 James where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin 
 Islands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from 
 leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 
 26. Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated in carrying out, facilitating and concealing 
 Epstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
 27. Defendant, Great St. Jim, LLC, is a limited liability company established and 
 organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was organized on October 26, 
 2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, owns at 
 least three properties that make up Great St. James acquired on January 28, 2016: Parcel Number 
 109801010100, consisting of 3.5 million square feet and valued at $17.5 million; Parcel Number 
 109801010200, consisting of 450,000 square feet of land, valued at $2.8 million; and Parcel 
 Number 109801010300, 1.2 million square feet of land, valued at $2.7 million. According to a

 Page 6 of 55 
 warranty deed filed with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Epstein, through Great St. Jim, 
 LLC, acquired the last two parcels for $5 million each. 
 28. Epstein is listed as manager and a member of Great St. Jim, LLC and the nature of 
 its business is described as "holding assets." 
 29. Upon information and belief, Epstein purchased these Great St. James properties—
 the island with closest proximity to Little St. James—to further shield his conduct on Little St. 
 James from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the public, and allow him to 
 continue and conceal his criminal enterprise. Epstein's significant investment in the purchase of 
 Great St. James demonstrates his intent to expand his illegal operation in the Virgin Islands for 
 years to come. Thus. Great St. Jim, LLC participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and 
 continuing Epstein's crimes, and Great St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
 30. Defendant, Poplar, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
 of the Virgin Islands. Poplar, Inc. was incorporated on November 22, 2011. Epstein was president 
 and director of Poplar, Inc., and its purpose was described in corporate filings as "holding property 
 for personal use.- Defendants Indyke and Kahn are secretary and treasurer of Poplar, Inc., 
 respectively. 
 31. A certificate of incumbency provided to the Department of Planning and Natural 
 Resources ("DPNR") also lists Epstein as president of Poplar, Inc. and expressly authorizes the 
 incorporators to conduct "transactions related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great 
 St. Jim, LLC." 
 32. Poplar, Inc. is listed as the signatory for the 2017 Annual Report for Great St. Jim, 
 LLC, and the signature appears to be Epstein's. The Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary 
 EFTA00018784

 GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 7 of 55 
 filed by The Estate lists Poplar, Inc. as holding title to Great St. James. Thus, Poplar, Inc. 
 participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes. 
 33. Defendant, Plan D, LLC is a limited liability company established and organized 
 under the laws of the Virgin Islands. In its original Articles of Organization, filed October 19, 
 2012, and Annual Report filings, Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski. was listed as Plan D, LLC's sole 
 manager/member. However, the July 31, 2019 Annual Report revealed Epstein as the principal 
 behind Plan D, LLC. 
 34. Upon information and belief, Plan D, LLC owns one or more of the airplanes and 
 helicopters that Epstein used to transport young women and children to and from the Virgin Islands 
 to carry out the criminal pattern of activity described below. Among the airplanes owned by Plan 
 D, LLC is a Gulfstream with N-number N212JE. Flight logs and travel notices indicate that 
 Epstein used this plane to traffic and transport and young women and underage girls to the Virgin 
 Islands. 
 35. Defendant, Hyperion Air, LLC is a limited liability company established and 
 organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands on October 19, 2012. Jeffrey Epstein is a 
 manager/member of Hyperion Air, LLC, along with his pilot, Larry Visoski. The purpose of 
 Hyperion Air, LLC is listed in its Annual Report as -holding assets.' 
 36. Hyperion Air, LLC is the registered owner of a Bell helicopter with N-number 
 N331JE and a Keystone helicopter with N-number N722JE. Upon information and belief, Epstein 
 used these helicopters to transport young women and underage girls between St. Thomas and Little 
 St. James. 
 37. Defendant Southern Trust Company, Inc. was originally incorporated in the Virgin 
 Islands on November 18, 2011 as Financial Informatics, Inc., but changed its name to Southern

 Trust Company in September 2012. Southern Trust Company is a tenant at American Yacht 
 Harbor in Red Hook, St. Thomas, and Epstein is a "passive investor" in IGY-AYH, d/b/a American 
 Yacht Harbor. By the end of 2013, according to its corporate filings, Southern Trust Company 
 has assets of $198.5 million; four years later, its assets reached $391.3 million. From 2011 until 
 at least 2018, Jeffrey Epstein was the President/Director of Southern Trust Company, and 
 Defendants Kahn and Indyke were Treasurer/Director and Secretary/Director, respectively. 
 Epstein was the sole owner of Southern Trust Company. 
 38. John and Jane Does represent individuals and entities whose identities or 
 involvement with Epstein are currently unknown. The Government of the Virgin Islands will 
 amend the Complaint to add these individuals and entities when discovered. 
 39. The Attorney General brings this action to seek all remedies available to the 
 Government of the Virgin Islands in enforcing its laws and protecting the public interest and public 
 safety. These claims are distinct from, and are not intended to supplant, the claims of victims who 
 were unconscionably harmed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. 
 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
 A. The Conduct of the "Epstein Enterprise" in the Virgin Islands 
 40. Epstein and his associates, including Defendants, identified and recruited female 
 victims, including children, and transported them to the Virgin Islands where they were abused 
 and injured. Epstein, through and in association with Defendants, trafficked, raped, sexually 
 assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women at his properties in the Virgin Islands. 
 41. Epstein created a network of companies and individuals who participated in and 
 conspired with him in a pattern of criminal activity related to the sex trafficking, forced labor, 
 sexual assault, child abuse, and sexual servitude of these young women and children. Epstein and 
 EFTA00018786
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 10 of 55 
 GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 9 of 55 
 his associates trafficked underage girls to the Virgin Islands, held them captive, and sexually 
 abused them, causing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury. 
 42. To accomplish his illegal ends, Epstein formed an association in fact with multiple 
 Defendants and others (both companies and individuals) who were willing to participate in, 
 facilitate, and conceal Epstein's criminal activity in exchange for Epstein's bestowal of financial 
 and other benefits, including sexual services and forced labor from victims. 
 43. This illicit association of Epstein, Defendants, and his associates constitute what is 
 referred to herein as the "Epstein Enterprise." Epstein's associates in the Epstein Enterprise, 
 including, but not limited to, those named as Defendants knowingly facilitated, participated in, and 
 concealed Epstein's illegal conduct. 
 44. Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise which engaged 
 in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands by repeatedly procuring and subjecting 
 underage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and forced labor. 
 45. The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin 
 Islands (and elsewhere) with the criminal purpose and goal of placing a steady supply of vulnerable 
 female children and young women into sexual servitude in service of Epstein's desires, and those 
 of his associates. The Epstein Enterprise maintained and made available young women and 
 underage girls for the purpose of engaging them in forced labor and sexual activities and used 
 coercion and deception to procure, abuse, and harbor its victims. 
 46. Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019 the Epstein 
 Enterprise transported underage girls and young women to the Virgin Islands, who were then taken 
 via helicopter or private vessel to Little St. James where they were then deceptively subjected to

 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 10 of 55 
 sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and 
 forced labor. 
 47. In furtherance of its criminal activities, the Epstein Enterprise used its aircraft to 
 transport the young women and underage girls to the Virgin Islands for purposes of sexual abuse 
 and exploitation. 
 48. The Epstein Enterprise facilitated and participated in the sexual molestation and 
 exploitation of numerous girls between the age of 12 and 17 years old. 
 49. On the pretext of providing modeling opportunities, careers and contracts, 
 associates of the Epstein Enterprise, funded by the Epstein Enterprise, lured and recruited young 
 women and underage girls to travel to locations including the Virgin Islands where, upon 
 information and belief, based on the pattern and practice of the Epstein Enterprise, they were 
 sexually abused and exploited. 
 50. Associates in the Epstein Enterprise recruited both victims and abusers into the 
 Epstein Enterprise, participated in sexual acts of rape and abuse of minors and witnessed Epstein 
 and others engage in sexual acts with children. 
 51. As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing 
 Epstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age of 11 and 
 18 years. 
 52. Upon information and belief, based on Epstein's pattern of trafficking and sexually 
 abusing young girls, the Epstein Enterprise trafficked and abused these girls, and others, in the 
 Virgin Islands through 2018. 
 53. When sued in civil court for committing sex trafficking and sex crimes, Epstein 
 never denied engaging in sexual acts with underage females and procuring underage females for

 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 11 of 55 
 prostitution, but instead consistently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
 incrimination. 
 54. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise kept a computerized list of 
 underage girls who were in or proximate to the Virgin Islands, and able to be transported to 
 Epstein's residence at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. 
 55. The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct by trafficking 
 children and young women and placing them in sexual servitude and forced labor in the Virgin 
 Islands. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 133 to 138, which prohibit 
 trafficking and sexual abuse. The Epstein Enterprise also repeatedly violated laws against child 
 abuse and neglect, including 14 V.I.C. § 505, which defines the crime of child abuse as knowingly 
 or recklessly causing "a child to suffer physical, mental, or emotional injury," or causing a child 
 to be placed in a situation where such injury is foreseeable, and 14 V.I.C. § 506, which applies, as 
 here, where the child suffers serious physical, mental, or emotional injury as a result of that abuse. 
 The harm to Epstein's victims was both fully foreseeable and deeply damaging. 
 56. The Epstein Enterprise knowingly recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, 
 received, procured, obtained, isolated, maintained, and enticed young women and girls to engage 
 in forced labor (such as providing massages) and, ultimately, sexual servitude at his little St. James 
 residence. 
 57. A 15 year old victim was forced into sexual acts with Epstein and others and then 
 attempted to escape by swimming off the Little St. James island. Epstein and others organized a 
 search party that located her and kept her captive by, among other things, confiscating her passport. 
 58. Another victim, who was first engaged in provide massages to Epstein, was then 
 forced to perform sexual acts at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. When she attempted to

 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 12 of 55 
 escape from the "private island," Epstein and a search party found her, returned her to his house. 
 and suggested physical restraint or hann if she failed to cooperate. 
 59. The Epstein Enterprise deceptively lured underage girls and women into its sex 
 trafficking ring with money and promises of employment, career opportunities and school 
 assistance. The Epstein Enterprise preyed on their financial and other vulnerabilities, and 
 promised victims money, shelter, gifts, employment, tuition and other items of value. For 
 example, participants in the Epstein Enterprise targeted young and underage females under the 
 pretext that they would be paid substantially merely to provide massages to him and others. 
 However, once drawn in, victims were then pressured and coerced to engage in sexual acts. 
 60. The Epstein Enterprise forced underage victims to recruit others to perform services 
 and engage in sexual acts—a trafficking pyramid scheme. 
 61. The Epstein Enterprise paid girls for each "meeting." with additional money if they 
 brought additional girls. Epstein reportedly required three meetings per day. 
 62. The Epstein Enterprise used the term -work" as a code for sexual abuse, and, upon 
 information and belief, reportedly kept computer records of the contact information for the victims. 
 63. Consistent with his creation and use of a complex web of entities to carry out and 
 conceal the criminal trafficking enterprise in the Virgin islands, the Epstein Enterprise sometimes 
 paid young women and underage girls he exploited and trafficked through his charitable 
 foundations. 
 64. Once the girls and women were recruited, participants in the Epstein Enterprise 
 enforced their sexual servitude of victims by coercion, including but not limited to, confiscating 
 passports, controlling and extinguishing external communications, and threatening violence. They

 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 13 of 55 
 also made fraudulent statements to family members of victims, claiming victims were being well 
 cared for and supported financially in college and other educational opportunities. 
 65. The Epstein Enterprise transported, held, sexually abused, trafficked, and 
 concealed women and children at his property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times over nearly 
 two decades. 
 B. The "Epstein Enterprise" Abused Privileges of Residency to Carry out its 
 Criminal Scheme 
 66. The Epstein Enterprise in 1998 acquired Little St. James in the Virgin Islands as 
 the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual 
 servitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St. James is a secluded, private island, nearly two 
 miles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or helicopter; 
 no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the island, and no 
 bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the 
 private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and 
 children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permission and 
 assistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. 
 67. In 2016, upon information and belief, using a straw purchaser to hide Epstein's 
 identity, the Epstein Enterprise acquired Great St. James the nearest island to Little St. James. By 
 then, Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise 
 purchased the island for more than $20 million because its participants wanted to ensure that the 
 island did not become a base from which others could view their activities or visitors. By acquiring 
 ownership and control of Great St. James to the exclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created 
 EFTA00018791
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 15 of 55 
 GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 14 of 55 
 additional barriers to prevent those held involuntarily on Little St. James from escaping or 
 obtaining help from others. 
 68. Great St. James and Little St. James are environmentally sensitive locations, with 
 native coral and wildlife protected by federal and territorial law and enforcement authorities. The 
 Department of Planning and Natural Resources ("DPNR") regulates and monitors construction in 
 the Coastal Zone to protect, maintain and manage the precious natural resources of the Virgin 
 Islands. Under its authority, DPNR repeatedly issued citations and assessed thousands of dollars 
 of fines for violations of the Virgin Islands construction code and environmental protection laws 
 on both Little St. James and Great St. James—significant penalties to the agency and to the average 
 resident of the Virgin Islands. But because of Epstein's enormous wealth, these fines had little 
 effect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's unlawful conduct or conforming its activities 
 to the law. 
 69. As a result of illegal construction activity of the Epstein Enterprise, the Virgin 
 Islands has incurred, and will incur, significant expenses to remove the illegal construction or 
 remediate its effects on natural resources in and around Little St. James and Great St. James. The 
 extent of the potential environmental damage is unknown at this time as the illegal construction 
 has not been removed or remediated. 
 70. The Epstein Enterprise continues to attempt to prevent or limit DPNR authorities 
 from conducting random inspections on the Little St. James and Great St. James necessary to 
 comply with Virgin Islands law. 
 71. The Epstein Enterprise's violation of the construction and environmental laws was 
 part of a pattern of behavior in flouting the laws of the Virgin Islands and holding itself above the 
 law. Upon information and belief, as described above, the Epstein Enterprise undertook

 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 15 of 55 
 construction at Great St. James after 2016 to continue the scheme to carry out and conceal his 
 trafficking and sexual abuse of young women and children in the Virgin Islands. These actions 
 are also indicative of the Epstein Enterprise's disregard for Virgin Islands' law. The Epstein 
 Enterprise used the Virgin Islands' land, resources, people, and laws for its illicit purposes. Rather 
 than participating lawfully in this community, the Epstein Enterprise took advantage of the 
 secluded nature of the islands in furtherance of its crimes. 
 72. As a result of its deplorable and unlawful conduct, the Epstein Enterprise has 
 subjected the Virgin Islands to public portrayals as a hiding place for human trafficking and sex 
 crimes. 
 C. The "Epstein Enterprise" Fraudulently Concealed its Conduct 
 73. The Epstein Enterprise fraudulently concealed its actions to prevent detection by 
 the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
 74. The secluded properties at Little St. James and Great St. James were repeatedly 
 used by the Epstein Enterprise as the locations for unlawfully soliciting, transporting, transferring, 
 harboring, receiving, providing, isolating, patronizing, maintaining, deceiving, coercing, and 
 sexually abusing young women and children and concealing these crimes. 
 75. The Epstein Enterprise was able to hide the trafficking ring from law enforcement, 
 despite the fact that Epstein was a registered sex offender. Given the isolation of the Little St. 
 James and Great St. James and the nature of the crimes and of the victims targeted by the Epstein 
 Enterprise, the activities of the Epstein Enterprise were not readily detectable. Moreover, Epstein's 
 great wealth and power likely made witnesses reluctant to report their observations to the local law 
 enforcement. 
 EFTA00018793
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 17 of 55 
 GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 16 of 55 
 76. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise prevented its employees from 
 cooperating with law enforcement. Employees and others were required to sign confidentiality 
 agreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing information with law enforcement. If 
 they were contacted by law enforcement they were to notify the Epstein Enterprise and be 
 represented by Epstein's counsel. 
 77. The employees were directed not to communicate or interact with guests visiting 
 Little St. James and were also directed not to disclose to anyone events that occurred on the island. 
 78. Monitoring a sex offender with his own private islands and the resources to fly 
 victims in and out on private planes and helicopters presented unique challenges and allowed the 
 Epstein Enterprise to limit scrutiny by the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
 79. Sexual Offender Registration and Community Protection Act ("SORCPA") 14 
 V.I.C. § 1721, et seq. requires sex offenders to register in their resident jurisdictions and to make 
 periodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information. 
 80. Epstein renewed his registration each year in the Virgin Islands. In addition, 
 beyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited—or attempted to visit—
 Little St. James to conduct additional address verifications. 
 81. At his last verification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands 
 Department of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, to enter Little St. James 
 beyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his "front door." Instead, Epstein arranged to be met 
 at his office on St. Thomas. 
 82. Epstein also misled the Government regarding his travel plans. On March 19, 2019, 
 the Virgin Islands was notified that Epstein would be traveling to France for 10 days on the private 
 plane owned by Plan D, LLC. His notification form did not disclose travel to any other countries. 
 EFTA00018794
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 18 of 55 
 GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
 GVI's First Amended Complaint 
 Page 17 of 55 
 It was later found by law enforcement authorities that Epstein also travelled to Vienna and Monaco 
 during that trip. 
 83. Similarly, the Epstein Enterprise sought to prevent DPNR from conducting routine 
 site visits to inspect unpermitted and potentially damaging construction activity on Great St. James. 
 The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly objected to DPNR's inspections referring to them as "invasions-
 of Epstein's constitutional right to privacy in his home, which he described defined as the entire 
 island. These DPNR inspections are required for all construction and Virgin Islands residents are 
 required to cooperate with the inspections to assure compliance with the law throughout the 
 construction phases. 
 84. These efforts represent Epstein Enterprise's intent to conceal its unlawful activity 
 on Little St. James and Great St. James. 
 85. The Epstein Enterprise also created numerous corporations and limited liability 
 companies in the Virgin Islands to help conceal its unlawful activity. Most of these companies 
 were created in 2011 and 2012, soon after Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands. 
 86. Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski is identified as member or co-member in companies 
 that serviced and maintained the planes that the Epstein Enterprise used to traffick young women 
 and children — Freedom Air Petroleum, LLC (registered November 28, 2011 to hold assets); and 
 JEGE, LLC (registered October 19, 2012 to hold assets). 
 87. Other Epstein entities include LSJ Employees, LLC (registered October 27, 2011 
 to provide services); Southern Financial, LLC (registered February 25, 2013 to provide services) 
 and LSJ Emergency, LLC (registered December 2, 2015 to provide services). 
 88. Some of these companies held considerable assets: Financial Informatics, Inc. 
 (incorporated November 18, 2011, also known as Southern Trust Company, Inc.) had assets of

 approximately $391 million in 2015; and Financial Trust Company, Inc. (incorporated November 
 6, 1998) had assets of $212 million when it publicly filed its last balance sheet in 2012. 
 89. Though often absent in the original incorporation or registration documents or 
 annual filings, Epstein ultimately appeared as president, director, manager, or sole member of each 
 of these companies. Upon information and belief, the purpose of this complex array of corporate 
 entities —some of which may still be discovered—was to allow Epstein to shelter his assets in 
 order to fund, carry out, and conceal his identity and pattern of criminal conduct. 
 90. The Estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the 
 criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise. On November 24, 2019, Epstein's Estate filed an 
 Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program in the Superior 
 Court of the Virgin Islands. (-Motion"). According to the Motion, the proposed program was to 
 be designed to -"establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program for purposes of 
 resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein." (Motion, at 1). 
 91. The program proposed by the Estate, whose executors are trustees of The 1953 
 Trust and officers in at least two Epstein entities, imposes confidentiality requirements and 
 requires any claimant accepting an award under the program to sacrifice any other claims against 
 "any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. Epstein's conduct." (Motion, at 5). It acts to 
 conceal the criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise and shield its participants from liability 
 and accountability for the injury they caused to the victims. 
 92. Two days before his death, Epstein amended The Trust and his Last Will and 
 Testament. Upon information and belief, he did so, as part of a pattern and ongoing effort to 
 conceal and shield his assets from potential recovery by claimants.

 D. The "Epstein Enterprise" Violated Numerous Virgin Islands Laws 
 93. The pattern of criminal activity engaged in by Epstein and other participants in the 
 Epstein Enterprise violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 605 and 607 of the Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
 Organizations Act ("CICO"). 
 94. The Epstein Enterprise also violated Title 14, Chapter 3A, The Virgin Islands 
 Uniform Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act relating to Trafficking of 
 Persons; Title 14, Chapter 24, relating to Child Protection and Child Abuse and Neglect; Title 14, 
 Chapter 81, relating to Prostitution and Related Offenses; Title IS, Chapter 85, relating to Rape 
 and Sexual Assault and other related offenses, as well as other Virgin Islands laws. 
 95. The Epstein Enterprise violated Virgin Islands laws by engaging in the human 
 trafficking of underage girls and young women and commercial sex with young women and 
 underage girls by force, fraud, enticement, or coercion, which serve as predicates to the Epstein 
 Enterprise's violations of CICO. 
 96. Certain participants who recruited women and underage girls to be trafficked and 
 forced into sexual servitude themselves were sexually trafficked and abused by the Epstein 
 Enterprise and may be afforded the protections of 14 V.I.C. § 145. 
 97. Specifically, Plan D, LLC knowingly and intentionally facilitated the trafficking 
 scheme by flying underage girls and young women into the Virgin Islands to be delivered into 
 sexual servitude. Plan D LLC repeatedly made flights from the mainland to St. Thomas with 
 Epstein and underage girls and young women for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity on 
 Little St. James. On some occasions, they would transport Epstein and female children by

 Page 20 of 55 
 helicopter to Little St. James. On other occasions, Epstein and the young women and girls would 
 be transported by boat. 
 98. Great St. Jim, LLC and Nautilus, Inc. knowingly participated in the Epstein 
 Enterprise and facilitated the trafficking and sexual servitude of young women and underage girls 
 by providing the secluded properties at, from, or to which Epstein and his associates were able to 
 transport, transfer, receive, maintain, isolate, harbor, provide, entice, deceive, coerce, and sexually 
 abuse underage girls and young women. 
 99. The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a continuing course of unlawful conduct. 
 100. After Epstein's suicide, the Epstein Enterprise continued to exist as each of the 
 participants continued to conspire to prevent detection of the breadth and scope of the Epstein 
 Enterprise's criminal wrongdoing and to prevent accountability. These conspiratorial acts are 
 ongoing. 
 101. The conduct of the Epstein Enterprise offends the core purpose of the Virgin Islands 
 Uniform Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act, 14 V.I.C. §131 et seq, and 
 violates CICO, enacted to "curtail criminal activity and lessen its economic and political power in 
 the Territory of the Virgin Islands by establishing new penal prohibitions and providing to law 
 enforcement and the victims of criminal activity new civil sanctions and remedies." 14 V.I.C. § 
 601. 
 102. The Epstein Enterprise is an illicit enterprise within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. §§ 
 604 and 605. 
 103. The Government is entitled to recover civil penalties, damages and other remedies 
 and to extinguish and recoup from the Epstein Enterprise any and all financial and other benefits, 
 and any personal and real property that was used during the course of, or intended for use in the 
 EFTA00018798

 course of the conduct or criminal activity in violation of the laws of the Virgin Islands. The 
 Government is entitled to obtain through divestiture, forfeiture, or other equitable relief all 
 properties and instrumentalities used by the Epstein Enterprise in the criminal pattern of trafficking 
 and sexual abuse in the Virgin Islands, including but not limited to Great St. James and Little St. 
 James, and all other remedies and penalties permitted by law in the interest of justice. 
 E. The Epstein Enterprise Used Corporate Entities to Defraud the Government and 
 Fund its Criminal Activities 
 104. In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company applied for economic benefits from 
 the Economic Development Commission ("EDC"). The EDC is a subsidiary of the Virgin Islands 
 Economic Development Authority ("EDA"), a semi-autonomous governmental instrumentality 
 created and governed pursuant to 29 VIC § 1101. 
 105. In sworn testimony at a public hearing on the tax incentive application conducted 
 by the EDC on November 15, 2012, Epstein and his attorney, Ericka Kellerhals, described 
 Southern Trust Company as providing "cutting edge consulting services" in the area of 
 "biomedical and financial informatics.-
 106. The EDC granted Southem Trust Company a 10-year package of economic 
 incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% exemption 
 from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and withholding taxes in the 
 Virgin Islands. 
 107. Between 2013 and 2019, Southern Trust Company employed 13 different 
 individuals (not including Epstein). Of those 13 individuals, II served in administrative or support 
 roles: six as personal, administrative, or executive assistants, receptionists, or as a driver/helper, 
 one as an office manager, one as a clerk, and three in accounting or payroll functions (though only

 Page 22 of 55 
 one was licensed as a certified public accountant). There was one network administrator/IT 
 manager, and a second who was added in 2019. 
 108. In fact, several of those individuals seemed to perform other personal services for 
 Jeffrey Epstein. Though he was reported by Southern Trust Company to be resident of the Virgin 
 Islands, the network administrator/IT manager was issued a Florida driver's license, which listed 
 an address in Miami. Further, he appears, in fact, to have served as Epstein's driver and picked up 
 luggage and cargo from Epstein's private planes on his behalf 
 109. Another executive assistant lived at 301 E. 66th Street, Apartment 11B, New York, 
 New York. Epstein's address book lists units various units in this building as providing "Apt. for 
 models" and she is publicly identified as a model. As noted above, the Epstein Enterprise used 
 modeling opportunities and contracts as a pretext for recruiting underage girls and young women 
 into its sex trafficking scheme. 
 110. During several time periods, Southern Trust Company affirmed to EDC that it had 
 no employees who were non-residents, even though it employed non-residents. 
 III. Despite having only one full-time employee working on information technology 
 during the bulk of the period, Southern Trust Company reportedly generated net income of $50.3 
 million in 2013, $67.5 million in 2014, $52.8 million in 2015, and $4.8 million in 2016 and $17.1 
 million in 2017, with aggregate income of $117.8 million in 2014, $170.6 million in 2015, $175.3 
 million in 2016 and $192.4 million in 2017, or aggregate income for the period of $656 million. 
 112. For the period between January I, 2013 and December 31, 2017, Southern Trust 
 Company received tax exemptions totaling $73.6 million. 
 113. As of December 31, 2017, Southern Trust Company, Inc. elected to file its income 
 tax as an S-corporation, which elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credits

 Page 23 of 55 
 through to its sole shareholder—Jeffrey Epstein—for tax purposes. For this time period, Epstein's 
 income tax exemption was $71.3 million. 
 114. Based upon these facts, it is clear that Southern Trust Company did not perform the 
 "informatics" business represented to the EDC and could not have generated the business income 
 attributable to that business. Instead, upon information and belief, Southern Trust Company 
 existed to secure tax benefits for Epstein, to employ individuals associated with the Epstein 
 Enterprise, and to provide a source of income to support his criminal activities and properties in 
 the Virgin Islands.

 Notice of Allegation of 
 PUNITIVE DAMAGES 
 307. The purpose of punitive damages in the common law is to punish the defendant 
 for outrageous conduct that is reckless or intentional and to deter others from engaging in such 
 conduct in the future. 
 308. This Complaint describes intentional conduct so egregious, persistent, and injurious 
 that it shocks the conscience and offends a civilized society. 
 309. Punitive damages are especially important in the case of persons or companies that 
 have so money, assets, and power that mere fines, penalties, and economic damages are simply 
 not sufficient. 
 310. At all times material herein, Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise engaged repeatedly 
 in wrongful acts which were intentional and outrageous. The Government gives notice that it 
 intends to pursue the possibility of punitive damages in any jury verdict. 
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
 WHEREFORE, the Government respectfully requests that the Court: 
 A. Enter a judgment in favor of the Government and against Defendants on all counts;

 of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands including but not limited to human trafficking, forced 
 labor and sexual servitude of female children and young women, unlawful sexual contact, child

 offenses, and civil conspiracy;

 sections), ands reviewing the rest. Two items to note — I tried to change subsequent cites to string cites where 
 caught them, but I wasn't reviewing closely for that, so make sure the paras are reviewing for that. Second, as I discussed 
 with -please take a look at the redactions in her section. I tried to conform them to the general principal that 
 redactions should apply to the subpoena and the ex parte proceeding, and un-redactions should apply to the description 
 of the article, her brief making general allegations, and our indictment. If that's not how you are envisioning the

 Good afternoon, 
 Our Counsel had a further question regarding the subpoena. In the subpoena, it states the Sacramento County 
 Clerk/Recorder is to appear in person to testify, and produce the requested record, at the U.S. District Court for 
 the Southern District of New York. Is this a requirement, or will presentation of the record to your office 
 suffice? 
 Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 The Court is currently in the process of planning logistics for trial in this matter and 
 requires the parties' best and current estimate of length of trial. The Court plans to have the jury 
 sit 5 days a week from 9am until 5pm. Given that jury selection will be complete by November 
 19 and opening statements will occur on November 29, the Court requests that the parties 
 provide their best estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. This will allow 
 the Court to assess the likelihood that trial may continue after the Christmas holiday and 
 therefore whether the jury may be required to sit some days during the week between Christmas 
 and New Year's Day. Accordingly, on or before October 12, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to 
 confer and submit a joint letter with their best and current estimate as to when the jury is likely to 
 begin deliberations.

 Office of 
 Victim Services 
 Claim Application and 
 Instructions 
 How to Apply for Compensation 
 Who can apply for compensation? 
 Innocent victims of crime, certain relatives, dependents, 
 legal guardians and eligible Good Samaritans can apply 
 to the Office of Victim Services (OVS) for compensation 
 of out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance or 
 other resources. 
 What kind of expenses can I get compensated 
 for? 
 OVS offers compensation related to personal injury, 
 death and loss of essential personal property. 
 The specific expenses OVS may cover include: 
 • Medical, pharmacy and counseling expenses 
 • Loss of Essential Personal Property (up to $500, 
 including $100 for cash) 
 • Burial or Funeral Expenses (up to $6.000) 
 • Lost Wages or Lost Support (up to $30.000) 
 (Parents or guardians of hospitalized minor children 
 may be eligible for this benefit) 
 • Transportation (court/medical) 
 • Occupational/Vocational Rehabilitation 
 • Security Devices and DV Shelter Costs 
 • Crime scene clean-up (up to $2.500) 
 • Good Samaritan property losses (up to $5,000) 
 • Moving expenses (up to $2,500) 
 How do I ask for compensation? 
 Send us your completed OVS application along with 
 copies of: 
 • Police reports 
 • Medical bills 
 • Correspondence with insurance companies 
 or benefits plan saying if they will cover your loss 
 • Insurance cards 
 • Receipts for essential personal property 
 • Death certificate and funeral contract 
 • Victim's birth certificate 
 • Proof of age (driver's license, birth certificate etc.) 
 • Legal guardianship papers 
 What if I don't have some of the papers OVS 
 needs? 
 Send your application in right away. You can send the 
 other documents later. 
 What if my property was lost, damaged or 
 destroyed because of the crime? 
 If you are under 18, 60 or over, disabled or were injured, 
 you may apply for benefits to replace your essential 
 personal property or cash that was not covered by any 
 other resource. 
 Essential means necessary for your health and welfare, 
 like eyeglasses and clothes. 
 What if I move? 
 Send OVS a signed letter right away. Tell us your new 
 address and phone number. Also let us know if your 
 email address changes. 
 Who can sign the claim? 
 Generally, the victim must sign the claim. However, if the 
 victim is under 18, or is physically or mentally incapable 
 of signing, then the legal guardian (the person receiving 
 the benefits) must fill out section 2 of the claim and sign 
 the claim. 
 If the victim died, the person asking for benefits must fill out 
 section 2 of the claim and sign the claim. 
 Is there another way to apply? 
 Yes. Visit ovs.ny.gov to access the secure Victim Service 
 Portal (VSP) and file an application on line. 
 Do I have to fill out the attached HIPPA form? 
 Yes. Fill out one HIPAA form for each service provider. 
 You can photocopy a blank form to make extra copies.

Court Ordered Restitution Information 
 What is restitution? 
 Restitution is compensation paid to a victim by the perpetrator of a criminal offense for the losses or injuries incurred as a 
 result of the criminal offense. It must be ordered by the Court at the time of sentencing, and is considered part of the sentence. 
 Restitution is NOT for payment of damages for future losses, mental anguish or "pain and suffering." 
 When the District Attorney's (DA) office advises the Court that you have requested restitution or when the victim impact 
 statement contained in the probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report) indicates that the 
 victim seeks restitution, the Court must order restitution unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. When the judge does 
 not order restitution, the judge must clearly state his/her reasons on the record. 
 What can I request as restitution? 
 You can ask for any expense you incur as a result of the criminal offense — even for items the OVS may not be able to 
 reimburse. Restitution may include, but is not limited to, reimbursement for medical bills, counseling expenses, loss of 
 earnings, funeral expenses, insurance deductibles and the replacement of stolen or damaged property. 
 Who is entitled to restitution? 
 Anyone who has been the victim of a criminal offense and has suffered injuries, economic losses or damages can seek 
 restitution. Many times, victims who deserve restitution do not request it. This can occur because victims are not aware that 
 they are entitled to restitution, or do not know what steps to take to go about receiving the restitution they deserve. 
 How do I ask for restitution? 
 You should contact the DA's office and advise them of the extent of your injury, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of 
 damages you are requesting. 
 It is your responsibility to give the police, DA and, upon request, the local probation department copies of the bills and 
 other documents showing the extent of your injuries, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you want 
 considered by the Court. Your claim for restitution will be included in any probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea 
 or pre-disposition report). Be sure to: 
 • Keep accurate records such as original receipts of any expenses you have as a direct result of the criminal offense. 
 • Give copies of these receipts to the police. DA and local probation department. 
 You need to clearly explain your need for restitution as soon as possible to the DA, the victim/witness advocate, and the 
 probation department. Plea agreements can occur within days of the actual criminal offense. If this information is not provided 
 before the plea agreement and sentencing, you may have to pursue the perpetrator in Civil Court. 
 The DA is under an obligation to petition the Court to order restitution on your behalf. 
 In all felony criminal cases, many misdemeanor criminal cases and all juvenile delinquency and persons in need of supervision 
 (PINS) cases, a pre-sentence or predisposition investigation report is required. The local probation department will contact you 
 about the issue of restitution as it pertains to your case. 
 How is restitution determined? 
 The amount of restitution is based on proof of your out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the criminal offense. The 
 perpetrator has a right to object to the amount of restitution. The Court may hold a hearing on the issue of restitution where the 
 Court may consider the perpetrator's ability to pay. The DA's office may contact you and ask you to testify at the restitution 
 hearing. If you have a concern about appearing personally in Court, you should explore alternatives with the DA assigned to 
 your case. 
 If the OVS has paid your bills, the Court may order that restitution payments be made to the OVS for those paid items. It is 
 important that you advise the DA's Office that you filed a claim with the OVS. 
 If you filed a claim with the OVS, it is important that you advise the OVS if the Court orders the perpetrator to pay restitution.

 Please call when you get this information. 
 (NY) (FBI) <E> 
 I have attached Registration information for N331JE and N722JE. N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is 
 just the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think 
 there is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in 
 court. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, 
 and leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or 
 more, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. 
 I have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. 
 I have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PII. I will send the password in a follow-on e-
 mail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I 
 have created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate 
 potentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I 
 created turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be 
 obtained at a later date. 
 As I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly 
 different from what was included in the original e-mail to me below.

 He did, but is the one who spoke directly with him, so he can give you the most detail. (I took off 
 this, so he doesn't respond with the substance and create needless 3500.) The most significant takeaway I recall 
 from summary was that 'a said he gave Epstein the sheets he used. But again, this is second-hand, 
 and has his own issues we can discuss separately.

 I just spoke with who got a call from an aspiring cooperator at MCC named IM=, 
 reported that another MCC inmate known as "i"—
 gave him information relating to Epstein. For 
 several months, has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and

Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
 most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
 only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
 country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
 believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
 useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
 the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise 
 we're of course happy to travel to her.) 
 Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
 working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
 generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types 
 up those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but 
 I can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
 With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
 investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
 witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
 change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
 been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
 course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
 follow-up via email.

 The Judge in Epstein's Case Should Not Turn the Dismissal Into a Drama for the Victims 
 NY Law Journal 
 By Bruce Green and Rebecca Roiphe 
 8/26/19 
 Last week, Judge Richard Berman ordered a hearing on the prosecutors' decision to dismiss the indictment against 
 Jeffrey Epstein, who had been charged with multiple counts of sex trafficking and assault before he committed 
 suicide in a Manhattan prison. The judge announced that he intends to allow victims to speak at the hearing, which 
 is scheduled for August 27th. Berman stated: "The court believes that where, as here, a defendant has died before 
 any judgment has been entered against him, the public may still have an informational interest in the process by 
 which the prosecutor seeks dismissal of an indictment." 
 This is an odd moment for transparency in a criminal case. Normally, if a prosecutor seeks to dismiss an 
 indictment for such an obviously worthy reason, the court would simply grant the request The judge would not 
 schedule a hearing and he definitely would not allow the victims to speak. And if he did hold a hearing, whatever 
 informational interests the victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to attend the hearing, not 
 by giving them a speaking role. 
 The procedural rules governing federal criminal cases do not provide for posthumous trials. If the accused dies 
 before trial, the federal court has no choice but to dismiss the indictment and end the case. Indeed, if an accused is 
 tried and found guilty but dies while his appeal is pending, the federal court must set the conviction aside, as if it 
 had never occurred. If a party to a civil lawsuit dies, his estate may step into his shoes. But in a criminal 
 prosecution, the defendant's estate cannot be asked to answer for the defendant's alleged crimes. 
 And so it is odd for the judge in this case to delay the inevitable dismissal, seemingly for dramatic effect. He has no 
 choice but to dismiss the charges. At the hearing he scheduled, Epstein's lawyers will not oppose the prosecution's 
 motion to dismiss the indictment. It is doubtful whether Epstein's former lawyers could oppose the prosecution's 
 motion even if they thought there were grounds to do so. Epstein's defense lawyers no longer have authority to 
 speak on his behalf: the lawyer-client relationship ended with his death. Nor would the victims have any plausible 
 grounds to ask the judge to continue the proceedings. 
 People are right to be both outraged and frustrated after Epstein's suicide. He was a true villain, as both sides of 
 the political divide agree: Epstein was hated by the #MeToo movement and conservatives alike. His suicide denied 
 the public an accounting for his egregious crimes. It left us all without a clear sense of how this rich and powerful 
 EFTA00018867
man evaded justice the first time, when he served a meager sentence, much of it on home arrest, for similar 
 charges. 
 That said, now that he is dead, the criminal justice system is not the place for Epstein to be called to account The 
 fact that the public has an interest in learning more about the process, as Berman suggested, does not mean that 
 victims have the right to speak at a criminal proceeding scheduled for no obvious purpose but to give them a 
 forum. One might think that there is no harm done in giving victims a chance to express themselves in the 
 scheduled hearing, but that is wrong for two reasons. 
 First, the criminal justice system is designed to determine whether defendants are guilty of alleged crimes beyond a 
 reasonable doubt in a fair process in which both the prosecution and defendant participate. While many people 
 assume that Epstein is guilty of the crimes alleged in the indictment and worse, our courts and constitution require 
 that we presume him innocent until proven otherwise. Individuals charged with crimes must be allowed a chance to 
 confront their accusers and put the government to its burden. Frustrating as it is that the government will never get 
 the chance to present its case in a trial against Epstein, it is important to preserve the institutional structures 
 nonetheless. Faith in the outcomes of run-of-the-mill cases require as much. 
 It is often important to hear from victims—for example, at a trial where the accused contests his guilt or in a 
 sentencing hearing after a defendant is found guilty. But conducting a hearing on an uncontested question solely to 
 give victims a chance to tell their stories would be a rare if not unprecedented use of the courtroom—one that not 
 only veers from the norm but also weakens the institutional commitments that are necessary to ensure that all 
 individuals accused of a crime are afforded proper protection. 
 Second, this seems more like a show than a real hearing. Judge Berman isn't really trying to obtain information 
 about why the government is dismissing its case. We all know why. The defendant is no longer alive. So the hearing 
 would necessarily be serving a different purpose: It might serve as a kind of theater at which the public works 
 through its frustration and unresolved need for retribution. It might afford a collective catharsis for the victims 
 who may be allowed to tell their stories in court and for other victims of sexual assault. These are both noble goals, 
 but they are outside of the criminal justice system's mandate. 
 We don't necessarily have to give up the goal of a public accounting. Not entirely anyway. Prosecutors in the 
 Southern District of New York have indicated that they are not done with the investigation, leaving many to 
 speculate that Epstein's co-conspirators will be charged. If so, the victims will get to tell their stories, at least 
 partially. In civil lawsuits and forfeiture actions, they may also have an opportunity for their day in court. But we 
 should not distort the criminal justice process by importing this perceived societal need into the criminal 
 courthouse when there is no proceeding in which hearing from the victims serves a legitimate criminal justice

 Investigators scrutinizing video outside Epstein's cell find some footage unusable, according to people 
 familiar with the inquiry 
 Washington Post 
 By Carol D. Leonnig and Matt Zapotosky 
 8/26/19 
 At least one camera in the hallway outside the cell where authorities say registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein 
 hanged himself earlier this month had footage that is unusable, although other, clearer footage was captured in 
 the area, according to three people briefed on the evidence gathered earlier this month. 
 It was not immediately clear why some video footage outside Epstein's cell is too flawed for investigators to use 
 or what is visible in the usable footage. The incident is being investigated by the FBI and the Justice 
 Department's inspector general's office, which are attempting to determine what happened and how to assess 
 whether any policies were violated or crimes committed. 
 The footage is considered critical to those inquiries, and the revelation of an unusable recording is yet another of 
 the apparent failures inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the short-staffed Bureau of Prisons facility in 
 downtown Manhattan that held Epstein. 
 It's unclear whether the flaw in the taping affected a limited duration of the footage or whether it was a chronic 
 problem in the beleaguered Manhattan facility. 
 A Bureau of Prisons spokesman declined to comment, as did spokespeople for the FBI, the Justice Department 
 and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. 
 The people who spoke about the footage did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing probe. 
 Epstein, a well-connected financier, had been charged in early July with sexually abusing dozens of young girls 
 in the early 2000s and ordered held without bond. The arrest brought a sense of long-awaited justice to those 
 who alleged Epstein abused them and who had earlier been dismayed by a 2008 plea deal he received to resolve 
 similar allegations that was widely criticized as too lenient. 
 That deal allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two state charges and spend just 13 months in jail, with work release 
 privileges. The new charges could have resulted in a prison term of as much as 45 years. 
 But on Aug. 10, the 66-year-old was found hanging in his cell. He was taken to a hospital, where he was later 
 pronounced dead. His death was ruled a suicide. 
 Prosecutors have since moved to drop the charges against Epstein — although they continue to investigate those 
 who might have conspired with him. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to consider the matter 
 and has indicated that those who say Epstein victimized them will be allowed to speak in court. 
 EFTA00018870
Meanwhile, there has been intense scrutiny of the federal facility where he was held, which did not follow its 
 protocol in the handling of Epstein in several ways, officials have said. 
 Epstein should have been checked on every 30 minutes in the jail's special housing unit, though it had been 
 several hours since the last check when he was discovered as staff members delivered breakfast. Investigators are 
 exploring whether logs were falsified to indicate checks had occurred when they had not, a person familiar with 
 the matter said. 
 The two officers on duty when Epstein apparently hanged himself were both working overtime — one forced, 
 the other voluntarily, officials have said. One did not normally work as a corrections officer, though he had in the 
 past and was allowed to do so, officials have said. 
 Epstein also was supposed to have a roommate, following a July 23 incident in which he was found on the floor 
 of his cell with marks on his neck. Authorities suspected he had attempted suicide; Epstein said he believed he 
 had been attacked. 
 He was placed on suicide watch for about a week after that — meaning he was monitored 24-7. He was placed 
 back in the jail's special housing unit late in the month and, for a time, had a new roommate. 
 But that person was transferred the day before Epstein's death, and a new roommate was not assigned — despite 
 the fact that at least eight jail officials knew Epstein was not to be left alone in his cell. 
 New York's chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, ruled Epstein's cause of death a suicide on Aug. 16. The 
 ruling came five days after the medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy and classified the cause of death 
 as pending while seeking additional information. 
 The pathologist's autopsy found Epstein suffered fractures in his neck bones, according to two people familiar 
 with the findings. Among the breaks in Epstein's neck was the hyoid bone, which in men is near the Adam's 
 apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, according to forensics experts and studies on the 
 subject. But they are typical in victims of homicide by strangulation, experts told The Post. Experts also caution 
 that such a break must be viewed in the context of the findings of a full autopsy to draw a conclusion about a 
 cause of death. 
 The hyoid bone becomes more brittle and is easier to break as people age. Epstein was 66. 
 Law enforcement officials have said they believe Epstein killed himself. 
 Lawyers for Epstein and his family had questioned Sampson's ruling of suicide and the thoroughness of the 
 investigation into Epstein's death. 
 "The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the 
 circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein's death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos —
 if they exist as they should — of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his 
 death," the lawyers said in an Aug. 16 statement. "We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical 
 examiner."

 The beast has been slayed. 
 I organized the files out of the jumble that they were brought to us in. A few things that will probably be helpful to know: 
 1. There were some commissary receipts/finance documents pertaining to Epstein's activity inside of prison. I didn't 
 know where to put this so I left it outside of the folders but still inside MCC Recs 
 2. In the MCC Regs folder, I put a few things: 
 a. One file had inventory and then at the end some documents pertaining to daily key counts. I wasn't sure 
 if these were different so I created a separate file for the key counts just in case (while also keeping them 
 in the inventory file) 
 b. The MCC training 06-06-19 & information file was confusing to me. It was massive and I couldn't tell 
 whether or not I needed to separate anything out. 
 EFTA00018872
Everything else should be pretty straightforward as to where it is located. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything 
 or help any further.

 Dear Judge Nathan:

 Government is docketing a redacted version today and submitting the unredacted versions to the 
 Court. The redline text in the documents reflect the objections of the defense. Further detail of 
 the parties' objections are contained in comment bubbles. 
 The Government has proposed the only redactions in the Request to Charge. These 
 proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in 
 Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government's 
 request to charge is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the 
 proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of a third party. 
 The Government is also providing under seal Exhibit A, which pertains to a defense 
 comment. The defense informs the Government that this exhibit is a document from another case

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 Dear Counsel: 
 Pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government 
 hereby provides notice that it may call as an expert witness at trial Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a clinical 
 instructor of psychiatry and human behavior at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University. 
 The Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly provide 
 notice if the Government elects to do so. 
 I. Disclosure by the Government 
 Dr. Lisa Rocchio is the President-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology of the 
 American Psychological Association ("APA"). Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since 
 earning her Ph.D. in 1995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School 
 of Brown University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since 
 she entered private practice in 1998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma, 
 including sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. In the last twenty-three years, Dr. Rocchio 
 has treated hundreds of victims of trauma, many of whom were minor victims of sexual abuse. 
 Dr. Rocchio has also received specialized training in traumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical 
 EFTA00018883
Page 2 
 and forensic psychology. She has written, presented, and taught about the assessment and 
 treatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2014, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review 
 board of the APA journal Trauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is 
 a member of the APA Ethics Committee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio's curriculum vitae is being 
 produced to you today bearing Bates number 3502-006.' 
 Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience, 
 and research to the following: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by 
 perpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of 
 manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, 
 rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic pattern 
 of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the 
 victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment 
 with their abuser. The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware 
 that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may 
 not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the 
 consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the 
 likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological 
 consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other 
 individuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that 
 nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for 
 a variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted 
 by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not 
 evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer 
 Dr. Rocchio's testimony regarding any specific victim. 
 Dr. Rocchio's expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological 
 trauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio's 
 extensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in 
 childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio's experience conducting forensic psychological 
 evaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is 
 producing notes from the Government's interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well. 
 II. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice 
 In light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal 
 notice under Rule 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert 
 witness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that 
 the defendant intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as 
 well as the witness's qualifications. 
 ' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal 
 and state litigation. As a courtesy, a list of that testimony is also being produced to you today 
 bearing Bates number 3502-002. 
 EFTA00018884
Page 3 
 Additionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery 
 under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: 
 (1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
 copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which 
 the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or 
 reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in 
 connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, 
 and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which 
 were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. 
 The Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior 
 statements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). The Government requests that such material 
 be provided on the same basis upon which the Government agrees to supply the defendant with 
 3500 material relating to Government witnesses.

 Ghislaine Maxwell Atty Likens Jail To 'Silence Of The Lambs' 
 An attorney representing Ghislaine Maxwell, former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, once again pressed a New York 
 federal court for her release, writing in a letter Wednesday that her prison conditions "rival scenes of Dr. 
 Hannibal Lecter's incarceration as portrayed in the movie, 'Silence of the Lambs."

 Dear Counsel: 
 Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
 Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
 case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
 The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
 Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
 These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
 Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
 contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
 these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
 has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
 Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
 enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
 that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial.

 Please note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are 
 governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, certain materials are 
 designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as 
 "confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as 
 "confidential" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to 
 cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid 
 potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to 
 note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this 
 case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO 
 PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to 
 the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. 
 Additionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are 
 represented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to 
 amend and supplement these disclosures.

 they talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) about the issue. The reporter believes

 CNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows that another reporter has similar information,

 Subject: Epstein Probate 
 Hi 
 The U.S. Virgin Islands court has recently posted on its website the petition that was filed in the Epstein probate 
 proceedings seeking establishment of a victim claims fund. The petition seeks "expedited approval" from the court to 
 establish the fund, though no timeline is specified. (It is attached, if of interest.) If approved, estate assets would be 
 used to pay for administering the fund, and deadlines would be set for victims to file their claims if they wish to 
 participate. 
 There was over a week's delay between when the petition was filed with the court and when the court posted the 
 petition on its public page for "cases of interest" That page is not an official case docket, though it has at least select 
 filings from the probate case (though I cannot tell if all filings are being posted). It would obviously be preferable if we 
 had contemporaneous access to a complete docket, but we haven't been able to find a way to access an online 
 complete docket. We're inclined to call the Virgin Islands court to ask whether there's a way to access a full electronic 
 docket, but we wanted to check whether you have concerns before we do so (we doubt we would need to identify 
 ourselves). Let us know your thoughts. 
 Relatedly, what's the status of the 6(e) order?

 EXPEDITED MOTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF 
 A VOLUNTARY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROGRAM 
 COME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"), 
 DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, and move this Honorable Court for an 
 expedited order to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program (the 
 "Program") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein, deceased, as 
 more fully described infra. As contemplated by the Co-Executors, the Program would provide all 
 eligible claimants an opportunity to receive compensation and voluntarily resolve their claims of 
 sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein through a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. 
 To be designed and implemented by independent, nationally recognized claims administration 
 experts, with input from interested parties including claimants and their representatives, the 
 Program would seek to timely resolve these claims through a process that is sensitive to the 
 experiences and concerns of claimants and treats them with compassion, dignity and respect. 
 I. BACKGROUND 
 As widely reported in the news media, multiple individuals have asserted or expressed their 
 intent to assert claims of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein (collectively, the "Sexual Abuse Claims"). 
 To date, twelve lawsuits involving Sexual Abuse Claims have been filed in the state and federal 
 courts of the State of New York, where claimants assert some of the complained-of conduct 
 occurred, and which recently amended its statute of limitations to permit such claims. These

 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 2 
 lawsuits name as defendants the Estate, the Co-Executors, and various entities owned or controlled 
 by Mr. Epstein prior to his death, as well as purported agents and employees of Mr. Epstein or 
 those entities. 
 Pursuant to this Court's order, Notice to Creditors was duly first published on 
 September 18, 2019. However, only one Sexual Abuse Claim has so far been filed in the Virgin 
 Islands. As noted above, claimants have named the Estate and others in various lawsuits in 
 jurisdictions outside the Virgin Islands and, based on media reports and statements by various 
 counsel for plaintiffs, the Co-Executors anticipate that more Sexual Abuse Claims may be filed in 
 various jurisdictions including New York, Florida, New Mexico and France. 
 Purpose of the Motion 
 • The Co-Executors believe that the interests of justice require the Estate to fairly 
 address and timely resolve the Sexual Abuse Claims, no matter where filed, as 
 a matter of national and international importance. As much of the value to 
 claimants lies in the fair and timely resolution of their claims, the Co-Executors 
 request that this Court grant the instant Motion expeditiously. 
 • Guided by independent, nationally recognized claims administration experts, 
 the Co-Executors have worked diligently to begin formulating a comprehensive 
 process for determination and resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims. If 
 approved by the Court, the Program would provide, to the fullest extent 
 possible, victims of sexual abuse access to a confidential claims resolution 
 process that does not entail the rigors and publicity of litigation. To our 
 knowledge, this Court is the first probate court that has been called upon to 
 approve the establishment of a mass tort-type program for achieving the fair, 
 EFTA00018906
Estate offebey Epstein Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 3 
 independent determination and resolutions of sexual abuse claims filed by 
 multiple claimants against a decedent's estate. As a matter of public policy 
 alone, the urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. 
 Development of the Program for evaluation and resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims, in 
 a manner designed to evaluate those claims in a confidential manner and to streamline their 
 determination by the country's most experienced claims administrators — individuals who have 
 designed, implemented and administered extensive mass tort programs including the September 
 1 I th Victim Compensation Fund, the Roman Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal, the BP 
 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Agent Orange toxic chemical matter, and 
 others — would be in the best interests of claimants, the Estate, its creditors and its beneficiaries. 
 Accordingly, in order to create a mechanism for the just and efficient resolution of the Sexual 
 Abuse Claims that will attract the voluntary participation of claimants, the Co-Executors request 
 the Court's authorization to use the Estate's funds to retain the services of the claims administration 
 experts described below, so that they may properly proceed with preparation of the Program and 
 design of an appropriate protocol to establish a fair, independent claims resolution process. 
 II. PROPOSED EPSTEIN VICTIMS' COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
 As contemplated by the Co-Executors, the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation 
 Program would ultimately function as follows: 
 Participation in the Program by claimants would be entirely voluntary, and would not affect 
 any rights a claimant has, unless and until the claimant accepts the Program's compensation 
 determination and executes a release. All claimants would be afforded an opportunity to meet 
 with the Program Administrator (described below) if they so desire, and will be treated with 
 compassion, dignity and respect. The planned situs of the Program would be in New York, where 
 EFTA00018907
Estate of JeJj5-ey Epstein Probate No. ST- I9-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 4 
 the majority of the Sexual Abuse Claims thus far have been filed, in order to alleviate the burden 
 of requiring claimants to travel to the Virgin Islands. Proceeding in that forum would also provide 
 claimants and their counsel with easier access to the Program Administrator, who is highly 
 qualified and experienced with this type of claims process, and is therefore likely to reduce the 
 overall costs of Program administration. The Program would be open to claimants wherever they 
 are located, and would use an electronic filing system to make the process available regardless of 
 the claimant's location. 
 A. PROPOSED MECHANICS AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
 PROGRAM 
 If this Court authorizes the Co-Executors to proceed with development of the proposed 
 Program, a detailed Program protocol (the "Protocol") would be designed by the claims 
 administration experts, with input from the Co-Executors and those with an interest in resolution 
 of the Sexual Abuse Claims (including claimants and their representatives), and submitted to the 
 Court for its approval. 
 A ten-point summary of the contemplated Program follows: 
 1. Participation in the Program would be entirely voluntary. 
 2. The Program would be available to all claimants with sexual abuse claims 
 against Mr. Epstein who satisfy certain eligibility criteria, as defined in the 
 Protocol. 
 3. While strict confidentiality will be required of the Program Administrator 
 and the Estate, each claimant would be free to disclose any and all 
 information concerning her participation in the Program, at claimant's sole 
 discretion, including information concerning the mechanics of the Program 
 and the resolution of her claim. 
 4. Claimants who elect to file a claim with the Program would be invited to 
 provide documentation identified in a claim form to be developed by the 
 claims administration experts, and any additional corroborating or 
 supporting information to help substantiate their claim. 
 EFTA00018908
Estate of Jeffrey Epstein Probate No. ST- 9-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 5 
 5. All claimants would be afforded a voluntary, confidential opportunity to 
 meet with the Program Administrator to provide additional information that 
 may bear upon evaluation of their claims. 
 6. Claims would be processed promptly and efficiently. Claimants would be 
 notified of any deficiency that prevents processing of their claim and 
 provided an opportunity to cure that deficiency. 
 7. Once a completed claim has been submitted, the Program Administrator 
 would evaluate that claim based on all available information and would 
 determine whether the claimant is eligible to receive compensation and the 
 amount of compensation to be paid. This independent, individual 
 determination will be based on factors and criteria identified in the Protocol. 
 The Estate will have no authority to reject or modify the independent 
 determination of the Program Administrator. 
 8. Upon issuance of a compensation determination by the Program 
 Administrator, the claimant would have complete freedom to accept or 
 reject that determination. If the claimant elects to accept the determination, 
 the claimant would execute a release waiving her right to litigate any claims 
 she may have against any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. 
 Epstein's conduct, as set forth in the Protocol. Upon the Program 
 Administrator's receipt of the claimant's acceptance of the compensation 
 determination and an executed release, the Program Administrator would 
 approve payment. The approval of any claim by the Program Administrator 
 will be deemed to have the effect of a claim "examined and approved" 
 within the meaning of 15 V.I.C. § 394, and, as already indicated, the Co-
 Executors would have no authority to reject or modify the Program 
 Administrator's determination of any compensatory award made in 
 accordance with the Protocol. 
 9. The Program Administrator will submit status reports to the Court on a 
 quarterly basis to provide updated information regarding the progress of the 
 Program, including the number of claims received, the number of claims 
 reviewed, the number of claims approved for payment, the aggregate value 
 of determinations issued, the aggregate value of determinations accepted, 
 and the aggregate value of determinations issued. 
 10. Following conclusion of the Program, the Program Administrator would 
 issue a Final Report to the Court and the Co-Executors summarizing the 
 Program. 
 EFTA00018909
Estate ofieffrry Epstein Probate No. ST-19-P840 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 6 
 B. PROPOSED CLAIMS PROCESS FOR PROGRAM PARTICIPATION 
 With respect to the timing and notice of claims, the Program would, if approved by the 
 Court, establish an effective commencement date and deadline for submission of all claims. A 
 claim form would be developed by the Program Administrator and disseminated to all known 
 claimants identified in a confidential database. Instructions for completing the form would be 
 included along with the form. The Program would operate and maintain a website that provides 
 general information about the Program, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, and 
 information about filing deadlines. Contact information for the Program would also be available 
 on the Program website. That website would also allow claimants, directly or through their 
 representatives, to register a new claim and/or upload their claim form or supporting documents to 
 facilitate submission and processing of individual claims. 
 C. PROPOSED DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
 OF THE PROGRAM 
 To establish the Program and design and implement the Protocol, the Co-Executors 
 propose engaging the services of independent, nationally recognized experts in this field: 
 Jordana H. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros, whose credentials are discussed 
 in Section D below. The Protocol developed by these experts, with input from the Co-Executors 
 and those with an interest in resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims (including claimants and their 
 representatives), would include eligibility criteria, the methodology for determining compensatory 
 damages, proof requirements and claims procedures, and timing, as follows: 
 • Eligibility. Identifying the criteria to determine whether a claimant is eligible to 
 receive compensation under the Program. 
 • Determination Methodology. Defining the factors and considerations to be used to 
 determine the amount of compensation to be offered to any eligible claimant. 
 EFTA00018910
Estate offeffrey Epstein Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 7 
 • Proof Requirements and Claims Procedures. Determining what types of 
 supporting documentation or other evidence each individual may be required to 
 submit to substantiate the claim, satisfy Protocol requirements, and allow the 
 Program Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. 
 • Timing. Expressly stating the timeframe of the Program, including an effective 
 commencement date and deadline for submission of all claims. 
 In addition to leading the design and implementation of the Program, Ms. Feldman would 
 serve as the Program Administrator and would administer the Program and process all claims. The 
 Program Administrator would have final decision-making authority relating to the administration, 
 evaluation and valuation of claims. As noted above, the approval of any claim by the Program 
 Administrator will be deemed to have the effect of a claim "examined and approved" within the 
 meaning of 15 V.I.C. § 394. 
 D. CREDENTIALS OF PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND DESIGNERS 
 The Program Administrator and Program Designers' qualifications for participation in the 
 Program are set forth below. 
 1. Jordana H. Feldman (Program Administrator & Designer) 
 • Ms. Feldman has spent her career engaged in the design, 
 implementation and administration of mass tort claims programs 
 and complex settlements as effective and creative alternatives to 
 litigation. 
 • Until recently, Ms. Feldman served as the Deputy Special 
 Master and Director of the New York Office of the September 
 1 1 th Victim Compensation Fund ("VCF"), the litigation-
 alternative program established in 2001 and reopened in 2011 to 
 compensate individuals who have become sick or died as a result 
 of their September 11th-related exposure, and administered by 
 the United States Department of Justice. She has worked on the 
 VCF for over ten years, playing a key role in developing 
 guidelines for eligibility and the valuation of losses, and 
 adjudicating thousands of claims, valued in the aggregate over 
 $12 billion. In that position, she has extensive experience 
 interviewing victims of the September 11 tragedy. 
 EFTA00018911
Estate of Jeffi-ey Epstein Probate No. ST-I9-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 8 
 • Before joining the Justice Department to work on the VCF, Ms. 
 Feldman worked in the complex dispute resolution practice at 
 the law firm Dickstein Shapiro, LLP, where she represented 
 clients in the design, implementation and administration of 
 complex settlements and mass claims resolution programs 
 arising out of class actions, legislation and Chapter 11 
 bankruptcy reorganizations. Before working at Dickstein 
 Shapiro, LLP, Feldman worked as a litigation associate at Fried, 
 Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. 
 • Ms. Feldman is the co-author of the Master Guide to Mass 
 Claims Resolution Facilities (2011) and graduated in 2000 from 
 the University of Pennsylvania Law School. She received her 
 undergraduate degree magna cum laude in 1997 from the 
 University of Pennsylvania. 
 2. Kenneth R. Feinberg (Program Designer) 
 • Mr. Feinberg is the nation's leading expert in mediation and 
 alternative dispute resolution, and the founder of the Law 
 Offices of Kenneth R. Feinberg, PC. He has been appointed to 
 administer numerous high-profile compensation programs, 
 having served as special master of the September 1 I th Victim 
 Compensation Fund, the Troubled Asset Relief Program 
 ("TARP') Executive Compensation Program, and the Agent 
 Orange Victim Compensation Program. 
 • Mr. Feinberg and his colleague Camille Biros have designed and 
 implemented the New York Archdiocese Independent 
 Reconciliation and Compensation Program for resolution of 
 claims of sexual abuse of minors by members of the clergy, as 
 well as similar compensation funds for the Dioceses of Brooklyn 
 and Rockville Centre, New York and for Dioceses in the states 
 of California, Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
 • Mr. Feinberg has served as adjunct professor of law at Harvard 
 Law School, Columbia Law School, University of Pennsylvania 
 School of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, New York 
 University School of Law, University of Virginia School of 
 Law, and Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Before his 
 academic career, he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the 
 Southern District of New York, special counsel for the U.S. 
 Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and founding partner of the 
 Washington office of the law firm Kaye Scholer LLP, among 
 other positions. 
 EFTA00018912
Estate of-Jeffrey Epstein Probate No. ST -19-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 9 
 • Mr. Feinberg graduated from New York University School of 
 Law in 1970 and received his undergraduate degree in 1967 
 from the University of Massachusetts. 
 3. Camille S. Biros (Program Designer) 
 • Ms. Biros is a nationally recognized expert in the design, 
 implementation and administration of public and private 
 compensation programs. She currently serves as Director, 
 Claims Administration, at the Law Offices of Kenneth R. 
 Feinberg, P.C. 
 • Ms. Biros and Mr. Feinberg have designed and implemented the 
 New York Archdiocese Independent Reconciliation and 
 Compensation Program for resolution of claims of sexual abuse 
 of minors by members of the clergy, as well as similar 
 compensation funds for the Dioceses of Brooklyn and Rockville 
 Centre, New York and for Dioceses in the states of California, 
 Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Ms. Biros has served 
 as the primary Administrator of these various funds. 
 • Ms. Biros has also served as Administrator of the DuPont 
 Medical Monitoring Program, Deputy Administrator of the Gulf 
 Coast Claims Facility after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, 
 Deputy Administrator of the GM Ignition Switch Compensation 
 Program and Deputy Special Master of the September 11th 
 Victim Compensation Fund. 
 III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
 In their fiduciary capacity, the Co-Executors have engaged in discussions with relevant 
 parties in interest regarding the independent, fair and timely resolution of the Sexual Abuse 
 Claims. It is their understanding that many existing and potential claimants would prefer to 
 participate in the Program, if fairly and expeditiously administered, rather than proceeding with 
 litigation. Furthermore, although there would be significant expense in developing and 
 administering the Program, the Co-Executors anticipate that the Program would substantially 
 reduce the expenses to the Estate of litigating multiple lawsuits in numerous jurisdictions, and thus 
 would ultimately reduce expenses to the benefit of all parties with an interest in the Estate, 
 EFTA00018913
Estate ofJeffrey Epstein Probate No. ST- I9-PB-80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 10 
 including claimants and creditors.' The expedited nature of the planned Program would also 
 ensure resolution and compensation to claimants in a far more timely manner than through 
 litigation. Additionally, the Protocol associated with the Program would be designed to ensure the 
 proportionate restitution of approved claims for all claimants, in a manner that would provide 
 similar compensation to similarly situated claimants. The Co-Executors submit that such a 
 Program is in the best interests of both the claimants and the Estate because, among other things, 
 it avoids the potential of disproportionate and inconsistent awards and should help to reduce the 
 time, expense and burden of handling claims through the courts, which could involve years of 
 litigation and appeals and consume enormous resources, along with inflicting costs attendant to 
 delay and uncertainty on all affected parties. 
 Rule 1 of the Virgin Islands Probate and Fiduciary Rules states that, "[w]here no procedural 
 provision is included herein, procedures set forth in the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure 
 may be adapted by the court as appropriate." In this regard, Rule 90 of the Virgin Islands Rules 
 of Civil Procedure evinces a clear intent in favor of the use of alternative dispute resolution to 
 resolve civil disputes. Thus, it is respectfully submitted that the establishment here of a voluntary 
 claims resolution program is within the Court's authority and would serve the interests of justice. 
 Furthermore, development and implementation of the Program, and the claims process 
 contemplated therein, is within the Court's sound discretion to establish a process by which the 
 rights of claimants will be fairly and efficiently ascertained and administered. See 5 V.I.C. § 1264 
 I. Such lawsuits have already begun to generate substantial costs and fees for both the Estate and claimants. The 
 expenses of litigation are expected to ratchet up significantly in coming months, absent implementation of the 
 Program as an alternative path for resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims. 
 EFTA00018914
Estate ofleffrey Epstein Probate No. ST-I 9-PB.80 
 Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 11 
 (allowing the court to declare tights, status and other legal relations of various classes of creditors 
 or other interested parties of a trust or estate). 
 At this juncture, the Co-Executors seek the Court's authorization to use Estate funds to 
 retain the services of the proposed Program Administrator and Program Designers   Ms. 
 Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — so that they may promptly proceed with preparation of 
 the Program and design of the Protocol to establish a fair, independent claims resolution process. 
 Once the Protocol is developed and finalized, the Co-Executors would submit it to the Court for 
 approval and would seek an order to formally commence claims resolution proceedings under the 
 Program. 
 Finally, the Co-Executors seek the Court's approval to submit under seal the proposed 
 engagement agreement of the Program Administrator and Program Designers, as it is proprietary 
 to the extent it establishes a methodology and formula for their compensation. Given the very 
 small group of people sufficiently qualified to design, implement and administer the proposed 
 Program and contemplated Protocol, the terms under which they are engaged would be subject to 
 intense scrutiny and may have the unintended effect of distracting from the Program. The Co-
 Executors will of course disclose the fees for services rendered by the Program Administrator and 
 Program Designers as they are accounted for by the Estate.

 Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein 
 Dear Ms. Butner: 
 As you are aware, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New 
 York ("USAO") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") are conducting an ongoing 
 criminal investigation into the events related to Mr. Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") (the "Criminal Investigation"). As you are also aware, 
 between August 10, 2019, and August 16, 2019, at OCME's request and in order to assist OCME 
 in determining the cause and manner of Mr. Epstein's death, the USAO and FBI gave OCME 
 access to certain materials and information gathering during the Criminal Investigation. 
 As discussed by phone, while the OCME autopsy is now complete, the Criminal 
 Investigation remains ongoing. As such, and in order to avoid compromising the Criminal 
 Investigation, we request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party any documents, 
 evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI—including documents, 
 records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within the OCME case file that 
 include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI. We also 
 request that you withhold from any disclosure the names and identifying information of any federal 
 law enforcement agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the 
 substance of any statements or interviews made by those agents or employees.

 We appreciate your willingness to comply with this request. Should you decide at any 
 future point, notwithstanding this request, to produce any of the above-referenced material to any 
 third party, we request that you notify us before you do so, so that we may seek additional process.

 Re: United States v. Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, No. 19 Cr. 830 
 Dear Counsel: 
 We write in response to your discovery request letters, dated January 29, 2020. This letter 
 and the content herein is designated as "Protected Materials" pursuant to the Protective Order 
 entered in this matter. 
 Thomas Request. The Government refers to its prior response to this request, as stated at 
 the November 25, 2019 pretrial conference. 
 Noel Requests No. 1-10, 12-13. We note, at the outset, that many of these requests are 
 extremely broad and pertain to information that does not appear to be relevant to the case. To the 
 extent material called for by these requests is within the Government's possession and subject to 
 disclosure at this time, the Government has already disclosed such information to you, including 
 by letter dated January 24, 2020. To the extent these requests call for information that is not 
 currently in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no 
 legal basis or authority for these requests, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to 
 obtain and/or disclose this information. 
 Noel Request No. II. The name of the MCC technician referenced in the Government's 
 previous letter is Hughwon Daniel. 
 Noel Request No. 16. The Government has already produced the available video 
 surveillance in its possession for July 23, 2019 for the Special Housing Unit. The Government 
 attaches hereto two public filings in United States v. Tartaglione, 16 Cr. 832 (KMK), which 
 reference these issues. 
 06.20.2018 
 EFTA00018948
Page 2 
 Noel Requests No. 14-5, 17-23. These requests, in general terms, call for information about 
 where particular evidence may be located within the discovery produced to date. As you note, you 
 seek this information to "assist in expediting the ability of the defense to be ready for trial." 
 Accordingly, with respect to Noel Requests No. 14-15, 17-23, at your request and solely as a 
 courtesy to aid you in your review of discovery, the Government is providing the information that 
 follows. The Government's response to your requests should not be used for any other purpose, 
 nor should it be construed as a representation that only these files or portions of the surveillance 
 video are potentially relevant to the Government's case or any potential defense, or as a 
 representation that the identified portions are the only portions of surveillance video that would be 
 responsive to your requests. The Government expressly reserves the right to identify and/or offer 
 at trial additional material as probative of any of the issues identified in these requests. 
 Noel Request No. 14. With respect to August 9, 2019, we direct your attention to the 
 following video files: CH0080_20190809195956; CH0080_20190809205956, 
 CH0080_20190809215956; CH0080_20190809225956. With respect to August 10, 2019, the 
 following video files contain this activity: CH0080_20190809235959; 
 CH0080_20190810005959; CH0080_20190810025959; CH0080_20190810035959; 
 CH0080_20190810045959; and CH0080_20190810055959. 
 Noel Request No. 15.  While the Government has not conducted a review of every time 
 Jeffrey Epstein was captured on MCC surveillance during the more than 30 days he was housed 
 there prior to his death and does not purport to provide such an exhaustive response, as a courtesy 
 and to aid in your review of the discovery, we direct your attention to the following: on August 9, 
 2019 Epstein was captured leaving his cell to make a phone call at approximately 18:53:54 -
 18:54:46 (CH0080_20190809175956). Epstein was escorted back to his cell at approximately 
 19:49:25 — 19:49:39 (CH0080_20190809185956). 
 Noel Request No. 17. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809145956 and 
 CH0080_20190809155956, during approximately 15:45:00 — 16:15:00 on August 9, 2019. 
 Noel Request No. 18. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809205956 and 
 CH0080_20190809215956, during approximately 19:45:00 — 20:15:00 on August 9, 2019. 
 Noel Request No. 19. We direct your attention to file CH0080_20190809215956, during 
 approximately 22:29:00 — 22:34:00. 
 Noel Request No. 20. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809225956 
 CH0080_20190809235959, during approximately 23:45:00 (August 9) — 00:15:00 (August 10). 
 Noel Request No. 21. The Government does not presently believe this interaction was 
 captured by surveillance video. 
 Noel Request No. 22. The Government refers you to the forensic examination of the 
 computers used by defendants Noel and Thomas during August 9 to 10, 2019, which were 
 previously produced in discovery (SDNY_00000021 - SDNY_00000075). The Government also

 06:20:00 as to defendant Noel, and approximately (8/10) 00:35:00 — 01:15:00 and (8/10) 06:00:00 
 — 06:20:00 as to defendant Thomas. 
 Noel Request No. 23.  The Government refers you to files CH0080_20190810005959, 
 CH0080_20190810015959, and CH0080_20190810025959 during approximately 00:01:00 —

 That's an extremely expansive question. As one example, just from our research into his trafficking-related cases, we 
 identified more than 30 attorneys who have represented him (in connection with at least 20 cases in federal court alone). 
 Similarly, e.g., at just Deutsche Bank he had more than 60 separate accounts. From his AmEx records, he paid for nearly 
 5,000 flights for individuals (many repeating, obviously, but still) in the past ten years. Etc. 
 As a threshold reference, see the attached spreadsheet, particularly the "Witnesses and CCs" and "Epstein attys" tabs. On 
 bank accounts, see the attached Deutsche Bank index spreadsheet with 2,000 rows of account (and relevant individuals) 
 information. On associated individuals, a useful reference may be AmEx records, particularly the "AIRLINE" tab; that 
 document is much too large to send via email, but I've put a copy in the following folder that Nick you have access to: 
 In terms of people who would (or would potentially be able to) send money on his behalf, I think the likeliest individuals 
 would be Darren Indyke, Jeffrey Schantz, and/or 
 Obviously please let us know if you intend to contact or interview anyone in his world, and of course let us know if any 
 additional information would be helpful.

 Hi, 
 Do you folks have a list of current known associates of Epstein? Anyone, including an attorney or some other agent, who 
 he might communicate with, or who would send money on his behalf? Names, phone numbers, or bank accounts would 
 be helpful. Thanksl

 It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic 
 information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get 
 either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with 
 someone? 
 I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and 
 given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please 
 advise.

 Ms. Greenfield, 
 Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
 with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
 As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
 reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to 
 her trauma or causing re-victimization. 
 As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
 U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
 U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
 spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
 been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
 Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
 believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
 hope to speak with her. 
 Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
 not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
 particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that 
 would be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
 In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein 
 and his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
 directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
 employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences 
 and observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general 
 nature of the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the 
 specifics if she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first 
 meeting. 
 Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
 would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

 It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic

 either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with

 apparently no AUSA assigned yet to the FBI side, but for example I would want to let FBI and 016 know that someone is

 Yeah of course. In some ways I actually hope this is a hoax because if not, it's completely insane. And I just called

 Separately, and speaking of the FBI investigation, defense counsel also says that they're starting to get people calling them 
 who claim to have information relevant to Epstein's death, and are wondering if there is an investigative point person to 
 whom they can direct any such people?

 I'll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, I just received a phone call from defense counsel that a 
 person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named (phonetic) who claimed to be 
 an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein's body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and 
 that the individual could make arrangements for retrieval of the body. left his phone number as 
 Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably 
 concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate 
 information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is 
 information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his 
 counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate. 
 (Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely 
 concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would 
 want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, 
 obviously.) 
 Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.

 Please see the attached emails regarding Suicide Watch and Psychological Observation. Suicide Watch and Psychological 
 Observation occur in cells on the second floor. The only difference is that while on Suicide Watch inmates are not 
 permitted to have clothes in their cell. 
 Some questions I just asked Lt. Doctor this morning: 
 1) Are there logs slips for the head counts done at 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.? If so, can we get copies? 
 She is getting us those forms. 
 2) Who was Epstein's last cellmate? 
 . He had court on 8/9/19 and was released from 500 Pearl St. According to 
 the BOP webpage he was released from custody and his location now is unknown. was a regular SHU 
 inmate, not special trainings according to his file. 
 3) Was Epstein supposed to have a cellmate? 
 According to Lt. Doctor, there was not a requirement for him to have a cellmate. 
 4) Who assignments cellmates? 
 Any officer can assign cellmates, as long as there are no "conflicts." The only person Epstein was not permitted to 
 be cellmates with was "Tartaglione", who was his cellmate during his first suicide attempt.

 Hi all, 
 The only other SONY case I am aware of (although I may not have heard of others) is/was being handled M, copied here. 
 I do not know the status of that case, which I believe was against the FBI. 
 Otherwise, I thought was keeping a list of Epstein-related FOIA requests, but I don't think they were all in 
 litigation. 
 Thanks,

 during the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don't 
 work, let me know and we will work out an alternate time. 
 In the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the case 
 files and also boxes of files that were gathered for the OPR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also OPR 
 has their own inventory of the materials. 
 When OPR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the 
 documents that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own DOJ accounts. I was overseas at the 
 time on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well. 
 A copy of our inventory is attached.

 EFTA00019001
Ghislaine Maxwell moves under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell v. Intl TeL & TeL 
 Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), and the Fifth Amendment, to suppress all evidence the 
 government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and to 
 dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
 Factual Background 
 The facts relevant to this Motion are described in Maxwell's Pretrial Motion No. 3 and 
 the Reply in Support Thereof. 
 Argument 
 I. The Government's violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression. 
 The government does not defend the overbreadth of its subpoena, or even respond to 
 Maxwell's argument. Resp. at 82-95. The government also does not deny that the subpoena 
 effected both a search and a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Id. 
 Instead, the government argues that (1) Maxwell has no standing to challenge the 
 subpoena; (2) the government acted in good faith; and (3) the government inevitably would have 
 come to possess the 90,000-sum pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller. 
 The facts and law belie the government's claims. 
 A. Maxwell has standing. 
 The government's standing argument boils down to this: Maxwell cannot challenge the 
 search because the material was in the possession of a third party and Maxwell lacked a 
 reasonable expectation of privacy. Resp. at 84-86. This argument fails. 
 Abundant authority holds that when confidential material is in the possession of a third-
 party, a defendant has standing to challenge a grand jury subpoena of that material. Matter of 
 Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Feb. 18, 1988, 685 F. Supp. 49, 51 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) 
 (law firm could intervene and join motion to quash grand jury subpoena issued to private 
 EFTA00019002
investigation firm). "The governing rule in these circumstances is that the possessor of the 
 claimed privilege or right may intervene to assert it." Id. (quoting Appeal of Hughes, 633 F.2d 
 282, 288 (3d Cir. 1980)). See also US Bank Nat. Ass'n v. PHL Variable Ins. Co., No. 12 CIV. 
 6811 CM JCF, 2012 WL 5395249, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2012) ("A party [has] standing to 
 challenge . . . a subpoena served on a non-party ... [when] the moving party assert[s] some right 
 or privilege personal to it, such as an interest in proprietary, confidential information that would 
 be disclosed or an interest in maintaining a privilege that would be breached by disclosure." 
 (citing cases)). In turn, in determining whether there is standing, "[c]ourts should consider 
 whether the information itself is private, confidential, privileged, or highly sensitive, and not the 
 form the records take." Refco Grp. Ltd., LLC v. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., No. 13 CIV. 1654 RA 
 HBP, 2014 WL 5420225, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2014). 
 In United States v. Lavender, the Second Circuit held that while a defendant could not 
 file an interlocutory appeal of the district court's denial of his motion to quash a third-party 
 subpoena, he was "free to raise his Fourth Amendment claims via motions to suppress...." 583 
 F.2d 630, 632 (2d Cir. 1978). Since Maxwell never had notice of the subpoena to Boies Schiller, 
 she is doing here exactly what Lavender allows: filing a motion to suppress. 
 To be sure, if the government were right—that the mere fact of a third-party's possession 
 of property eliminates a defendant's standing—then Carpenter v. United States would have 
 come out differently, since the defendant's historical cell-site location information was in the 
 possession of MetroPCS and Sprint. 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2212 (2018). But the United States 
 Supreme Court rejected application of the third-party doctrine for two reasons, as this Court 
 should here. 
 2 
 EFTA00019003
First, the Court recognized that 
 [t]here is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information 
 addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location information 
 casually collected by wireless carriers today. The Government thus is not asking 
 for a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant 
 extension of it to a distinct category of information. 
 Id. at 2219. Second, the Court concluded that in "in no meaningful sense" did Carpenter 
 voluntarily "assume the risk" of "turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical 
 movements." Id. at 2220. 
 The same logic applies here. There is "world of difference between the limited types of 
 personal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive" and personal details 
 about Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller's 90,000 pages of confidential material. 
 These details include, for example, information about Maxwell's sexual partners, sexual habits, 
 finances, and much, much more. 
 Moreover, "in no meaningful sense" did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with 
 Boies Schiller. Giuffre sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the 
 only claim Giuffre ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing 
 to do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide. 
 Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for 
 severance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell Pre-Trial Mot. 
 Nos. 4 8c 5. 
 But the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrow, but Boies 
 Schiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and 
 Maxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing Giuffre, which then compelled Maxwell, over 
 objection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal questions. None of it was 
 voluntary. 
 3 
 EFTA00019004
In addition to the inapplicability of the third-party doctrine, the government's response 
 fails to account for two other, dispositive facts proving that Maxwell has a reasonable 
 expectation of privacy. First, the Protective Order by its terms affords Maxwell a reasonable 
 expectation of privacy. Mot. 3, Ex. Al 3 (defining "CONFIDENTIAL" information as that 
 which "implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of . . . Ghislaine Maxwell" 
 (emphasis added)). What would it say to civil litigants if they could not rely on a court's promise 
 of confidentiality, at least absent notice and an opportunity to object to any breach of that 
 promise (which, of course, Maxwell was denied here). See Mot. 3, Ex. A, ¶ 14 (precluding 
 modification of the Protective Order absent "good cause shown following notice to all parties 
 and an opportunity for them to be heard"). 
 Second, Martindell affords Maxwell a reasonable expectation of privacy. Martindell, 594 
 F.2d at 294. In Martindell, the Second Circuit held that "the proper procedure" to obtain 
 confidential material under a Protective Order, "as the Government should know, was either to 
 subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a grand jury 
 investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to quash or modify the 
 subpoena, [Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)] or to seek permissive intervention in the private action 
 pursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)], for the purpose of obtaining vacation or modification of the 
 protective order." Id. (emphasis added)). By affording Maxwell a right to notice and an 
 opportunity to be heard, Martindell makes clear that, having been denied those rights when the 
 subpoena was first issued, Maxwell has standing to challenge the government's conduct now. 
 Id.; see Lavender, 583 F.2d at 632.

B. There is no good faith. 
 The rebuttal to government's good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith 
 when the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search. 
 As the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon, 
 Suppression ... remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing 
 a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false 
 or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth. 
 468 U.S. 897, 923 (1984). 
 Here, as explained in Maxwell's due process motion to suppress and the reply in support 
 thereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order 
 and authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the 
 government acts in objective bad faith. 
 C. The government's inevitable discovery doctrine fails. 
 There are several reasons the government's inevitable discovery argument fails. 
 First, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's 
 exclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442-43 (2d Cir. 2013) (reversing 
 district court's denial of motion to suppress, which was based on "the inevitable discovery 
 doctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule"). The doctrine has no 
 applicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence 
 obtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to 
 vindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States 
 v. Cortina, 630 F.2d 1207, 1216 (7th Cir. 1980) ("The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is, 
 in one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government's] offense was committed within 
 the sanctity of the court itself."). 
 5 
 EFTA00019006
Second, the government's inevitable discovery doctrine is far too speculative. The 
 "typical application" of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when "the government seeks to 
 invoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring 
 inventory searches." Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government's "inevitability analysis in this 
 case," however, "is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by 
 third parties," such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are "not acting at the behest of 
 the police." Id. "Such an analysis is inherently speculative." Id. 
 In fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against 
 Maxwell or Epstein's estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going 
 unsealing process in Giuffre v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein, 
 Doe v. Indyke, No. 20-cv-484-JLIC, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery, 
 saying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell. 
 By contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v. 
 Maxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in 
 misleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to 
 Boies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allowing the unsealing process to 
 unfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it now makes. This Court should not 
 condone such gamesmanship.' 
 Third, the government's inevitable discovery argument is far too broad. Even the 
 government admits that the vast majority of material it obtained from Boies Schiller is not on the 
 Giuffre v. Maxwell docket and has not been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the 
 government's response appears to concede that its inevitable discovery argument is limited to 
 ' As the government recognizes, Judge Preska recognized this possibility, but deferred to this 
 Court on the question since it is presiding over the criminal case. Resp. at 94 n.41. 
 6 
 EFTA00019007
Maxwell's two deposition transcripts, Resp. at 94 & n.41. And as to Count 6 in particular 
 (alleging perjury in the July 2016 deposition), the government concedes, as it must, that Judge 
 Preska has refused to unseal all of the testimony charged in the indictment, except one question 
 and one answer. Resp. at 94 n.41. The government offers no explanation for how it inevitably 
 would have obtained all 90,000 pages of material from Boies Schiller when the two deposition 
 transcripts don't even total 1,000 pages. 
 Fourth, the government misunderstands the burden of proof. The government tries to 
 fault Maxwell for seeking "suppression of all evidence [it] obtained pursuant to the subpoena," 
 calling this a "windfall." Resp. at 95. But it's the government's burden to prove the applicability 
 of the inevitable discovery exception. Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (inevitable discovery doctrine 
 applies only "if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably 
 without the constitutional violation") (rejecting government's inevitable discovery claim). The 
 government must explain why Maxwell isn't entitled to this remedy, not the other way around. 
 The government has fallen far, far short of meeting its burden, if only because it offers no 
 argument —on the facts or the law—for how it might have inevitably discovered more than 
 89,000 pages of material that hasn't been and won't be unsealed by Judge Preska. This Court 
 should have no confidence, much less a "high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies 
 necessary to the legal discovery of the contested evidence would be resolved in the government's 
 favor." United States v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2006) (articulating inevitable discovery 
 standard). 
 The inevitable discovery doctrine does not apply. 
 II. The Government's violation of Martindell requires suppression. 
 The government ignores the primary argument Maxwell made in her Motion: The 
 government circumvented Martindell, and deprived Maxwell of due process, by securing a 
 7 
 EFTA00019008
modification of the Protective Order in an ex parte hearing (chock full of misrepresentations) 
 without first providing Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard. Mot. No. 11, at 11-15. 
 The government offers no response to this fundamental point—Martindell demands notice and 
 an opportunity to be heard; Maxwell received neither. Resp. at 76—81. 
 Now, in an audacious request, the government argues this Court cannot evaluate the 
 propriety of Chief Judge McMahon's analysis of Martindell, because Judge McMahon is a co-
 equal judge who exercised her sound discretion. Resp. at 81 & n.37. Were the government's 
 unsupported argument correct, though, it would mean that Maxwell will never have an 
 opportunity to challenge the subpoena under Martindell, as that case and due process require. 
 The government is not right. 
 This Court does not owe deference to Judge McMahon's decision, for at least three 
 reasons. First, Maxwell never was given the chance to oppose the government's request, so due 
 process demands that she be given that chance now. Second, Chief Judge McMahon did not 
 possess all the relevant facts because the government improperly concealed them from her. To 
 the contrary, the government misled Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies Schiller and 
 the origins of its investigation, facts that were central to Judge McMahon's decision to modify 
 the Protective Order and authorize the subpoena. Mot. No. 3 & Reply in Support Thereof. Third, 
 this Court is not tasked with deciding whether the Protective Order should be modified or even 
 questioning the correctness of Judge McMahon's modification. This Court is deciding a different 
 question entirely—whether the government's violation of Martindell requires suppression. 
 As to remedy, the government says that no case addresses whether suppression is proper 
 for a Martindell violation. Fair enough. Resp. at 81. 
 8 
 EFTA00019009
But that's doubtless because that law has been clear for forty-two years that the 
 government can modify a civil Protective Order and then subpoena confidential material only 
 after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to respond. Martindell, 594 F.2d at 
 294 (Martindell decided in 1979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil Protective Order at 
 the government's request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST. 
 amend. V. 
 That no case has addressed the remedy for a Manindell violation is evidence only of (1) 
 the government's prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or 
 (2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, however, (1) the 
 government violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction. 
 Suppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is 
 grounded in due process principles, and the government's conduct here violated Maxwell's right 
 to due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an 
 opportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard, 
 594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, 1 14. But Maxwell had no idea that 
 the Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the 
 government disclosed the 90,000 pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.' The 
 government's due process violation warrants suppression. E.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d 122, 
 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (suppression for due process violation). 
 Second, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice 
 and an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon, 
 2 To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet's 
 passing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be 
 unsealed —apparently does not know the Protective Order was modified. 
 9 
 EFTA00019010
suppression is proper under this Court's inherent and supervisory authority. Mot. No. 3 & Reply 
 in Support Thereof. 
 III. The Government's violation of the Fifth Amendment requires suppression. 
 The government offers three responses to Maxwell's Fifth Amendment argument. None 
 is persuasive. 
 The government's first response is to deny any state action. Resp. at 99-100. But as even 
 the government admits, a private party, like Boies Schiller, is deemed to be an agent of the state 
 when the government "has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that 
 the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State." Resp. at 99 (quoting United States v. 
 Stein, 541 F.3d 130, 146 (2d Cir. 2008)). Here, based on the record of the government's contacts 
 with Boies Schiller in the months before and after Maxwell's depositions, there is at least a 
 genuine question of fact as to the government's role in encouraging Boies Schiller. 
 We know that the government contemplated a perjury prosecution of Maxwell, as seen in 
 the government's newly-disclosed notes from the meeting. Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. K, p 
 5. And if the government is to be believed, there was only one meeting with Boies Schiller, two 
 months before Maxwell's first deposition. If the government was contemplating a perjury 
 prosecution before Maxwell even testified, it stands to reason that Boies Schiller and the 
 government discussed at the February 29 meeting a plan to set a perjury trap for Maxwell. 
 Indeed, the contemporaneous notes of the February 29 meeting show that Boies Schiller 
 promised to send the government "depositions," Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. J, p 8, and 
 David Boies later complained about his frustration that the government had not yet charged 
 10 
 EFTA00019011
Maxwell with perjury.; There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and 
 Boles Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller's conduct was in part at the government's 
 behest. 
 The record in the Giuffre case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as 
 well. Based on Giuffre's claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her 
 deposition, that Giuffre disclose any alleged "on-going criminal investigation by law 
 enforcement" or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation. 
 Ex. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess "the 
 impact on any 5th Amendment privilege." Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms. 
 Maxwell the requested relief. Ex. B. 
 The day before Maxwell's April 2016 deposition, however, Judge Sweet ordered that 
 "[a]ny materials that [Giuffre] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over 
 [by Giuffre] except for any statements made by [Giuffre] to law enforcement authority." Ex. B, p 
 21. Maxwell had in fact served a discovery request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet 
 Giuffre produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day. 
 In reliance on the Protective Order, which included no exception for any law enforcement 
 need or subpoena and based on Giuffre's failure to disclose any "ongoing criminal 
 investigation," Maxwell did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination 
 during that deposition and testified truthfully. 
 As explained in Maxwell's Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the 
 government has now disclosed several documents "with respect to any criminal investigations" 
 3 Stephen Rex Brown, Manhattan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and 
 Ghislaine Maxwell case in 2016, New York Daily News (Oct. 13, 2020), 
 https://www.nydailynews.corninew-yorlany-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-20201013-
 jinzh17zdrzdgrbbs7yc6binszu-stoty.html.
 11 
 EFTA00019012
that Giuffre possessed in February and March 2016. Under Judge Sweet's pre-deposition order, 
 Giuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2016 deposition. 
 Giuffre's failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet's order, is compelling evidence 
 that Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when 
 deposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an 
 evidentiary hearing is appropriate. 
 The government's second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth Amendment right. 
 Resp. at 100. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knowingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745 
 F.3d 15, 23 (2d Cir. 2014). And "'knowing' means with full awareness of the nature of the right 
 being abandoned and the consequences of abandoning it." Id. 
 Here, Maxwell did not knowingly waive her Fifth Amendment right. She declined to 
 invoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the Protective Order, and on the 
 understanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it 
 turned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies 
 Schiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material 
 Judge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right 
 and avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her. 
 It is for this reason that the government fails in its attempt to distinguish United States v. 
 Oshatz, 700 F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Resp. at 102. The government says that the logic of 
 Oshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here, 
 Maxwell was deposed "over two years before the Government opened its investigation." Resp. at 
 100; id. at 102 (noting that the defendant in Oshatz "had already been indicted at the time of his 
 deposition in a civil case for almost seven months"). Of course, this argument depends on the 
 12 
 EFTA00019013
government's claim that its investigation of Maxwell did not start until 2018. But based on the 
 discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Pretrial Motion No. 3, we know the 
 investigation actually began as early as 2016, when two months before Maxwell's first 
 deposition, Boies Schiller met with the government and pressed an investigation for, among 
 other things, per hay. This Court should adhere to Oshatz and, as the court there granted the 
 motion to quash, here it should grant the motion to suppress. 
 The government's final argument is a red herring. Resp. at 103. Maxwell's argument is 
 not, and has never been, that a Protective Order cannot be modified. Maxwell agrees that, under 
 Martindell, and after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to be heard, 
 modification of a Protective Order is appropriate if the government can show "improvidence in 
 the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling 
 need." 594 F.2d at 296. Here, Maxwell was never given notice and an opportunity to be heard, 
 and Chief Judge McMahon's finding of "extraordinary circumstances" was fatally tainted by the 
 government's misrepresentations to her about the origins of its investigation. 
 IV. The Court should hold an evidentiary hearing. 
 Because there are genuine disputes of material fact, and for the reasons given in 
 Maxwell's Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, this Court should hold an 
 evidentiary hearing. 
 CONCLUSION 
 For these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (1) suppress all 
 evidence the Government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived 
 therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions and all evidence derived 
 therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this 
 Motion.

 Just want to put an issue on your radar. As you may recall, we paid a vendor to scan the SDFL Epstein file in October, and 
 we are hopeful that it will be loaded into Relativity by the end of March (the delay was unfortunate, but we're hopeful 
 PAE can make it happen soon). In order to meet pretrial disclosure deadlines, we need to review the file (which we 
 understand to be 30k documents) to determine what has already been produced. We have recruited 4 paralegals and an 
 intern in PC to help conduct this review, and have requested an additional 3-4 paralegals from Darcy to assist. The 
 deadline is the end of April, so the team has about a month to complete the review. 
 Happy to discuss any further if you have any questions.

 There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place 
 in 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. 
 It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors will 
 do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine Maxwell 
 sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her accountable. 
 will open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
 Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
 Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a

 Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and 
 opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

 Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
 reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
 you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
 made for any students at Interlochen? 
 Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow

 Good morning-
 The melding of our respective questionnaires has posed difficulties. 
 For purposes of today's conferral, attached is your version of the questionnaire with slight edits in track change. 
 Also attached is draft of our (far more robust) proposed questionnaire in Word (formatting to be corrected.) 
 Our proposed questionnaire incorporates portions of your proposed voir dire, which would be redundant if 
 covered by a written questionnaire. 
 We are working on a more inclusive version of proposed voir dire questions for this afternoon's conferral.

 Hi 
 We'd like someone to sign an affidavit for now, but we'd also like to identify someone who could testify at trial if need be. 
 The trial is for Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to start in New York in November. 
 I've attached a proposed declaration, though if FedEx has its own standard format, that will likely work too.

 Good afternoon, 
 p_.,usdoLgoi>
 I am writing because my trial which was supposed to begin today has been moved to March 3rd. I asked the Court 
 (EDNY) for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly 
 that there was a Curcio issue. That application was denied. 
 So, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from 
 our firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make 
 another request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than 
 address the Curcio issue. 
 Thank you.

 Have we gotten anything yet from JPMC? Any indication of why they ended their relationship with him in 2013? 
 As I'm sure you've seen, NYT has a piece up on the relationship which suggests executives at JPMC overruled compliance 
 efforts to kick him out back in 2008-09 but the article doesn't suggest any financial misconduct or even red flags in his 
 JPMC accounts, just the fact of his prior conviction.

 M, Mr. Epstein's family has asked me to send to you and Adam Johnson at the MCC a request for the preservation of any 
 and all documents, records, reports, videos, pictures, physical evidence, electronic communication data, tape recordings, 
 logs, notes, papers, emails and any and all other forms of information that would be in the possession of the MCC, its 
 Warden, their legal counsel, the USMS, the FBI, the Inspector General, the USAO for the SDNY or any other federal or 
 relevant state or city agency that relate to Jeffrey Epstein's imprisonment/detention since July 6, 2019 and that relate 
 particularly but not exclusively to the July 23, 2019 occurrence which was investigated as an attempted suicide by the 
 MCC and the events relating to his death on August 10, 2019. The request encompasses but is not limited to any videos of 
 the 9th floor area in the proximity of his cell during the evening of August 9 through the time Mr. Epstein was taken out of 
 his cell for the last time on August 10, 2019, or videos of the cell itself during that time period, records of the identities of 
 (i.e. MCC employees or independent contractors or anyone else) who were on duty from midnight through 8 AM on 
 August 10, 2019 or otherwise had access to the 9th floor unit where Mr. Epstein was incarcerated during this time period, 
 records of any observations of Mr. Epstein on August 9-10, 2019, any and all photographs of Mr. Epstein or his cell taken 
 on August 10, 2019, any and all electronic or tape recordings or records of any internal communications within the MCC or 
 any external communciations by MCC staff on August 9 and August 10, 2019, records of any mental health interviews or 
 assessements of Mr. Epstein at anytime during his detention, records of any decision to put him on or take Mr Epstein off 
 suicide watch, photos of his cell taken on or before August 9 or on or after August 10, 2019, memoranda of interviews with 
 any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23 or on August 9-10, 2019 relating to 
 Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC employee or independent contractor or any other 
 person in the MCC midnight-8 AM August 10, 2019, any and all medical and EMS and hospital records from July 23 
 and/or August 10, 2019, and the future pathology and toxicology and medical examiner's reports. Additionally, we would 
 request the preservation of any note or notes found in Mr. Epstein's cell on August 10, 2019, any ligature or other physical 
 evidence related to his cause of death, any bedding, any medication or vitamins, any log showing who entered or were 
 present in the MCC for the 12 hour period before 6:30 AM on August 10, 2019, as well as a list of inmates who were in Mr. 
 Epstein's unit during the evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10, 2019. We would in addition to the 
 preservation request ask for the production of all of the above. We would receive and retain in subject any information 
 received in response to this request subject to the terms and conditions of our Protective Order. In short, the family requests 
 a preservation and production of any and all records and documents relevant to his detention, treatment, and death. I will 
 send an identical request to Mr Johnson (as well as to Mark Epstein's personal counsel 
 Thank you for your consideration of these requests and your ongoing assistance

I just wanted to let you know that I don't expect we'll have any further updates today, and so wanted to send you a brief 
 note to let you know that since we hadn't otherwise been in touch since earlier this afternoon. I imagine we will continue to 
 be in contact in the coming days; meanwhile, I appreciate you being in touch today, and I hope the investigations of these 
 events will be thorough and swift.

 Following up on the below, wanted to make sure the attached letter from the Warden immediately got to Mike as well (in 
 addition to Marty and Reid having been copied and emailed). As the letter indicates, there are now investigations ongoing, 
 including as initiated by the Attorney General himself. Separately, we have not received additional information on topics 
 such as the apparent cause of death, the status of observation of Mr. Epstein at the time, etc., but we will continue to be in 
 touch immediately if that changes.

 Mike, Marty, Reid, 
 Following up on my conversations with Mike and Marty this morning, and my discussion with Mike moments 
 ago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It represents 
 all the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get 
 additional information we will pass it along immediately. 
 Separately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are 
 accurate, and I fully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. 
 As always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful.

 in first if the emails regarding Mr. Epstein's death and our preservation/production requests on behalf of his family 
 should be sent to another prosecutor (Mike Miller had the name of but not the full name) please advise. We would 
 ask you to confirm the request sent to you yesterday has been forwarded. We also request that DNA be lifted from the 
 ligatures and/or bed stripping found in Mr Epstein's MCC cell on August 10, 2019. 
 Separately, since the attorney client privilege survives death, we are still requesting a taint review in the event any review 
 at all of his emails from the seizures at Teterboro on Aug 6 or from his NYC residence are to be undertaken. If you provide 
 me with the name of the taint attorney when selected, I will provide a list of attorneys. 
 Lastly, is it the Government's intention to move to dismiss the Indictment against Mr. Epstein and if so will that occur 
 today?

 Hi Audrey, 
 Attorney 
 The Maxwell team would like to send the attached "friendly subpoena" to attorney 
 During our interviews in Florida, informed me that he has a copy of the settlement agreement between and 
 Epstein, which resolved 2009 civil suit against Epstein. MI is willing to provide us with a copy of the 
 agreement, but he indicated that he believes he needs a subpoena before he can do so. His firm has already provided us 
 with copies of all other court filings and deposition transcripts from the civil case voluntarily. The settlement agreement 
 resolving the case is relevant to our ongoing investigation into Maxwell's participation in the abuse of and other 
 underage girls.

 Date: Wed, 10 Mar 2021 21:12:55 +0000 
 Just FYI, got another call from Ms. this afternoon, looking for e follow-up. We did not discuss anything

 Subject: Epstein victim call 
 Team, I just received I call on my desk line from I woman named =MI, who identified herself as i former 
 client of and said she was i former victim of Jeffrey Epstein. I asked if her attorney had been in touch with 
 either the prosecutors or the case agents, since we had previously contacted him, and she said she believed he had not 
 been. She said she had been in touch with an NYPD detective but had not heard back in some time. She said 
 represented her for purposes of the Victim Fund, but was not currently representing her. She provided her cell phone as 
 She did not provide any substantive information on the call, and I did not ask for any. I advised that 
 someone would follow up with her, hopefully in the next week or so. The call lasted less than three minutes. 
 For context, we were in touch with Mr. several times in 2020 when he claimed to represent at least nine Epstein 
 victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing to speak

 Hi=, 
 We just received the below and attached regarding discovery in the Maxwell case. Many of these questions relate to

 Laura Menninger >; Bobbi Sternheim 
 and a — 
 We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
 call to discuss. 
 1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
 (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
 not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
 2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
 must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
 on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
 advise which way you would like to proceed. 
 3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
 the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
 missing attachments, if they exist. 
 4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
 by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
 afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
 "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
 provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
 These fall into the following buckets: 
 a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
 "date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
 seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 EFTA00019093
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
 were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
 reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
 files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
 intentional or are we missing those documents? 
 Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

 1. This case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation of a young girl by 
 notorious pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). It all started in 1994 
 when 13-year-old Jane Doe met Epstein and Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell ("Maxwell") at a 
 summer camp in Michigan. Jane Doe was their first known victim and was subsequently abused 
 by Epstein and Maxwell for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and 
 psychological trauma and distress. Despite that, Jane Doe has persevered and survived to tell her 
 story, to hold her perpetrators accountable and to seek justice for the atrocities committed against 
 her. 
 2. Throughout his life, Epstein systematically perpetrated acts of molestation. 
 exploitation, assault and rape on hundreds of young girls. Epstein's system of abuse was 
 facilitated in large part by his co-conspirator and accomplice, Maxwell, who helped supply him 
 with a steady stream of young and vulnerable girls—many of whom were fatherless, like Jane 
 Doe, and came from struggling families.

 3. This system, which took years to develop, all started with them exploiting and 
 abusing Jane Doe who they used as a guinea pig to refine their criminal enterprise and widen their 
 network of additional sexual abuse victims. 
 THE PARTIES 
 4. Plaintiff Jane Doe is a citizen of the State of California. At all times relevant to this 
 suit, Doe was a minor child living in Florida and New York and who was sexually abused while 
 she was a minor by Defendants in New York. 
 5. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in the State of New York. 
 6. Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the 
 Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
 7. Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the 
 Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 8. Plaintiff is domiciled in California. 
 9. Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin 
 Islands at the time of his death. As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
 Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The matter 
 in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000, and therefore jurisdiction in this Court is proper. 28 
 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(2). 
 10. Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in New York. 
 I I. A substantial part of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the 
 Southern District of New York, thus venue in this district is proper. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). 
 JURY DEMAND 
 12. Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all of her claims in this action. 
 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
 Epstein and Maxwell's Abuse of Doe 
 13. In the summer of 1994, Jane Doe met Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at 
 Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan when she was only 13-years-old. Doe was there as a student

 in the voice program. Doe was sitting alone on a bench between classes when Epstein and 
 Maxwell approached her. Epstein bragged to her about being a patron of the arts and giving 
 scholarships to talented young artists like Doe. Epstein and Maxwell probed her at length about 
 her background, family situation and where she lived. As Doe got up to leave, Epstein requested 
 her mother's phone number back in Florida. She was alarmed by his request, but also feared that 
 she could not refuse the older man's request so she complied and provided him with the phone 
 number. 
 14. Several weeks later, once Doe had returned from Michigan to Florida, Epstein 
 called Doe's home. Epstein first spoke with Doe's mother about how he mentors young kids and 
 provides scholarships for the arts. He requested to speak to Doe and invited her and her mother to 
 his mansion in Palm Beach. He sent a driver across town to pick them up. 
 15. Over the course of the next several months, Epstein and Maxwell attempted to 
 groom and mentor 13-year-old Jan Doe. Epstein gave himself the name of Doe's "godfather" 
 while Maxwell acted like an older sister to her. They took her to movies, went shopping with her 
 and lounged around Epstein's estate with her. Epstein and Maxwell then started to make sexual 
 references when they were with her. For instance, Maxwell told Doe that having sex with ex-
 boyfriends was easy because once you slept with them "they've been grandfathered in and you 
 could go back and fuck them whenever you wanted." Epstein also started to slowly display his 
 pedophilic ways when shopping with Doe and Maxwell. Instead of Doe picking out clothes she 
 wanted to wear, Epstein insisted that she pick out and wear little children's cotton underwear. 
 Also, after nearly every visit with Epstein and Maxwell, Epstein sent Doe home with two or three 
 one -hundred -dollar bills to give her mother since "she's having a hard time and struggling as a 
 widow." 
 16. While these visits made Doe extremely uncomfortable, Epstein and Maxwell made 
 her feel she could not refuse them. During this time, Epstein started to pay for voice lessons for 
 Doe and insisted that Doe could not advance her career in any way without him. When Doe 
 expressed hesitation about spending time with Epstein and Maxwell or acquiescing to their 
 desires, Epstein and Maxwell would threaten Doe, and scold her for being "ungrateful".

 17. During one of Doe's encounters with Epstein, he took her to Mar-a-Lago where he 
 introduced her to its owner, Donald J. Trump. Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J. Trump, 
 Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, "This is a good one, right?" 
 Trump smiled and nodded in agreement. They both chuckled and Doe felt uncomfortable, but, at 
 the time, was too young to understand why. 
 18. Towards the end of 1994, Epstein invited Doe into his pool house, where he 
 grabbed her, put her on his lap and started masturbating. Epstein told her that was what to expect 
 from photographers who were soon going to be take modeling pictures of her. However, when 
 Doe was ultimately photographed by these professional photographers, they did no such thing.
 19. Over the next few years, the sexual abuse escalated. On a regular basis, Epstein 
 would digitally penetrate Doe, force Doe to perform sexual acts on him and apply vibrators on 
 different parts of Doe's body. The abuse occurred at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida, 
 Epstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in New York City, and Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. 
 When travelling to these places, Doe often flew with Epstein and Maxwell in Epstein's private jet. 
 20. In 1996, when Doe was 16-years-old, Epstein moved Doe to New York City. At 
 first, Epstein put Doe up in his apartment on 65th Street and 2nd Avenue. After a few months. 
 Epstein co-signed the lease for Doe and Doe's mother for an apartment. Additionally, Epstein paid 
 her tuition at a private high school in Manhattan as well. 
 21. Once Epstein had secured Doe in New York and made her and her family 
 completely dependent on him financially (including, for the roof over their heads), Epstein's abuse 
 of Doe continued to escalate. 
 22. In 1997, while at Epstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in the City of New 
 York, Epstein asked 17-year-old Doe if she had a boyfriend. Doe replied that she did not. Epstein 
 responded that when she did have a boyfriend she would want the sex to be "good" and that she 
 should "get it over with already," meaning lose her virginity. Despite Doe's resistance, Epstein 
 then pushed Doe down onto her stomach and raped her. From that point forward for several years 
 in New York, Epstein raped Doe on multiple occasions.

 23. During Doe's time in New York, Maxwell also regularly facilitated Epstein's abuse 
 of Doe and was frequently present when it occurred. 
 24. In 1999, Doe moved to Los Angeles to start a career. Upon moving to Los Angeles 
 and being physically away from Epstein and Maxwell, Doe finally felt like she could escape 
 Epstein's abuse and stopped returning his frequent calls where he would threaten and berate her for 
 not appreciating him. 
 25. Despite Doe's physical escape from Epstein and Maxwell, the years of abuse and 
 exploitation perpetrated against her by them cause her immeasurable pain and suffering every day. 
 Epstein's Death and Will 
 26. In July 2019, Epstein was indicted by the Unites States Attorney's Office for the 
 Southern District of New York. 
 27. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan 
 Correctional Center, where he was being held pending trial. Upon information and belief, New, 
 York City's medical examiner concluded Epstein died by suicide. 
 28. On August 15, 2019, Epstein's last will and testament (the "Will") was filed in the 
 Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
 29. The Will indicated that it was executed by Epstein on August 8, 2019 at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center. The Will was accompanied by affidavits from Darren K. 
 Indyke and Richard D. Kahn attesting to their "Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and 
 Appointment of Local Counsel." Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn also filed a Petition for Probate and for 
 Letters Testamentary in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
 30. The Will's first article directs Epstein's executors "to pay from my estate all 
 expenses of my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my 
 estate and all of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate." The Will further directs 
 that "after the payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST," Epstein "give[s] all of my 
 property, real and personal, wherever situated...to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust."

 31. On August 26, 2019, Defendant Darren K. Indyke filed a Certificate of Trust with 
 the Superior Court for the Virgin Islands, confirming that he and Defendant Richard D. Kahn are 
 the two Trustees of The 1953 Trust. 
 32. On September 6, 2019, Magistrate Judge Carolyn P. Hermon-Percell of the 
 Superior Court of the Virgin Islands ordered that Epstein's will be admitted to probate and 
 authorized Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn to administer the estate. 
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
 (Sexual Assault) 
 33. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
 if set forth fully herein. 
 34. On numerous occasions over several years, Epstein, with Maxwell's assistance, 
 made violent sexual demands on Plaintiff while placing his hands on her body in a position of 
 dominance and control and while touching Plaintiff in violent and invasive ways. 
 35. These demands, often made when young Plaintiff was alone with Epstein or with 
 only Epstein and Maxwell, were intended to frighten Plaintiff into submitting to his sexual 
 demands and placed Plaintiff in apprehension of harm. 
 36. This conduct caused Plaintiff serious and persistent harm and contributed to 
 injuries that Plaintiff continues to suffer. 
 37. This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g 
 (McKinney 2019), because it arises out of conduct perpetrated against Plaintiff when she was 
 under the age of 18 that constitutes a sexual offense as defined in Article One Hundred Thirty of 
 the New York Penal Law ("Article 130"). See N.Y. P.L. § 130.52; N.Y. P.L. § 130.55. 
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
 (Sexual Battery) 
 38. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as

 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
 (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) 
 44. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
 if set forth fully herein. 
 45. Epstein and Maxwell's campaign of sexual abuse against a teenaged Plaintiff was 
 extreme and outrageous conduct that shocks the conscience. 
 46. Epstein and Maxwell's serial sexual assaults, committed during the course of a 
 methodical plan of recruitment, enticement, and attack, inflicted severe pain and anguish upon 
 Plaintiff 
 47. Epstein and Maxwell directed this conduct at Plaintiff and knew that it would cause

 emotional distress and serious injuries to her mental health. 
 48. This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g 
 (McKinney 2019), because it arises out of conduct perpetrated against Plaintiff when she was 
 under the age of 18 that constitutes a sexual offense as defined in Article One Hundred Thirty of

 FYI, I am merely forwarding this email sent to me but directed to you. It isn't from a journalist, so far as I can tell, but 
 rather from an Epstein/Andrew/others conspiracy theorist. The gentleman is asking you to make a public statement 
 about Andrew and the investigation that addresses two points: 
 • "The first would be to make an unequivocal statement to the press that the Prince IS now a target of your 
 investigation due to his obfuscation and blatant stonewalling." 
 • "...this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General why he has dismissed the idea of 
 extradition out of hand?"

 FOR THE ATTENTION OF GEOFFREY BERMAN 
 Dear 
 May I offer my congratulations on the way in which your office has been handling the Prince Andrew 
 Affair this past week? 
 My thinking is that it must have been rather interesting, even for a grown man, to learn just how low 
 and dirty and 
 tricky the British can sink when push comes to shove? They make Roger Stone, he who still has a 
 Richard Nixon 
 tattoo on his back, look like an amateur don't they? 
 Everyone it the UK has hugely welcomed the news that an MLA has been sought with the Home 
 Office, and most 
 seem to be confident that Priti Patel dare not interfere by denying your request. The consensus 
 seems to be that 
 she would instantly destroy not only her career but also her life by acting to prevent someone who is 
 obviously 
 a child-abuser and paedophile from facing justice when the entire English-speaking world has branded 
 him a liar 
 after the car-crash interview. 
 However I am not so certain. Looking at the tactics they have employed this past week, of 
 trying to blame you 
 for all of Prince Andrew's ills when you are in the middle of trying to conduct a professional 
 investigation into 
 EFTA00019112
something as serious as child sex slavery; my thinking is that they are willing to use every 
 dirty trick in the book 
 to keep the pervert Prince out of the FBI's clutches. The UK Tory Party has always been 
 an instrument designed 
 primarily to maintain the status quo in this country, with priority always given to 
 perpetuation of the monarchy. 
 It would not be beyond the Eton/Westminster old boys to find some way of using Priti Patel 
 without her even 
 being aware of it. ( she's not all that bright ) Mark my words, this is what I expect will 
 happen next; and I am 
 a man who told the world that Jeffrey Epstein would never make it to trial barely 48 hours 
 before his life was ended. 
 So there are two things I am now hopeful you might do. The first would be to make an 
 unequivocal statement to 
 the press that the Prince IS now a target of your investigation due to his obfuscation and 
 blatant stonewalling. 
 Many are they on your side of the pond who have said, quite rightly, that an innocent man 
 does not deflect or hide. 
 And it is for this reason that everyone in Britain now feels that Prince Andrew really should 
 be extradited. The reaction 
 to the latest headline from the Sun newspaper has made this abundantly clear. Everyone 
 is saying that if he were 
 a Plumber or a Bus Driver he would be in handcuffs on a flight bound for New York right 
 now. So don't you think it 
 is high time, and this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General 
 why he has dismissed the idea of extradition out of hand? Is it not a slap in the face of 
 Democracy to accord Prince Andrew special privileges 
 simply because of his royal status? 
 What does General William Barr want the world to think? That perhaps there may be 
 people in high places in 
 America who are guilty along with Prince Andrew? And this after Donald Trump himself 
 was filmed next to their 
 close mutual friend Jeffrey Epstein yelling "oh yeah, she looks hot!". 
 Journalists all over the globe have been saying the whole world has been watching this 
 affair unfold as if they had 
 telescopic eyeballs. If the United States law system does not interrogate this wicked man 
 under oath very soon the 
 world will have to conclude that the American ruling class is controlled by Paedophiles in 
 exactly the same way as the 
 British ruling class. And that the kind of corruption we have seen in Hollywood which led to 
 the death of children like Heather O'Rourke is endemic throughout the higher echelons of 
 the entire Anglo/American establishment. 
 EFTA00019113
Is this what you want the world to think? Does your Attorney General want the world to 
 think that he must be 
 a child abuser as well? 
 You are now aware that the British Royal family are nothing but gangsters, every bit as 
 willing as were the Chicago 
 mob of the 1930's to silence anyone who becomes inconvenient. So please think about 
 this very carefully... 
 Supposing during the course of your investigation you uncover the inconvenient truth that 
 both Donald Trump and 
 your Attorney General ARE involved with the international paedophile network? and that 
 your own country truly is 
 being run by gangsters? 
 What then?

 Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell (02879-509) 
 Good morning-
 As a result of my email to you on Sunday and your intervention with the MDC, Ms. Maxwell is permitted use of 
 a mug for water and possession of commissary snacks in her isolation cell. 
 However, the information provided to you regarding moisture and temperature conflicts with our information. I 
 am told that moisture in her cell has degraded envelopes and paperwork and the temperature check was 
 conducted outside her cell. 
 I request that Ms. Maxwell be moved to an interior cell. This relocation would eliminate exposure to moisture 
 and cold air seeping through exterior concrete walls. Further, it would assist in safeguarding Ms. Maxwell from 
 impending cold temperatures and the detrimental effect of wind, rain and snow. 
 Your continued assistance is needed and greatly appreciated. 
 Thank you-

 I am not going to be present today. The purpose of the visit is just for Maxwell and her attorney to review the 
 contents of the laptop. Please proceed to the MDC visitor entrance, let the guard know you are from the FBI and 
 there for a visit with inmate Ghislaine Maxwell. They should then direct you to the visiting area. If there are 
 any issues, you can ask that they contact MDC legal counsel  who knows to expect you. 
 I'm cc'ing in case there are any other steps that the last pair of agents to handle this type of visit with

 Following up on our discussions, we wanted to send you a preliminary statement of facts, so that we can discuss 
 whether there might be room for agreement. Whenever you're ready to discuss, please let us know when you'd 
 like to schedule a call. 
 Please note that the language below isn't final from our perspective — we're happy to discuss any issues you see

 Following up on your questions about 18 U.S.C. § 1510, we wanted to let you know that it is our 
 understanding that Section 1510 requires proof that the defendant knew the relevant law enforcement 
 official was in fact a federal law enforcement official. See United States v. Escalera, 957 F.3d 122, 131 n.11 
 (2d Cir. 2020) (citing United States v. Grande, 620 F.2d 1026,1036-37 (4th Cir. 1980) ("We read this legislative 
 history to articulate a congressional intention that one may be found to have violated § 1510 only upon 
 proof beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, that the person who was intimidated, threatened, or harmed 
 was about to communicate information to another known by the accused to be a federal criminal 
 investigator.")). By contrast, as we have discussed, Section 1512(b)(3) has no such requirement. If you have a 
 different view of that issue or if there are any authorities you would like us to review, we'd be happy to look 
 more closely at the issue. 
 Please let us know if you have any questions, or if a call would be useful to discuss.

 See below for the update from PAE. The good news is that they're getting this back to us on a rolling basis, and it looks 
 like we'll have at least some of this stuff in time to produce it by 11/9. The bad news is it does not seem like we'll have all 
 of it by that date. It does seem like we'll have greater clarity by early next week. 
 I confess, I don't feel like I fully understand all of the steps in this process or why it takes as long as it does, but I'm happy 
 to go back to. with additional questions if that would be helpful. I'm also happy to ask that he set up a call with us and

 still being imaged. Then it gets marked. Then copied to us. I have spoken to He thinks it is not possible to

 Good afternoon-
 I write to request immediate assistance for Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 There are many conditions and restrictions placed upon her at the MDC 
 that are of great complaint, but of immediate concern are conditions within 
 Ms. Maxwell's isolation cell. 
 The combination of cold, moisture, and sewage stench have made confinement 
 in her cell unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable. 
 Her request for an extra blanket has been denied. 
 Her request for use of her day mug for water has been denied. 
 (She's been told to cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.) 
 Her request to keep a snack in her cell has been denied. 
 The moisture accumulating in her cell risks her health and the security 
 of her legal work. 
 You have known me and my reputation among your colleagues and the court. 
 Trust me when I way that in my 35 years of federal criminal practice, having represented 
 individuals charged and convicted of terrorism and capital murder, housed in 
 MCC's 10South and FCI Florence-ADMAX (facilities I have visited), I have never witnessed 
 such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight. 
 The mistreatment of Ghislaine Maxwell reflects negatively on your Office, the Court, 
 and the BOP. The Government as a whole can and needs to do better. 
 For today, we seek the bare minimum - a change of cell to a location that is safe 
 from the cold, moisture, and stench, and an extra blanket to keep her warm. 
 The rest will be left for another day. 
 Please assist. 
 Thank you-
 Bobbi

 I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
 Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
 years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

 Greetings Janey, grossly corrupt SEC et al. 
 The fraud on the SDNY courts perpetrated by the grossly corrupt SEC is staggering. Like me, Dan Kamensky 
 never had a chance going up against the Mogilevich Bag Man Milken flunkie degenerate crew. 
 Phat Leon Black: Apollo as I have previously stated: very high on the SEC/Dal "Do Not Investigate List". Milken's 
 "right hand man at Drexel". Black, his family/Apollo controlled the ONLY Epstein SEC disclosed money 
 EFTA00019148
laundering shell called Environmental Solutions World Wide (ESWW). 
 In 2002 the SEC brought a complaint against ESWW: Fraud. With money laundering flags too numerous to 
 count. But, in typical SEC Cover up mode: no AML complaint.

 So, Black, his family, and Apollo KNEW ESWW was an OTCM money laundering shell when it "invested" along

 The SEC kept ESWW up and running for 13 years AFTER it filed its complaint while Black/his

 even revoked. Rather: voluntarily withdrawn.

 One of these things is not like the others: Dan Kamensky is NOT on the Milken et al SECIDoJ "Do not

 degenerates. ESWW: a money laundering OTCM shell. Leon Black? His family? Apollo? Epstein? Yes SDNY 
 and grossly corrupt SEC: Junk is junk. Milken is the nexus of ALL of it. Obviously, Pm not in the inner circle 
 either Mr Kamensky. I blew the whistle on a massive, SEC facilitated fraud on the public that is very much 
 ongoing. The SEC has KNOWINGLY used the SDNY courts to perpetuate this massive fraud prosecuting some 
 while corruptly and criminally obstructing prosecution of KNOWN criminals. AND screwing those who blow

 I think it's difficult to be that precise, just because we don't have great visibility into how many (and which) victims each 
 lawyer represents. That said, we have consistently put every victims we're in touch with (including c/o their lawyers) into 
 the victim contact list, so I think the best and most accurate number would be the 39 from VNS. I can't recall anybody 
 who we spoke with who would have *not* been on the list at that time, though entirely possible that we were in touch 
 with additional victims through counsel—we spoke to Brad Edwards, Robert Josefsberg, Robbie Kaplan, and Boies Schiller, 
 all of whom have multiple victim clients, some of whom we don't know the identities of.

 sent out 39 notices to all the victims listed in VNS. One woman wanted to come and missed her flight the evening before 
 the hearing. I arranged another flight a 6:00AM the morning of the hearing and had a car waiting for her. She missed that 
 flight too. I believe she was either Brad Edwards client or Singrid McCally. I don't remember her name but can get it she 
 was a no show. Anyone that called and wanted to come was given a round trip ticket car service to and from the airport 
 and hotel.

 For the first question, the AUSAs contacted the attorneys we were aware of who represented victims to tell them that 
 their clients were welcome to attend and to make a statement. I believe also sent out notifications, and hopefully 
 she can tell us how many she sent.

 Good morning, I wanted to follow-up with you to let you know that we have not been able to find any 
 information on the two individuals below. 
 I will tell you that the convention business in New Orleans is very busy. Our event is held here every year, but is 
 very small in comparison to many other meetings and conventions that are held here on a non-regular basis. If 
 there's a possibility that they could have attended another event that was in the city, you may want to contact the 
 New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau (www.neworleanscvb.com) to see what other events may have 
 occurred during that time. I do not know how far their records go back, but having worked in hotels in the city, I 
 know that they publish lists to its members of meetings taking place in the city. 
 Sony we couldn't be of more help.

For the second question, based on my review of the transcript (attached), a total of 17 victims were present at the hearing 
 and either spoke at the hearing or had someone read a statement for them. An additional 7 did not attend the hearing 
 but had someone else speak for them or read a statement from them. It is possible there were others present who were 
 not referenced on the record. 
 I don't think we can answer the third question. I don't recall anyone off the top of my head who wanted to attend but 
 was unable to, but it's possible there were some in that position.

 Importance: High 
 The Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of their issues is the 
 District Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to "have their day in court." The 
 Court's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has 
 alleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing 
 because they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY. 
 Can your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about 
 making a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim 
 impact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but 
 were unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing? 
 Please provide as much of this information as possible today. I'm very sorry for the quick turnaround but 
 the Department's response to the mandamus petition is due tomorrow.

 Hello Agent 
 IMPORTANT. I am writing a book and producing a documentary on a significant child trafficking case and understand you 
 have been assigned to this particular case. 
 Jeffrey Epstein will most likely leave the country (right after he completes house arrest on 7/21/10), for good. He does not 
 have to remain in the US since he does not NEED TO EVER work, or represent clients. He knows he CANNOT and has no 
 interest in soliciting new clients. He has made enough money ($2 billion assets according to last income tax return), to 
 personally manage his wealth and thereby save the 2% fee usually paid to an investment banker who manages large 
 portfolios. 
 Epstein will be free in 2 months and continue to damage vulnerable and underage girls in other countries. 
 He doesn't ever NEED to work. 
 Question: Why hasn't the FBI not contacted attorney Robert Josefsberg in Miami in order to speak with victim 
 in Australia? THIS IS STEP 1 if the FBI is truly interested in arresting him on child sex trafficking charges. 
 is Jane Doe 102 in case # 09-80656. She was trafficked and prostituted and now lives with her husband and 
 babyin Australia. He settled last year with her for pennies (in comparison to what he's worth), and she now has a gag order. 
 I is key witness since she was on his plane many times being paid to perform sexual activities with heads of state, 
 leading businessmen, royalty, politicians and celebrities. 
 Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and if you have any questions you may reach me via email or telephone

 Hi I received a telephone message fro She has contacted us in the 
 past an is currently making several calls to the FBI regarding Jeffrey Epstein. In her calls to the FBI, she claims 
 that she is doing a documentary and writing a book regarding human trafficking and about Epstein's use of a 
 modeling agency to assist him in trafficking underage girls into the United States to use in sexual conduct. 
 A few years ago, FBI tried to get documentation from her "source" regarding these allegations, but the "source" 
 didn't appear for interviews and never provided documentation. Sarnoff recently began calling FBI Miami to 
 again make these allegations. It is my understanding that FBI has told Samoff that if her "source" wants to come 
 forward with evidence and be interviewed, FBI is more than willing to listen, but Sarnoff is dissatisfied with that 
 response. 
 Obviously I haven't called ack, but I assume that she is calling us for the same reason. If so, can 
 you direct her to at t e BI?

 I confirmed with =hat Orlando until Monday. 
 st emailed me. She's been on sick leave for the past couple of days. She's feeling better and is scheduled to be on 
 annual leave until Tues for Father's Day plans. She said she could make it to the sentencing if you need her there. 
 I told her I'd relay this to you. 
 Thanks,

 Thank you for calling me today. I am confused about certain legal issues. When I ask erl  his 
 morning why Jeffrey Epstein was not charged with child sex trafficking given the 2000 TVPA federal laws, she 
 EFTA00019173
did not want to respond. It s an important question that merits a substantial answer. 
 In light of the arguments surrounding the case I would like to know: 
 I. Why was Jeffrey Epstein allowed to plead guilty to a single count of solicitation of minors to engage in 
 prostitution? 
 2. In light of the 5 trafficking offenses outlined on pages 1 & 2 of the NPA signed 10/29/07, why was Epstein 
 given a twelve (12) months and six (6) months in a county jail (he served only 13 months), for all charges 
 without adjudication or sentencing, and without probation or community control? 
 3. Unlike any other registered sex offender in the U.S. prison system today why didn't he serve time in a State 
 penitentiary? Why was Epstein placed in a solitary cell at the West Palm Beach Stockade and only part time? 
 Why was he allowed to go to "work" outside of prison for 13 months during the entire day? 
 4. Why didn't Epstein like all other registered sex offenders in the U.S. have an attached electronic monitor 
 during his house confinement? 
 5. Why was prosecution for the offenses deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida? 
 6. In the ADDENDUM to the NPA (7A-C), Epstein is given the right to select and approve independent third 
 party counselors for the victims. Why? 
 7.According to the NPA signed by MV there are 5 federal trafficking offenses. Why were they dismissed or 
 deferred? 
 8. Why is Epstein given the right to contest damages up to an amount agreed to between the victims and Epstein? 
 9. Esptein's signature on NPA "is not to be construed as an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver 
 of..." Please explain. Why? 
 10. What was the "gain time" Epstein earned during his period of incarceration? 
 11. Why would the NPA not be part of a public record? And why would the US have to provide notice to Epstein 
 before making disclosure under a FOIA request? 
 12. Why was the Federal Grand Jury investigation suspended? 
 13. Wh the the US a e not to institute an criminal ch es a ainst his co cons irators Ghislaine Maxwell, 
 n light of the evidence? 
 14. Why are the grand jury subpoenas going to be withdrawn at the completion of the terms of the NPA? given 
 that he is a registered sex offender and that most probably he will commit the crimes shortly after his release next 
 month (this assumption based on empirical and medical data obtained from registered sex offenders), there 
 seems to be no protection mechanism for the victims in place? 
 15. Why was JE allowed to choose the attorney's for the victims and put a cap on their restitution? 
 16. Why was the Federal investigation stopped by the USAG? 
 17. Why hasn't Epstein been rearrested given the 11+ parole violations reported to the parole board since his 
 home confinement including weekly trips to NY and helicpter ride to travel only 9 miles? 
 Sincerely, 
 EFTA00019174

 approach is best, but I leave that decision to USAFLS. We are happy to facilitate and participate in any phone meetings

 FYI: state authorities in New Mexico are moving forward with their own plans with respect to the Epstein property. 
 Yesterday the state land commissioner revoked leases held by Cypress Inc. 
 https://www.abqjournal.com/1362185/land-commissioner-voids-epsteins-nm-grazing-leases.html 
 The linked news coverage quotes the New Mexico Attorney General as saying that he is conducting a criminal 
 investigation at the state level "in coordination with" the SDNY. Here are a few sentences from late in the article: 
 EFTA00019190
The [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land 
 Commissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General 
 Hector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased 
 by Epstein "because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given 
 us the perfect reason." 
 Balderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was "taking back lands that should be 
 managed to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children." Public schools are one 
 beneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: "We continue to investigate this matter at the state level 
 in coordination with U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."

 Hi, 
 I hope you both are well! Do you happen to know if saved her emails on the trafficking share drive? I 
 have poked around and couldn't find them and had suggested I check with you on the handoff (I thought you 
 both stepped into the role when she left, but let me know if I'm wrong).

 Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
 We expect to ask Mr. about his interactions with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
 employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for 
 an approximate timeline of when Mr. met and interacted with the nature of those interactions, and any 
 interactions may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. knowledge).

 Dear 
 Enclosed is a laptop for Ghislaine Maxwell, an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention 
 Center. We are providing this laptop to Ms. Maxwell for the sole purpose of reviewing discovery 
 materials in connection with the above-captioned case. The laptop has been reviewed by support 
 staff at our Office, who have informed us that they have successfully modified the laptop to meet 
 the specifications you have requested. In particular, we have been informed that: 
 • The laptop contains a microphone and camera, which have both been disabled. As a result, 
 the laptop has no recording capabilities. 
 • The laptop does not contain any programs for games. 
 • Communication capabilities have been disabled. In particular, the laptop has no Wi-Fi, 
 Bluetooth, or Ethernet connection capabilities.

 There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place

 Lawsuit Claims Epstein Trafficked Girls in 
 Caribbean Until 2018 
 The attorney general of the Virgin Islands says Mr. Epstein and his associates used a database to 
 track victims as young as 11 years old. 
 EFTA00019223

 By Ali Watkins 
 Jan. 15, 2020Updated 2:41 p.m. ET 
 New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and 
 girls on his private Caribbean island, some as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of 
 his alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls 
 as young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, and 
 kept a computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the 
 lawsuit said. 
 The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise N. George, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, 
 broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have engaged. He had 
 been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in 
 New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005. 
 In August, Mr. Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being 
 held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prison guards had not checked 
 on him for hours on the night he died, and the circumstances surrounding his death are now the 
 subject of at least three federal investigations.
 In the weeks before Mr. Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal 
 charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in 
 Florida for solicitation. 
 The suit was filed against Mr. Epstein's estate and seeks the forfeiture of Little Saint James and Mr. 
 Epstein's second private island, Great Saint James, as well as the dissolution of numerous shell 
 EFTA00019224
companies he established in the territory that officials have said acted as fronts for his sex trafficking 
 enterprise. 
 As part of its policies, the government of the Virgin Islands could take any assets recovered from Mr. 
 Epstein's estate and consider disbursing them to women and girls who were victimized by him in the 
 region, Ms. George said. 
 The new accusations — which draw both from independent investigations by Ms. George's office and 
 court documents from cases across the country — argue that Mr. Epstein ran a decades-long sex 
 trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.

 CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS CHARGED WITH FALSIFYING RECORDS 
 ON AUGUST 9-10 AT THE METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER 
 Defendants Allegedly Created Records Falsely Attesting to Required Checks of Inmates the 
 Defendants Never Did in the Special Housing Unit on the Night Inmate Jeffrey Epstein 
 Committed Suicide 
 Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
 Michael Horowitz, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") Inspector General, and William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau 
 of Investigation ("FBI"), announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging federal 
 correctional officers TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS with making false records and 
 conspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful 
 functions of the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"), a Manhattan detention facility that 
 houses federal inmates. NOEL and THOMAS surrendered this morning. The case is assigned to 
 Southern District of New York U.S. District Judge 
 U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure 
 the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
 Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms 
 to hide their failures. These defendants will now be held accountable for their brazen attempt to 
 shirk their responsibilities and conceal their conduct." 
 DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said:

"Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint 
 James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here," Ms. George said. 
 The suit underscores the legal complications of reckoning with such wide-reaching crimes as those 
 Mr. Epstein is said to have committed. Ms. George's suit is the first filed against the estate by a 
 government entity, but it joins a field of similar claims filed by more than a dozen women. 
 It remains unclear how Mr. Epstein's assets, which are valued at about $500 million, could be 
 allocated. 
 "We don't have a long history of figuring out what to do in cases of human trafficking," said Bridgette 
 Can, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, who 
 consulted with Ms. George's team on the case. "I think this litigation and the courts are just trying to 
 come up with the best, imperfect solution." 
 Mr. Epstein's executor, Darren K. Indyke, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
 Ms. George said she believed the case could chip away at the region's reputation as a notorious haven 
 for the rich and powerful. 
 "We will not remain complacent, and we will enforce our laws whatever way we can," Ms. George 
 said. "It doesn't matter the social status of the person. It's that the laws apply equally."

 The court documents said that Mr. Epstein operated with impunity for years at Little Saint James 
 and Great Saint James, which he obtained through a straw purchaser in 2016. 
 As recently as July 2018, Mr. Epstein refused to permit an investigator from the Virgin Island's 
 Department of Justice to enter Little Saint James, claiming the island's dock was his "front door," 
 according to the lawsuit. The investigator was doing routine monitoring of Mr. Epstein because he 
 was a registered sex offender. 
 Mr. Epstein's victims included aspiring models from South America, according to court documents. 
 EFTA00019227
Mr. Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, 
 using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the 
 lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said. 
 The suit also said air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private 
 plane in 2018 with girls who looked as young as 11. 
 In one undated incident detailed in the lawsuit, a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's 
 island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was 
 found, and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said. 
 Prosecutors in New York have said their investigation has continued and anyone who helped Mr. 
 Epstein could face criminal charges.
 In addition, the lawsuit said, Mr. Epstein embarked on several illegal construction projects at Great 
 Saint James, which caused damage to native coral and wildlife.

 The more than a dozen women who have filed lawsuits against Mr. Epstein's estate in New York City 
 since his death have accused him of exploiting and sexually abusing them when they were young 
 women and girls, according to court documents. Many are seeking financial compensation. 
 The lawsuit in the Virgin Islands appears to be the first filed against the estate in that jurisdiction. 
 Mr. Epstein maintained his legal permanent residence — and his estate — there. He hastily filed his 
 will in a Virgin Islands court just days before he killed himself. 
 Ms. George's lawsuit also seeks to head off an effort by Mr. Epstein's executor, Mr. Indyke, to turn 
 Mr. Epstein's vast wealth into a victim's compensatory fund. Mr. Indyke's proposal, which is 
 currently being litigated in a separate Virgin Islands case, imposes confidentiality on any claimants, 
 Ms. George said. 
 "The estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the criminal activities of 
 the Epstein enterprise," the lawsuit said. 
 In a statement when that fund was first announced, Mr. Indyke said it would give victims "the 
 opportunity to obtain appropriate compensation and to be heard and treated with compassion, 
 dignity and respect."

 The BOP would like to convene a Board of Inquiry (relevant Program Statement attached) that would review operations 
 generally at MCC New York. Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, review

 We are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise connected to

 substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, 
 and moved around the common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to complete their 
 duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications attesting to having conducted 
 multiple counts of inmates that they did not do. As a result of those false statements, the MCC 
 believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored when, in fact, as a result of the 
 defendants' conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from 
 approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which 
 time, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of MCC inmate Jeffrey Epstein, who had 
 committed suicide while unobserved earlier that morning. 
 Background on Relevant Individuals & Entities 
 The MCC is a federal administrative detention facility located in Manhattan that is run by 
 the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The MCC employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is 
 to ensure the care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. NOEL has been 
 employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016, and THOMAS has 
 been employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. Both NOEL and 
 THOMAS were regularly assigned to work shifts in the SHU at the MCC. 
 Correctional officers assigned to guard inmates in the SHU — and throughout the MCC —
 are required to conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to 
 ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for within the MCC. Two officers are required to 
 complete the institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU, and are further 
 required to document their performance of the count on an official MCC form called a count slip. 
 In addition to the institutional count, MCC correctional officers assigned to the SHU are required 
 to complete rounds every thirty minutes to ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for 
 within his cell. Correctional officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form 
 documenting the date and time of each 30-minute round in each area of the SHU. 
 On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking 
 charges, and was subsequently assigned to the SHU due to risk factors for suicidality and safety 
 concerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, Epstein was transferred to suicide 
 watch and then psychological observation. Upon being moved back to the SHU on July 30, 
 2019, the MCC took steps to guard against future suicide attempts by Epstein, including by 
 assigning Epstein to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk. Conducting the required 
 institutional counts and thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's procedures 
 for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
 The Events of August 9-10, 2019 
 On August 9, 2019, NOEL was assigned to work in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9,

2019 to 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. THOMAS was assigned to work with NOEL in the SHU 
 from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. From 4 p.m. on August 9 to 8 a.m. on August 10, 
 the officers on duty in the SHU, including NOEL and THOMAS, were responsible for 
 conducting five institutional counts at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 9, and at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 
 and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL and THOMAS were also responsible for completing forms 
 attesting to the completion of each of those counts. In fact, NOEL, and then NOEL and 
 THOMAS, repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts in the SHU. Instead for substantial 
 portions of their 12-8 a.m. shifts, in particular, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed 
 the intemet, and moved around the common area of the SHU. During that time period, NOEL 
 and THOMAS were the only correctional officers assigned to the SHU. Aside from two other 
 officers who briefly visited the common area of the SHU, as confirmed by video surveillance, no 
 one else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds throughout the night, and no 
 one entered the area in which Epstein was housed. 
 To conceal their failure to complete their duties, NOEL signed false certifications 
 attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., and NOEL and THOMAS 
 signed false certifications attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 
 5 a.m. when, in truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result of those false 
 reports, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored and accounted 
 for when, in fact, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from 
 approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which 
 time, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of Epstein, who had committed suicide by 
 hanging himself earlier that morning while unobserved. 
 NOEL, 31, and THOMAS, 41, are each charged with one count of conspiring to defraud 
 the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the MCC, and 
 to make false records, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. NOEL is also 
 charged with five counts of making false records, and THOMAS is also charged with three 
 counts of making false records, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
 prison. 
 The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are 
 provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be

 Jeffrey Epstein's scandal of 
 secrecy points to a creeping rot 
 in the American justice system 
 When rich people are credibly accused of crimes, does the public have a right to 
 know? Should multimillionaires be allowed to silence their accusers with cash? 
 According to superlawyer David Boies, "dozens" of women who could give 
 testimony about being  sexually assaulted as  girls by mysterious financier Jeffrey 
 Epstein are silenced by settlements they reached with their alleged assailant. The 
 exact number is yet another secret in this least transparent of criminal cases. 
 "Three dozen or eight dozen, I don't know, but there are dozens," Boies told me 
 recently. He himself represents two alleged Epstein victims bound by "non-
 disclosure agreements" (NDAs). 
 Because Epstein can afford to buy silence, he may succeed in shuttering the 
 window of accountability pried open in a South Florida court back in February. 
 U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra ruled that federal prosecutors — led by the 
 EFTA00019249
current labor secretary, Alexander Acosta — broke the law by entering a secret 
 sweetheart deal to allow Epstein to serve a cushy sentence without facing evidence 
 that he assaulted more than 3o underage girls in Palm Beach. 
 That ruling may prove hollow, however, if the alleged victims are now gagged by 
 their settlements with Epstein. What a galling next chapter that would be in this 
 appalling story. 
 Epstein, whose enormous and unexplained wealth attracted a circle of friends that 
 included Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, actor Kevin Spacey and Britain's Prince 
 Andrew, travels from mansion to mansion while poor men accused of lesser 
 crimes rot in prison. 
 This scandal of secrecy points to a creeping rot in the American justice system. 
 Too many cases involving potential felonies are resolved through civil settlements 
 that include ironclad NDAs. Once the money changes hands, witnesses can no 
 longer testify to crimes; indeed, penalties for telling the truth after a settlement 
 often run to the millions of dollars — ruinous for most crime victims. It's a short 
 step removed from silencing witnesses with cement shoes. 
 "It is a classic case of rich man's justice," said Boies. Add the fact that wealthy 
 predators often target victims in financial need. That was allegedly Epstein's M.O. 
 as he sent recruiters into working-class neighborhoods in search of teenagers to 
 give him "massages." The rich exploit the poverty of their victims to extract 
 promises of silence — backed by the force of law because the NDAs are binding 
 contracts. 
 What's needed is a simple change to the law, Boies contends: "Simply say that 
 agreements to conceal evidence of a crime are not enforceable." 
 The Epstein case is particularly creepy but not unique. The #MeToo movement 
 has revealed the pernicious misuse of NDAs to enable crime. Powerful men such 
 as producer Harvey Weinstein  and television executive Leslie Moonves reportedly 
 made use of the agreements to hide evidence of sexual assault or harassment. This 
 secrecy in turn allowed offenders to target additional victims. 
 That's where the public interest comes in. Crime is not just a matter between an 
 offender and a victim; crime is also an offense against the public order. The public 
 EFTA00019250
has an important stake in punishing past crimes and preventing future offenses. 
 Purchased secrecy interferes with those aims. 
 Some attorneys say NDAs are the only protection the rich and famous have 
 against unfounded accusations. But that doesn't bear much scrutiny. A person 
 who might falsely claim to be a victim has more to fear from sunlight than from 
 secrecy. And anyone who pays hush money to cover up false allegations is only 
 encouraging more extortion. 
 I am beginning to worry that the fresh breeze of openness that appeared to be 
 blowing through the stink of the Epstein case might be smothered by secrecy. 
 Attorneys for Epstein's Palm Beach accusers are losing confidence that their 
 clients will ever tell their stories in court. 
 Meanwhile, a panel of appeals court judges in New York has gone silent in a 
 related matter. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein friend and 
 confidante, is battling to keep details of her settlement with an Epstein accuser 
 sealed from public view. In a March hearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
 2nd Circuit, Judge Jose A. Cabranes openly scoffed at Maxwell's attorney as he 
 argued for secrecy. Yet here we are on the cusp of summer, and the court has not 
 been heard from. When will a ray of sunshine pierce the cloud of money? 
 If anything good can come out of this miserable case, maybe this is it: Lawmakers 
 can seize this outrageous moment to outlaw the silencing of witnesses through 
 NDAs. The agreements have their place in civil matters, but not to mask evidence 
 of crimes. The legal system, meanwhile, can do the right thing. Open the Maxwell 
 fi les. Then launch a full-fledged investigation of Epstein's conduct in New York, 
 New Mexico and the Virgin Islands: places where the tainted South Florida 
 agreement cannot protect him.

 Re: Continued investigation into possible collaborators of Jeffrey Epstein 
 Dear 
 Thank you for speaking with myself and others from the New Mexico Office of the Attorney 
 General last week. Pursuant to our telephone conversation, this Office is providing the enclosed 
 materials related to the criminal investigation and potential prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein's 
 co-conspirators. The enclosed documents include police reports, recorded witness interviews, 
 correspondence amongst New Mexico State agencies, and documents related to Epstein's leasing 
 of New Mexico public lands. 
 As previously discussed, all conduct described in our investigation occurred prior to 2008, the 
 year New Mexico enacted its human-trafficking statute. See NMSA 1978, Sections 30-52-1 to 
 -2.1. Should you have any questions, require any law-enforcement assistance in New Mexico, or 
 become aware of any criminal charges implicating New Mexico law not barred by New 
 Mexico's statute of limitations, NMSA 1978, Section 30-1-8, I ask that you do not hesitate to 
 contact me directly. 
 Should further investigation reveal additional survivors of crimes occurring in New Mexico, 
 know that this Office intends to work in union with the United States Attorney for the District of 
 New Mexico to ensure that these brave survivors have the opportunity to see that justice is 
 achieved in a court of law. Again, please contact me personally if your investigation reveals 
 survivors of crimes occurring in New Mexico not mentioned in the provided investigative 
 materials.

p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
 which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
 of an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
 overnight while unobserved. 
 RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
 2. The MCC is a federal administrative detention 
 facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
 Prisons ("BOP"). The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
 house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
 Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. The MCC 
 employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the

 correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. As of 
 August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. On August 9, 
 2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
 SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
 August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. NOEL had also worked a regular 
 shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
 8 p.m.

 charges. 
 THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
 6. The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
 any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
 the MCC. The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
 are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
 their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
 The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
 that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
 remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
 (the "Control Center"), which is located on the first floor of the 
 MCC. Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
 door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have

keys while on duty. Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
 separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
 locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
 have keys while on duty. Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
 can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell 
 which is made of cement and metal - is accessed only through a 
 single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
 to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
 7. The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
 guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
 inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
 is alive and accounted for within the MCC (the "institutional 
 count") . On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
 at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an 
 institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
 of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
 basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two 
 officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
 housing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to 
 document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
 called a count slip. To perform the institutional count in the 
 SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
 each individual inmate.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 The only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure 
 Ms. Maxwell's appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put 
 before the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant 
 her release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond in the full 
 amount of their net worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has 
 proffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are 
 U.S. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have 
 pledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of 
 these proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm, 
 which was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, setting forth a statement of her 
 financial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not 
 challenge the report's findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to 
 give up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard 
 travel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the 
 initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate 
 --
 and there is no "significant contemporaneous documentary 
 evidence" that corroborates its case. 
 With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict 
 bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute 
 for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the 
 significant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot 
 be eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee 
 against all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 
 EFTA00019295
8. On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
 required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
 write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
 counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional 
 officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips ' 
 are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
 officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
 the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
 roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. Only after 
 all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
 numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
 roster, can the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or 
 completed. If a housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
 incomplete, then the institution cannot "clear" the count. 
 Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
 via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
 "bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
 inmate to the institution's inmate roster. Records of each 
 institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
 supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
 9. In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
 requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
 the tiers of the SHU - which is called a "round" - every thirty 
 5 
 EFTA00017919
892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable 
 assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released 
 unless there are "no conditions" that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed 
 package satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail. 
 ARGUMENT 
 I. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the 
 Testimony of Three Witnesses 
 In evaluating the strength of the government's case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on 
 the government's proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by 
 "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence." (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The 
 government now expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the 
 government's response that it has no "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence"—in 
 fact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell 
 is based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified, 
 concerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no 
 specificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged 
 incidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling. 
 The few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which 
 are the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein, 
 not Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that 
 (Gov. Mem. at 11 (emphasis added)). The 
 government further states that 
 (Id. 
 (emphasis added)). The strength of the government's case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue 
 2 
 EFTA00019296
here. Whether or not the accusers' recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to 
 the strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
 The only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal 
 value. The government references 
 ■ (Id. at 11). But even the government concedes that, at best, 
 It is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly "groomed" the accusers or 
 knowingly facilitated or participated in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors will come solely from 
 the testimony of the three accusers. The government's case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests 
 entirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses.2 Moreover, the substantive 
 counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-1. 
 It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense's assertion that it 
 did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death 
 of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact 
 I The government also proffers that they will have "additional witnesses." (Gov. Mem. at 11). But these are not 
 "outcry" witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers. 
 Instead, they will testify only that "both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims 
 when those victims were minors." (Id.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have "met and interacted with" 
 someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing. 
 2 One of the witnesses has submitted a letter to the Court. While the CV RA permits the right to be heard, the letter 
 should be given no legal weight in the Court's bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 33 I-
 32 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) 
 3 
 EFTA00019297
as a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.; The government's case is not what it represented 
 to the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.4
 II. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden 
 A. The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell's Substantial 
 Ties to the United States, Including Her Spouse-
 The government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new 
 information and that the Court was "already aware of the defendant's friends and family in 
 the United States. (Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail 
 hearing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submitted a 
 detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years 
 and the important role she has played, and continues to play, 
 It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of 
 whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk, 
 to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of support. This information, which 
 was not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's 
 strong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail. 
 Rather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance 
 of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial 
 Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step 
 forward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (Id. at 13-14). The government is entirely 
 3 
 Moreover, the government failure to requesill.MMI regardless of whether it was legally obligated to 
 do so. shows that the government has accept e accusers accounts without serious scrutiny. Given the 
 ovenunent's ongoing Brach• obligations, it is unsettling that the government would simply acc 
 4 Contrary to the government's assertion. the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment.

 discovery. We will be making those arguments to the Court in our pretrial motions to be filed next month. 
 4 
 EFTA00019298
mistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting 
 a divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to 
 protect him-from the terrible consequences of being associated with her. 
 Nevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing, 
 She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue 
 discussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any 
 reason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the 
 government has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's 
 relationship with her spouse is not a powerful tie to this country. 
 The government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship 
 with is particularly callous 
 and belied by the facts. (Gov. Mem. at 14). As her spouse explains, 
 (Ex. A ¶ 12). 
 B. Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of 
 Her and Her Spouse's Assets in Support of Her Bond 
 The government's attempts to rebut the financial condition report are unavailing. 
 Significantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the 
 voluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that 
 calls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for 
 the last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail. 
 Rather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms. 
 Maxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23). 
 5 
 EFTA00019299
The report shows nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was sitting in a jail cell at the time, 
 was asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best 
 estimate of the assets she held in her own name, which the government concedes she did 
 with remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.5
 The government's arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will 
 view at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the 
 government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated "sophistication in hiding her assets" 
 and characterizes her transfers to a trust as "funneling" assets to her spouse to "hide her true 
 wealth." (Id. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly 
 sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully 
 disclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets 
 disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are 
 included in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees. 
 The government further argues that the financial condition report shows that Ms. 
 Maxwell has access to millions of dollars of "unrestrained funds" that she could use to flee 
 the country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (Id. at 23). That 
 characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell 
 has procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property. 
 Second, the $4 million controlled by her spouse 
 could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty. 
 The government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future 
 contingent assets and income that may never materialize. (Id. at 23-24). For example,. 
 5 Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
 about her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview. 
 6 
 EFTA00019300
Similarly, the financial report does not include 
 a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical

 and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the 
 reference to is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of 
 But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package 
 with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of 
 their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell's wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It 
 is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial 
 consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The 
 proposed bail package does exactly that.°
 C. The Government's Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is "Adept" at Hiding and 
 Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious 
 The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had "an 
 expertise at remaining hidden," and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive. 
 6 The government's argument that her spouse's moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the 
 majority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (Id. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with, 
 all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her spouse will be 
 left with nothing. Furthermore, the government's assertion that they could not verify the spouse's financial 
 information because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (Id. at 24 n.9). The 
 defense provided the spouse's current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank. 
 7 
 EFTA00019301
(Gov. Mem. at 20). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing 
 a pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding 
 and somehow forecast Ms. Maxwell's intention to flee. (Id.). These arguments are just further 
 evidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible 
 light. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne 
 out of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats. 
 Moreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the 
 measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would 
 then willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she 
 remained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case. 
 D. Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly Unlikely 
 The government dismisses Ms. Maxwell's willingness to waive her extradition rights as 
 to France and the United Kingdom as "meaningless" because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee 
 with absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at 14). The 
 government misses the point: Ms. Maxwell's willingness to do everything she can to eliminate 
 her ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment 
 to remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell's French and U.K. 
 experts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver 
 as part of any extradition request. 
 In an attempt to counter William Julie's expert report stating it is "highly unlikely" that 
 the French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the 
 government attaches a letter from the French Ministry of Justice ("MOJ") that references neither 
 Mr. Julie's report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal 
 Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But 
 8 
 EFTA00019302
as Mr. Julie's accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the 
 extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an 
 international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1). This rule is necessitated by the French 
 Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (Id.). 
 Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition 
 treaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (Id. at 3). 
 The government's reliance on a 2006 case—in which France refused to extradite a 
 French national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to how a French court 
 would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the 
 United States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (Id. at 2-3). Nor does it 
 undermine Mr. Julie's opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries 
 has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a 
 U.S. court, it is "highly unlikely" that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id. at 3). 
 The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell's U.K. extradition 
 expert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry's opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be "highly 
 unlikely" to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be 
 admissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government's representation 
 at the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be "extremely unlikely." (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at 
 ¶ 39). Mr. Perry's addendum opinion (attached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the 
 waiver would be "a highly relevant factor" in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of 
 extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. ¶ 3): 
 7 Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general "discretion to deny extradition" after a 
 court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of 
 exceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell's case. (Id. 4.5). 
 9 
 EFTA00019303
Finally, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country 
 other than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible 
 standard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). By the 
 government's reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail, 
 because there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they 
 had no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be 
 enforced. However, "Section 3142 does not seek ironclad guarantees." United States v. Chen, 
 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D. Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell's ties to France and 
 the United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 30 years—create a flight risk, her 
 extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.8
 E. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail 
 The government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell, 
 though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become 
 infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell's mouth, 
 which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive 
 cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that "[i]t 
 has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue." As the Court is well 
 aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be 
 discontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded. 
 CONCLUSION 
 For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
 release on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed. 
 8 Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France 
 of Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,

minutes ("30-minute rounds"). Like the institutional counts, 
 correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
 inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. Correctional 
 officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
 is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
 and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
 EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
 10. On July 6, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein was 
 arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On 
 July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
 things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
 to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
 11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
 SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
 on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
 MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
 responded to the incident. Epstein was subsequently transferred 
 out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. Inmates placed 
 on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
 of the MCC, and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
 member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
 12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
 twenty-four hours, and then was transferred to psychological

 Thanks for speaking with us yesterday. Below is the most current version of the statement of facts we 
 have discussed. We want to emphasize that this is not a plea offer or a proposal, but we are passing this 
 along since you've asked us to send you a draft that reflects our must recent discussions. This is not final 
 from our perspective, and this may change following our conversations with victims during the conferral 
 process. 
 We recognize and respect that you will need to speak with your client this week. However, we do not 
 want to delay notifying the victims, and, as we've discussed, we plan to issue a letter to the victims 
 notifying them that we are in plea negotiations. That letter will need to go out this week. From our 
 conversation, it sounds like you plan to meet with your client in the next few days, so let's plan to talk 
 mid -week. 
 Thanks, 
 Between approximately 2001 and 2013 worked for Jeffrey Epstein as a personal assistant. 
 has been evaluated by an expert psychologist who specializes in victims of sexual trauma, who 
 completed a report dated April 21, 2020 regarding experiences before, during, and after her 
 employment with Epstein. The parties agree that the contents of the expert's report may be considered 
 at sentencing, and the Government does not dispute that was herself a victim of sexual abuse by 
 Epstein, as discussed in the expert report. 
 During the period of her employment between approximately 2002 and 2005, as part of her duties to 
 schedule appointments at the direction of Epstein and Maxwell, scheduled hundreds of 
 appointments for women and girls, including dozens of minors, to massage Epstein. Over the course of 
 that several year period, Epstein received approximately two to three massages per day, and during 
 those massage appointments, Epstein sexually abused dozens of minor victims. The vast majority of the 
 massage appointments that scheduled took place at Epstein's residence in Palm Beach, Florida, 
 though some victims recall that arranged massages which took place at Epstein's residence in New 
 York, New York. has reported that she has no recollection of scheduling massages for anyone in 
 New York. did occasionally schedule massages to take place in Florida by phone while she was in 
 New York City. When was first hired, she used a directory provided to her by Epstein's previous 
 personal assistant and Ghislaine Maxwell to contact women and girls to massage Epstein. Over the 
 ensuing years, would add new names to the directory when directed to do so by Epstein or 
 Maxwell. 
 EFTA00019317
Through the process of arranging and facilitating massage appointments for Epstein, met dozens 
 of underage victims, who ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. For example, when minor victims arrived 
 for the appointments at Palm Beach, sometimes met them, walked them up to the massage room, 
 and set up the massage table for the appointment. After some of the appointments, paid minor 
 victims in cash. Epstein encouraged minor victims to bring other girls to massage him, which led to an 
 increasing number of victims coming to massage Epstein at his residences. 
 None of those victims told that they were underage. did know that some of those victims 
 did not have their own cars, and arranged for a driver to pick them up and take them to their 
 appointments with Epstein. Additionally, some of those victims told they could not attend certain 
 appointment times because they were attending school. Epstein also told that at least one of 
 those victims was studying for the SATs. 
 During some of the massage appointments with minor girls that scheduled, Epstein sexually 
 abused the minor girls by, among other things, 
 In addition, the Government would be prepared to prove that witnessed some of the 
 sexual abuse that occurred. In particular, one victim ("Victim-1") has informed law enforcement that 
 was present for and participated in one massage when Victim-1 was a minor, during which Epstein 
 touched Victim-l's Another victim ("Victim-2") has informed law enforcement that 
 walked in on one instance in which Victim-2, a minor, was Epstein. Another victim 
 ("Victim -3") has informed law enforcement that walked in when Victim-3 was a minor and was 
 in Epstein's massage room. has informed the U.S. Attorney's Office that she denies 
 participating in any of the incidents described by Victim-1, Victim-2, and Victim-3. 
 In or about 2005, learned that law enforcement was investigating Epstein for sex crimes involving 
 minors, arising from the massage appointments, some of which had scheduled. After learning 
 about the investigation into Epstein, at Epstein's direction, called multiple minor victims and 
 encouraged them to "help" Epstein and conveyed that Epstein would help them if they helped him. 
 encouraged them to talk to Epstein's investigator, offered that Epstein would pay for an attorney 
 for them, and, in one or two cases, offered financial incentives to victims. understood that 
 by asking her to make these calls, Epstein intended to dissuade the victims from speaking to law 
 enforcement, and by agreeing to make the calls and take these steps, she was aiding him in this 
 objective. Beginning in approximately 2006, multiple minor victims were interviewed by federal law 
 enforcement officers who were conducting a criminal investigation of Epstein and his associates for sex 
 trafficking of minors, among other federal offenses. During those interviews, minor victims reported to 
 federal agents that Epstein paid them for sexualized massages while they were underage girls, including 
 during massages that scheduled.

 In terms of other useful information, for all the cloak and dagger about who the executor was, it turns out it's his two 
 main lawyers, Indyke and Kahn, who handle virtually all of his business activities (and of whom we were already well 
 aware). It appears that those executors have the ability to deal with claims against the estate or its assets. 
 As for where his assets actually go, it all goes to the "acting Trustees of the 1953 Trust" — i.e., nobody is named herein.

 August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS

 TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
 conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
 9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and 
 the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
 paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed 
 herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
 in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
 17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were 
 responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
 SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
 makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
 Nonetheless; NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
 that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
 performed. In reliance on that falsified count slip, at 
 approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
 count.

 (Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely

 It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we 
 can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can

18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
 attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
 defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. NOEL 
 and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
 immediately thereafter. 
 19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
 locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA 
 NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
 the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from 
 the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
 Officer -2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. Nonetheless, NOEL 
 and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
 that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. In

 Per the below, Epstein's counsel has asked to have a pathologist at the autopsy (and whether it can be delayed 
 until they're able to arrange for that. Anyone I can point them toward on that issue?? This seems way outside 
 our lane but not sure who else they could ask. Thanks and sorry for the unusual question.

 — 
 Thanks for being available today and for getting the wheels turning for an investigation into how he died. 
 On a related note, we are hearing that Jeffrey's autopsy may occur tomorrow morning. We would like to 
 have a pathologist present for his autopsy and cannot line up someone on such short notice. Is there any 
 way to push the autopsy off until Tuesday to give us time to do that?

 According to Lt. who spoke with Lt. transferred the call to the warden 
 asked if he was required to have a cellmate: 
 o Discretionary matter; 
 o Epstein was supposed to have a cellmate at all time per the warden. 
 o When his cellmate was released, Epstein was in the attorney visiting area. 
 o As a general practice, prior to the shift, the officers are briefed. The people in the SHU were supposed to 
 be briefed down that Epstein was supposed to have a cellmate at all time. Officers have the authority to 
 move cellmates. Captain was supposed to brief the Lt. who is supposed to brief down to the officers. 
 Don't yet know whether the captain briefed the officers. 
 We asked for follow-up materials relating the cellmate policy and whether this direction was committed to 
 writing.

 approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
 21. Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
 and at approximately 12 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, 
 replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
 two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. NOEL and THOMAS 
 were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
 the SHU. As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video 
 surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
 count. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
 slip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely stated that the 
 institutional count had been performed. In reliance on that 
 falsified count slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control 
 Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
 22. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
 additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
 institutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the 
 MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
 perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. NOEL and THOMAS

at approximately 3:24 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
 cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
 23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
 duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
 TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
 of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
 approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
 and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
 affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
 24. During the night, instead of completing the 
 required counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
 defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
 SHU common area (as noted above, approximately 15 feet from 
 Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
 common area. For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
 THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
 asleep. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
 including to search the internet for furniture sales and benefit 
 websites. THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
 and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
 25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
 briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
 NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk,

 Possible Suicide Attempt 
 On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
 was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
 had attempted suicide and roceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
 t -shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
 Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red 
 with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
 to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
 hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
 being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
 staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
 inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
 watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
 edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
 first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
 attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
 action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
 "Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
 behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
 left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
 R
 who stated that inmate E stein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
 hone, Nicholas had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
 him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
 matter. 
 I photographed and spoke with inmate Tartaglione, Nicholas who stated 
 that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something ha his legs and 
 said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
 saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon fi....rier questioning, inmate Tartaglione ..sated that he sleeps on 
 the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
 sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
 remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
 sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
 stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
 Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
 handed him a copy of the Daily News. "Nick" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
 He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that Tartaglione mentioned that he'd 
 been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
 Tartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
 Tartaglione stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
 report it. I ), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
 the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
 seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
 the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
 that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
 thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
 in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
 were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
 noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
 that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
 Duty medical, Dr. was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
 medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
 of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
 witi ll U on the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLPI. 
 for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
 marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

 On July 23, 2019 at approximately 1:27, I, S.O.S responded to a body alarm on the 
 S ecial Housing Unit. While the 9-South officer was conducted rounds inmate Epstein, Jeffrey 
 was found in his cell with nd his neck and appeared to be unresponsive. 
 I assisted with taking inmate Epstein Mfrom his cell and putting him on a stretcher. 
 The inmate was taken to the second floor and placed on suicide watch, where he was monitored by 
 staff. Moments afterwards, inmate Epstein became responsive. While observing inmate Epstein 
 he sat u on the bed and began telling me that he think his Bunkie, Tartaglione, Nicholas 
 tried to kill him. Inmate Epstein also stated that his Bunkie also tried to extort 
 money from him and stated that if he didn't pay hint that he would beat him up. He stated that 
 this has been going on for a week. I asked inmate Epstein if he told staff about this and he told 
 me no, that he'd only told his lawyer. He went on to say that his Bunkie told him that if he beat 
 him up, because of his charges, the officers would not report it and because of this he was not 
 comfortable telling the officers about the prolong threats and alleged attempts to extort him. I 
 immediately reported this to the lieutenant.

before leaving. At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
 officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. Aside from 
 those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
 else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
 throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
 was housed. 
 26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
 THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of 
 breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
 only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
 walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
 serve breakfast. At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was 
 activated in the SHU. Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
 responsive, with a noose around his neck. A supervisor who had 
 just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
 almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
 the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
 that "Epstein hung himself." After arriving in the SHU, 
 Supervisor -1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. NOEL told Supervisor-1 
 "we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." THOMAS stated, 
 "we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
 any rounds."

 Metropolitan Correctional Center 'accidentally released' serial bank robber days before Epstein's death 
 Fox News 
 By Nicole Darrah 
 8/15/19 
 A serial bank robber awaiting sentencing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was "accidentally 
 released" from federal custody just days before a series of ignored protocols gave Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity 
 for his apparent suicide. 
 Michael Matthews, 58, was told Aug 7 he was free to leave the New York facility which, in recent days, has come 
 under fire after Epstein, 66, died from an apparent suicide after being left alone in his cell for hours on Saturday —
 despite recently being on suicide watch, and despite protocol requiring otherwise. 
 Matthews' family told the New York Daily News that a counselor at MCC invited him to their office, where he was 
 given a card to ride the subway and paperwork to sign to be released. lie knew he was awaiting sentencing, 
 scheduled for Sept 20, but didn't speak up. 
 Richard Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, stated in a letter obtained by Fox News on 
 Thursday that Matthews — who previously served time for bank robbery — was released, despite being held 
 "pursuant to a permanent order of detention." 
 EFTA00019402
He explains that Matthews was arrested in January after he failed to appear at a halfway house in Brooklyn after 
 being released from a federal facility in New Jersey. He was charged with escaping custody, and was also charged in 
 three bank robberies during the time he was supposed to be in the halfway house, according to prosecutors. 
 "The government is currently seeking additional information about the circumstances prompting the defendant's 
 pre -sentencing release, and sets forth below those facts that the government has confirmed to date," Donoghue 
 wrote. 
 While Matthews surrendered to officials Aug 12, his release further contributes to the scrutiny surrounding the 
 MMC — which houses some of the highest-security inmates in the U.S. - following Epstein's death. 
 Attorney General William Barr vowed on Monday a full investigation into the federal prison. He said he was 
 "appalled... and frankly, angry to learn of MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner." 
 "We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough 
 investigation." 
 Epstein, who was found with bruising on his neck in his cell last month, had been taken off suicide watch shortly 
 before his death, according to a source familiar with the matter. Per protocol, the 66-year-old should've been 
 checked on every 30 minutes, but before his death had not been physically checked on for "several hours." 
 Additionally, he didn't have a cellmate on the night of his death. 
 A lawyer for one of Epstein's former cellmates, Nicholas Tartaglione, a former police officer in New York who 
 was charged in 2016 with the deaths of four men stemming from an alleged cocaine conspiracy, told Fox News 
 earlier this week he's had several clients who have been locked up both in New York City's notorious Rikers Island 
 jail and MCC, and claimed many have said they "would rather be at Bikers." 
 "That gives you some idea how bad the place is," the lawyer, Bruce Barket said. "At the end of the day, the facility 
 is run with a bad combination of laziness and cruelty and this is one of the results." 
 He described conditions at MCC "border on inhumane," and said one day, when Tartaglione woke up, he 
 discovered that while sleeping he'd rolled onto a rodent, smothering it. 
 Separately, a representative from the American Federation of Government Employees/Council of Prison Locals 
 decried the low staff levels at MCC, but also said the issue is a "system-wide crisis in our prison system."

 Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-CRIM-00490 (S.D.N.Y.) 
 Dear 
 We represent Jeffrey Epstein, Reg No. 76318-054, who was previously 
 incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York, New York (the "MCC") 
 while awaiting trial on federal charges in the above-captioned case. We have been 
 authorized by his estate to write pursuant to 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.21-16.26 to request 
 documents and records from the U.S. Department of Justice related to Mr. Epstein. 
 Specifically, we are seeking: any (i) protocols relating to the response 
 to/investigation of inmate deaths within the MCC; (2) video recordings of all entrances 
 and exits to the MCC; (3) entry and exit logs for the 
 MCC; (4) video recordings of the 
 hallways of the floor on which Mr. Epstein's cell was located; and (5) logs related to the 
 guards on duty at the MCC (collectively, the "Requested Evidence"). The applicable 
 time period for the requests is from 7:00 am on Friday, August 9, 2019 until 8:00 am on 
 Saturday, August lo, 2019. As required by the regulations, we set forth below a 
 summary of the relevance of the Requested Evidence. 
 Mr. Epstein died in federal custody in his cell at the MCC. We are troubled by the 
 circumstances of his death and by reports of irregularities at the facility. According to a 
 statement issued by the Federal Bureau of Prisons: 
 EFTA00019407
August 20, 2019 
 Page 2 
 On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:3o a.m., inmate Jeffrey 
 Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit 
 from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
 York, New York. Life-saving measures were initiated immediately by responding 
 staff. Staff requested emergency medical services (EMS) and life-saving efforts 
 continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local hospital for treatment 
 of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff. 
 The FBI is investigating the incident. 
 In a separate statement, Attorney General William P. Barr indicated that "Mr. Epstein's 
 death raises serious questions that must be answered." On August 12, Mr. Barr further 
 stated, "We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply 
 concerning and that demand a thorough investigation." 
 Moreover, there was initial uncertainty about the cause and manner of Mr. 
 Epstein's death. The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner ("OCME") 
 declined to immediately release a determination, citing the need for "further 
 information." Days later, the OCME announced that it had reached a conclusion 
 following a "careful review of all investigative information." 
 We intend to conduct our own investigation into the circumstances of Mr. 
 Epstein's death. In order to do so, we ask that the Requested Evidence be made 
 available to counsel. 
 Please let us know if you would like to discuss this request.

 Hi 
 See attached as requested for GX 742 and 743. I included all the pages in the attachments, those pages that you had 
 previously and the few new pages. I also included a current picture of the "Epstein Scholarship Lodge" on our campus 
 which was renamed "Green Lake Lodge". 
 Per my previous email, if you are also interested in the summer Camp 1997 application and highschool school year 1999-
 2000 application for the student in GX 742 just let me know and I can get those to you too. 
 Let me know if you have any follow up questions, thanks.

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Counsel: 
 The Government expects to offer testimony from Computer Forensic Examiner 
 of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ("FBI") Com uter Analysis Response Team 
 ("CART"). Although the Government believes that Examiner testimony will not require 
 admission through Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Government nevertheless 
 provides notice f Examiner anticipated testimony in an abundance of caution. A copy 
 of Examiner curriculum vitae is being produced to you today bearing Bates number 3503-
 001.' 
 The Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner will testify about 
 his extraction of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search warrants; user information 
 associated with certain of those devices; and documents and photographs extracted from certain 
 ' Examiner has previously testified regarding similar topics in federal court. As a courtesy, 
 the Government notifies you that Examiner has previously testified in federal court in 
 United States v. DiTomasso, 14 Cr. 160 (SAS), United States v. Hirst, 15 Cr. 643 (PKC), United 
 States v. Stash', 18 Cr. 259 (PKC), and United States v. Kelly, 19 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.). 
 EFTA00019459
Page 2 
 of those devices. The Government further anticipates that Examiner will also testify that 
 some of the devices on which he performed extractions were clones of device extractions that had 
 previously been performed by someone else. 
 The Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly 
 provide notice if the Government elects to do so. 
 Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice 
 The Government reiterates its April 23, 2021 request for reciprocal notice under Rule 
 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert witness that the 
 defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that the defendant 
 intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as the 
 witness's qualifications. 
 Additionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery 
 under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: 
 (1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
 copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which 
 the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or 
 reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in 
 connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, 
 and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which 
 were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. 
 The Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior 
 statements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975).

 PRESS GUIDANCE 
 Friday, November 26, 2021 
 *OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses will be testifying in 
 this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion (attached) requesting that they 
 be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, explicit and personal events 
 concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have been victims. I believe most, if not 
 all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and urge you to 
 abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy. 
 9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell — the defendant is charged in connection to conspiring 
 with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity — before Judge Alison Nathan

to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction." 
 DOJ OIG Special Agent in Charge Guido Modano said: "Correctional Officers swear an oath to carry out 
 their duties. Completing rounds to verify inmate counts and certifying the accuracy of logs are important tasks 
 to ensure the safety and security of institutions and the wellbeing of inmates. Those who shirk their duties but 
 falsely state they have completed them place the institution, fellow employees, inmates, and the public at risk." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Security protocols are in place to protect the public, 
 fellow officers and inmates being held in the MCC. We allege these officers falsified records to create the 
 appearance they were following those protocols. The security risks created by this type of behavior are 
 immense. The message here is simple - citizens place their trust in those who have taken an oath to serve and 
 protect the public, and when that trust is deliberately violated by public servants, who instead choose to break 
 those regulations, then they will be held accountable." 
 According to the Indictment[l I filed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 On August 10, 2019, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts of prisoners 
 under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, 
 NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, and moved around the common area of the SHU. 
 To conceal their failure to perform their duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
 attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates that they did not do. As a result of those false 
 statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored when, in fact, as a result of 
 the defendants' conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 
 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which time, NOEL and THOMAS 
 discovered the body of MCC inmate Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide overnight while unobserved. 
 Background on Relevant Individuals & Entities 
 The MCC is a federal administrative detention facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal 
 Bureau of prisons. The MCC employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the care, custody, 
 and control of the inmate population of the MCC. NOEL has been employed as a correctional officer at the 
 MCC since approximately 2016, and THOMAS has been employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since 
 approximately 2007. Both NOEL and THOMAS were regularly assigned to work shifts in the SHU at the 
 MCC. 
 Correctional officers assigned to guard inmates in the SHU — and throughout the MCC — are required to 
 conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate is alive and 
 accounted for within the MCC. Two officers are required to complete the institutional count for each housing 
 unit, including the SHU, and are further required to document their performance of the count on an official MCC 
 form called a count slip. In addition to the institutional count, MCC correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
 are required to complete rounds every thirty minutes to ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for within 
 his cell. Correctional officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form documenting the date and 
 time of each 30-minute round in each area of the SHU. 
 On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges, and was 
 subsequently assigned to the SHU due to risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns. After an apparent 
 suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. 
 Upon being moved back to the SHU on July 30, 2019, the MCC took steps to guard against future suicide 
 attempts by Epstein, including by assigning Epstein to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk. 
 Conducting the required institutional counts and thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's 
 procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein.

 Called 12/19/18 at 09:30, to advise that we had opened an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein because 
 represents multiple victims / plaintiffs, wanted to ask about other individuals who might be useful to speak with in the 
 initial stages of our investigation. 
 on the call 
 advised the following: 
 primary attorneys on the case are / were 
 o said also may work on it, in response to inquiry 
 also has worked with former Dal, and 
 believes there was significant misconduct in or in connection to New York 
 believes there has been possible obstruction / perjury conduct in connection with civil suits 
 best place to start is with victim attorneys, worth talking to 
 We requested that our inquiry remain generally confidential given the sensitivities of the investigation, including the 
 primarily covert nature of the investigation as well as a desire not to raise the hopes of victims at this early investigative 
 stage. 
 advised that he intended to honor the request to keep the investigation confidential, within the bounds 
 of collaborating attorneys 
 We agreed to speak again in the near future to arrange for subsequent discussions.

 Here is a draft letter to the Court. I'm going to send to the chiefs in 10 minutes so please let me know if you have any 
 edits. 
 Subject: RE: Meet and Confer 
 Judge Nathan agreed with us that sections of the deposition transcripts that appear unredacted in the publicly filed 
 indictment should still be redacted in your opposition because they were sealed in the defamation case. The redactions 
 we are proposing refer to those sections. So the fact that the language appears in the indictment does not mean it should 
 not be redacted. 
 That said, to move this along, we will preserve this objection and raise it with the Court at a later time, if we choose to. 
 However, we do ask that you redact "[Minor Victim-2]" at the bottom of page 134 so that it is consistent with the 
 redactions ordered by Judge Nathan on the top of the same page. 
 Thanks, 
 Chris 
 r 
 Chris, 
 We have confirmed that our proposed redactions to Exhibit 11 and those you circulated to Exhibit 11 are the same. As to 
 your newly proposed redactions, we understand that you are requesting that we redact portions of our brief that either 
 quote or generally refer to unredacted portions of your publicly filed opening brief (Dkt. 136 at pages 14 to 17) or 
 language contained in the publicly filed indictment. We don't understand why you are requesting that this language now 
 be sealed. Can you please explain your position? 
 EFTA00019474
Thanks, 
 Subject: RE: Meet and Confer 
 ■ 
 I believe we agree on the redactions to Exhibit 11. I have attached our proposed redacted version of Exhibit 11. I have 
 checked it against yours and I believe they track exactly, but maybe you could double check. We also agree that no 
 redactions to the cover letter are necessary. We also confirm that you should keep the redactions on pp. 118-119. 
 We also noticed that on pages 130-134 of the opposition brief there are a few quotations and other references to 
 testimony in the civil case that are still sealed. In light of Judge Nathan's order, we think those should be redacted as 
 well. We have attached the relevant pages. The additional redactions are noted in red boxes. 
 Please let me know if you want to discuss further. 
 Thanks, 
 Chris 
 Subject: RE: Meet and Confer 
 Chris, 
 Thanks for your email. In accordance with Judge Nathan's order, we are writing to confer regarding Exhibit 11 and your 
 cover letter dated March 9, 2021. Attached please find proposed redactions to Exhibit 11. We do not believe any 
 redactions are necessary to your cover letter. 
 We intend to the file the brief with the redactions as set forth in Judge Nathan's March 18, 2021 order, attached here for 
 your convenience. We note that the redactions contained on pages 118 to 119 redact quotations from and references to 
 a document that you filed under seal (Exhibit H). We understand that the quoted portions of that document are also 
 under seal on the civil docket before Judge Preska. Given those facts, we wanted to double check with you to see 
 whether you in fact want those redactions removed. We will defer to you on whether these should be redacted.

On August 9, 2019, NOEL was assigned to work in the SHU from 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019, to 8:00 
 a.m. on August 10, 2019. THOMAS was assigned to work with NOEL in the SHU from 12:00 a.m. until 8:00 
 a.m. on August 10, 2019. From 4:00 p.m. on August 9 to 8:00 a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the 
 SHU, including NOEL and THOMAS, were responsible for conducting five institutional counts at 4:00 p.m. and 
 10:00 p.m. on August 9, and at 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. on August 10. NOEL and THOMAS were 
 also responsible for completing forms attesting to the completion of each of those counts. In fact, NOEL, and 
 then NOEL and THOMAS, repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts in the SHU. Instead for substantial 
 portions of their 12:00-8:00 a.m. shifts, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, and moved 
 around the common area of the SHU. During that time period, NOEL and THOMAS were the only correctional 
 officers assigned to the SHU. Aside from two other officers who briefly visited the common area of the SHU, as 
 confirmed by video surveillance, no one else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
 throughout the night, and no one entered the area in which Epstein was housed. 
 To conceal their failure to complete their duties, NOEL signed false certifications attesting to having 
 conducted counts of inmates at 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., and NOEL and THOMAS signed false certifications 
 attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. when, in truth and in fact, 
 they never conducted such counts. As a result of those false reports, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
 were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, no correctional officer conducted any count or 
 round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
 which time, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of Epstein, who had committed suicide by hanging 
 himself earlier that morning while unobserved. 
 NOEL, 31, and THOMAS, 41, are each charged with one count of conspiring to defraud the United 
 States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the MCC, and to make false records, 
 which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. NOEL is also charged with five counts of making 
 false records, and THOMAS is also charged with three counts of making false records, each of which carries a 
 maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for 
 informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants would be determined by the judge. 
 Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the Office of the Inspector General, the FBI, 
 and the New York City Police Department. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rebekah 
 Donaleski and Nicolas Roos are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendants are presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 Hey= and 
 Here is correspondence (with attachments) about the OPR investigating. On December 10, 2010, I asked U.S. Attorney 
 Ferrer (S.D. Fla.) to investigate the "most suspicious criminal case I have ever encountered." That letter was forwarded to 
 OPR and, on May 6, 2011, OPR declined to investigate on grounds of ongoing litigation. 
 Note: We have seen a privilege log from S.D. Fla. that makes it appear that there was some correspondence between OPR 
 at Main Justice and S.D. Florida in connection with my letter. That correspondence was deemed "privileged" in some way, 
 so we've never seen it. But you should be able to get it. 
 Of course, as you know, in about January 2019, OPR did open an investigation into the case ... prompting my February 7, 
 2019 letter (attached) requesting that the victims be kept informed. I've received a response and we're going to set up a 
 conference call soon.

 Hi = — Just a heads up that the Maxwell team is going to seek your approval this morning to issue a friendly 
 subpoena to counsel for Minor Victim-4, the latest victim whose abuse gives rise to the superseder, for a non-privileged 
 materials related to her settlement with Epstein back in 2008 or thereabouts. As you can imagine, we think we need this 
 stuff both to prepare for trial but also as potential Giglio for the witness, and her lawyer is happy to provide it to us but 
 believes he needs a subpoena. 
 Happy to chat further if that would be helpful, but otherwise will have the team send you an email shortly so you can 
 approve.

 I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
 Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
 years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

 Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
 reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
 you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
 made for any students at Interlochen? 
 Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow

 Hope you're recovering well from yesterday! Whenever you have a moment, we were wondering if you could 
 take a look at the following: 
 Could you please send us provider information for the phone number listed in the SORNA registration? Looks 
 like the relevant number is 
 For the number, could you please run that through WhatsApp, and take screen shots of any account that 
 pops up associated with that number? 
 In addition, could you please run database searches on 301 E. 66th Street? This is the address for a property 
 that appears to be owned at least in part by Epstein, and where models for Mc2 may have been provided 
 housing.

We'd like to set up a Relativity database, please, for U.S. v. Epstein, and to grant access to AUSAs 
 Currently the only documents we need to have uploaded are in the following folder: 
 USvEpstein-awestigation FBI materials (reports FOIA 
 etc) 2018-12-04  FBI Case File 
 We'd like the PDF files in the folder uploaded but NOT the files in the subfolder (titled "Files combined and manifest"). 
 We also expect to be receiving a large amount of case files in the coming weeks, and so want to get up and running, 
 including agent access, so there's no delay once we receive the large batch of documents. 
 With respect to anticipate review process, it's possible that at some point we might receive materials that would 
 necessitate a privilege review, but not at this stage and not with respect to the materials in the linked folder. 
 Please let me know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks very much.

Department of Justice 
 Information Technology (IT) Security 
 Rules of Behavior (ROB) for General Users 
 Version 7.0 
 January 3, 2014 
 I. Introduction 
 The Rules of Behavior (ROB) for General Users pertain to the use, security, and acceptable level of risk 
 for Department of Justice (DOJ) systems. The rules highlight that taking personal responsibility for the 
 security of an information system and its data is an essential part of your job. As a user of the DOJ 
 Information Technology (IT) data and systems, you are the first line of defense in support of DOJ's IT 
 security. 
 The intent of the ROB is to acknowledge users' receipt and understanding of applicable IT security 
 requirements from various Federal and DOJ policies and procedures. These requirements include, but 
 are not limited to, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, OMB M-07-16, OMB 
 M-05-08, the Privacy Act of 1974, DOJ Order 2640.2 (series), DOJ Order 2740.1 (series), and the DOJ 
 IT Security Standard. 
 Who is covered by these rules? 
 These rules apply to all personnel (government employees and contractors) who perform general non-
 privileged duties on DOJ information systems, access or use DOJ information, or provide IT services 
 to DOJ — hereafter referred to as users. All users are required to review and provide signature or 
 electronic verification acknowledging compliance with these rules to their respective Component IT 
 Security representative. 
 Certain authorized personnel may obtain limited exemptions for specific occurrences when performing 
 official duties. These individuals must document situations where equipment and software limitations 
 listed below prevent mission operations. In addition to this ROB, the user shall also agree to and 
 provide signature or electronic verification acknowledging compliance for the Privileged User ROB. 
 The system Authorizing Official (AO) will issue an exemption if the accepted risk(s) and justification 
 is documented and appropriate'. 
 What are the penalties for noncompliance? 
 Non-compliance with requirements will be enforced through sanctions commensurate with the level of 
 infraction. Actions may include a verbal or written warning, temporary suspension of system access or 
 permanent revocation, reassignment to other duties, or termination, depending on the severity of the 
 violation. In addition, activities that lead to or cause disclosure of classified information may result in 
 criminal prosecution under the U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 798, and other applicable statutes. 
 Unauthorized browsing or inspection of Federal Taxpayer Information (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 
 7213A) is punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to one year imprisonment. Unauthorized 
 disclosure of Tax Return information (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 7213) is a felony punishable with a 
 fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison. In addition to these penalties, any Federal employee 
 convicted under Sec. 7213 or Sec.7213A will be dismissed from employment. 
 I For additional information on mobile device exemptions, please refer to the Department of Justice Mobile Device and Mobile 
 Application Security Policy Instruction v2 (http://dojnet.doj.gov0md/irm/itsecurity/documents/FINAL-
 D0J_Mobile_Device_and_Application_Security_Policy Instruction_v2.pdf).

 A. General 
 I. Comply with all Federal laws and Department and Component policies and requirements, 
 including DOJ Orders and Standards. Use DOJ information and information systems for lawful, 
 official use, and authorized purposes only. 
 2. Do not generate, download, store, copy, or transmit offensive or inappropriate information 
 in any medium, to include e-mail messages, documents, images, videos, and sound files. 
 3. Limit distribution of e-mail to only those with a "need to know." 
 4. Do not open e-mails from suspicious sources (e.g., people you don't recognize, know, or 
 normally communicate with) and do not visit untrusted or inappropriate websites (unless 
 authorized). Only download permissible files from known and reliable sources and use virus-
 checking procedures prior to file use. 
 5. Protect and safeguard all DOJ information, including personally identifiable information 
 (PII), commensurate with the sensitivity and value of the data at risk. Protect and safeguard 
 all DOJ information and information systems from unauthorized access, unauthorized or 
 inadvertent modification, disclosure, damage, destruction, loss, theft, denial of service, 
 improper sanitization, and improper use. 
 6. Verify that each computer-readable data extract containing sensitive PII data has been erased 
 within 90 days of origination or that its use is still required. 
 7. Upon discovery of a known or suspected security incident, report the incident to your Help Desk, 
 Incident Response Representative, Justice Security Operations Center, Security Manager, or 
 Supervisor. 
 8. Immediately report lost or stolen devices (e.g., laptop, phone, tablet, thumb drive) to your Help 
 Desk, Incident Response Representative, Justice Security Operations Center, Security Manager, 
 or Supervisor. 
 9. Encrypt all DOJ Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) data on authorized mobile computers, laptops, 
 tablets, and removable media (e.g., removable hard drives, thumb drives, and DVDs) using 
 Department -approved solutions unless a waiver or policy exemption exists. For classified 
 environments, follow the procedures required for those networks for data storage and transport.

 51. Do not print emails in public areas and with public non-GFE printers. Users may print with 
 non-GFE private printers at home. Users will be held responsible for the compromise of 
 Government information through negligence or a willful act. 
 52. Maintain a reasonable security posture (i.e., updated antivirus, local firewall, updated OS and 
 software patch levels) on registered non-GFE private computers used for remote access. 
 I. Traveling Users

 or an equivalent authorized SOC in advance, if you intend to travel to a foreign country with a 
 DOJ laptop that will accompany you during any portion of travel with the intended dates and 
 location(s) of travel. For travel to countries designated as high-risk counter-intelligence, the 
 use of mobile devices must be approved by the DOJ CISO prior to travel. Requests are 
 processed via email to both the DOJ ITSS Director and the DOJ ITSS Deputy Director.;
 54. Minimize the information on your IT system to what is required to perform a particular 
 mission while travelling and destroy copies of sensitive data when no longer needed. 
 55. Shut down IT devices when not in use or no longer needed. If the IT device is needed but not 
 the associated network capability, turn off/disable the network/wireless network functionality.4
 56. Assume all communications (including cellular services) are being intercepted and read when 
 on travel in a foreign country. 
 57. Keep your remote access token separate from the laptop/tablet (preferably on you) when 
 possible. 
 J. Personally Identifiable Information 
 58. Safeguard against breaches of information involving PII, which refers to information that can 
 be used alone or combined with other information that can distinguish or trace an individual's 
 identity —such as a name, social security number, biometric records, the date and place of 
 birth, mother's maiden name, etc. 
 59. Report all breaches of information involving PII to JSOC through your Component's standard 
 procedures.

 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00019537
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00019538
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00019546
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00019547
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

 Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to 
 transmit the scanned records to S but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we 
 last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials 
 you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was 
 included). 
 Another person on our team, who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via 
 phone her number is and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end. 
 thanks again!

 Hi 
 In connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks! 
 • Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day 
 • We do not need a conference room 
 • Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. 
 • Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. 
 • If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of 
 this if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. 
 Thanks a bunch.

 This is helpful and interesting, thanks very much for sending. Among other things, notable that Judge Failla assumes, even 
 were punitive damages to be excluded, a claim "for millions upon millions of dollars." 
 Separately, Robbie, I noticed near the end of the conference you mentioned, at p. 27, that: "They [the estate and/or the 
 trustees?1 have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein's brother." I'm wondering if you might have a recollection of 
 what the estate has said or represented to you about that? And if you recall whether any discussion of beneficiaries was 
 in connection with the will versus the trust versus the estate, etc. Just if you feel comfortable sharing any of that 
 information, of course—no obligation at all. And if it's more convenient to relay in real time, rather than drafting up an

 Okay M, I know the issue. The TDY needs to be changed to Santa Monica, CA instead of Los Angeles, CA since you're 
 actually staying in a hotel that's in Santa Monica, CA, which has a per diem of $248. Los Angeles, CA has a per diem of 
 $181 only. I'll make the amendments and resend your Travel Authorization to Budget ASAP.

 I've booked my travel in E2 — once again it's saying the hotel is over the per diem, but that's not correct (it's a dollar

 Roberta, 
 I wanted to let you know that Ken, Camille and I have prepared a Draft Protocol for the Program, setting forth 
 the proposed criteria and requirements for the evaluation of claims, and the claims process. As you know, the 
 establishment of the Program is still pending approval by the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, 
 we felt that it was important for us to move forward on the proposed design of the Program and to engage you 
 in the process as soon as possible. 
 To that end, we have attached a copy of the Draft Protocol, for your review and consideration. We welcome an 
 opportunity to meet with you to discuss any comments you may have. The comment period will run through 
 January 31, 2020. 
 Whenever you have a chance, please let us know if you are available to meet on any of the following dates: 
 December 18, January 6, 7, 8, 10, and 16. If none of those dates work, please provide alternate dates and 
 times, and we will try to coordinate schedules and set something up. 
 Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

 On behalf of Roberta Kaplan 
 Jordy, 
 Thank you for your email. We appreciate your commitment to a program that is independent of the Estate, which we also 
 view as a central feature of any viable alternative to litigation. As I'm sure you can understand, however, a claims 
 resolution program in which the three decision-makers were selected and hired by the Estate—and, we presume, are 
 being paid by the Estate—cannot be said to be independent. In our view, there is a straightforward solution to this 
 otherwise intractable problem: the program should add a fourth administrator, selected by plaintiffs, and require that all 
 claims decisions are rendered unanimously. 
 EFTA00019566
We look forward to discussing this proposal with you. We suggest arranging a time to do so before the protocol is 
 finalized, since it will be important to incorporate the input of an additional administrator into that process. We will, of 
 course, also raise this with the Estate.

 Thank you for your email. I hear your concerns and want to reiterate that this proposed Program is entirely voluntary and 
 independent of the Estate. It in no way imposes a process or outcome on the victims, and will in no way be administered 
 or controlled by the Estate. Those are signature features of the Program. 
 As I mentioned in my email last week, Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a claims protocol and plan to 
 circulate it - in draft form — to you and your counterparts before the holidays, and welcome any input you may have at 
 that time. We will provide ample time for you to review and respond to the draft protocol, and will be happy and 
 available to discuss your comments before the protocol is finalized. 
 We look forward to speaking with you.

 On behalf of Roberta Kaplan 
 Jordy, 
 EFTA00019567
Thank you for reaching out to us. We are writing back on behalf of (and copying) certain plaintiffs' counsel who 
 appeared at an SDNY conference last week for sexual abuse survivors of Epstein. We intend no disrespect to 
 you and your colleagues, but, candidly, we have serious concerns about the Estate's purported decision to 
 impose a non-binding settlement process on our clients unilaterally. All of these women still struggle today 
 because of the profound manipulation, objectification, and physical abuse to which Jeffrey Epstein subjected 
 each of them. Regardless of your own significant experience and good intentions, the fact that the Estate chose 
 an administrator without any participation, input, or consideration of our clients' views or wishes is 
 disconcerting, particularly given the personal nature of the claims at issue. 
 We are, of course, interested above all in advancing our clients' interests. As you may know, at a status 
 conference last week in the Southern District, Magistrate Judge Freeman instructed counsel for the Estate and 
 counsel for plaintiffs to engage in good faith discussions about any proposed claim resolution program. We 
 have already directed a request for information on the proposed program to Bennet Moskowitz, and look 
 forward to his response and to a productive dialogue with counsel ahead of the Jan. 10, 2019 deadline set by 
 the Magistrate for an update on the status of our negotiations. Assuming that our settlement discussions with 
 Defendants progress, we look forward to working with you at the appropriate time to design an effective and 
 appropriate settlement program.

 Roberta, 
 As you know, I will be serving as co-Designer, along with Ken Feinberg and Camille Biros, and Administrator of 
 the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation Program. I wanted to reach out to you to introduce myself, as I 
 understand that you represent victims who have asserted, or may assert, claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey 
 Epstein or his Estate. I also wanted to reinforce the key guiding principles of the Program and give you a sense 
 of timing in the near term. 
 This proposed Program is purely voluntary, non-adversarial and entirely independent of the Estate. The Estate 
 will have no authority whatsoever to interfere with the administration of the Program or the evaluation of 
 individual claims. 
 Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a proposed protocol - setting forth the proposed terms, 
 conditions, and criteria that will govern the Program - and plan to circulate a draft protocol before the end of 
 the year. We will be seeking your input at that time in whatever format you would like to provide it, through a 
 meeting with us and/or written comments, before the protocol is finalized. 
 We look forward to serving these deserving victims.

 This is helpful and interesting, thanks very much for sending. Among other things, notable that Judge Failla assumes, even 
 were punitive damages to be excluded, a claim "for millions upon millions of dollars." 
 Separately, Robbie, I noticed near the end of the conference you mentioned, at p. 27, that: "They [the estate and/or the 
 trustees?] have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein's brother." I'm wondering if you might have a recollection of 
 what the estate has said or represented to you about that? And if you recall whether any discussion of beneficiaries was 
 in connection with the will versus the trust versus the estate, etc. Just if you feel comfortable sharing any of that 
 information, of course—no obligation at all. And if it's more convenient to relay in real time, rather than drafting up an

 Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have 
 reason to believe Ms. has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions 
 with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with 
 that view. In your further discussions with Ms. in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general 
 nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns 
 about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I 
 believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to 
 further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely.

 Hi Jeff, 
 Thanks very much—I appreciate the heads up about scheduling, and that's not a problem, we can definitely work around 
 your schedule. With respect to notification, we have no objection to Interlochen notifying the students (who are now 
 adults) about the subpoena. As we discussed, we would otherwise request that you refrain from disclosing to third 
 parties. 
 Thanks, and hope you have a good weekend—

 Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
 office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
 In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
 parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct? 
 Thanks,

 I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
 Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
 years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

 Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
 reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
 you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
 made for any students at Interlochen? 
 Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
 and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues and (both cc'd) should be

Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
 contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
 we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload 
 those materials right away.

 Subject: RE: Discovery Issues 
 Chris, 
 We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
 let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
 responses: 
 1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
 the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
 the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
 Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
 legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
 2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
 new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
 if you would like to provide one for us. 
 3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
 similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
 recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
 each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
 showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
 5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
 SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
 CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
 EFTA00019596
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
 have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
 note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
 was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
 none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
 SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
 they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
 these images would not have CART numbers. 
 7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
 them.

 We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
 call to discuss. 
 1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
 (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
 not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
 2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
 must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
 on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
 advise which way you would like to proceed. 
 3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
 the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
 EFTA00019597
missing attachments, if they exist. 
 4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
 by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
 afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
 "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
 provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
 These fall into the following buckets: 
 a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
 "date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
 seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
 were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
 reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
 files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
 intentional or are we missing those documents? 
 Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Counsel: 
 We write in response to your March 8, 2021 letter, which requests the disclosure of: 
 (1) documents produced to Radar Online in the matter of Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 
 (PGG); (2) "any other FOIA requests that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation 
 of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell"; and (3) "any materials that reflect the involvement of 
 the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation." We address each request in turn 
 below. 
 First, you have requested that we produce to you all materials that were produced to Radar 
 Online pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") in connection with the civil lawsuit 
 Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG). As an initial matter, your letter fails to articulate any 
 legal basis for that request under Rule 16, or any other law governing criminal discovery. 
 Moreover, to the extent that you assert that you need to know when information received by Radar 
 Online through FOIA may have been published by the media, any information about the date of 
 publication would presumably be publicly available and, in any event, not information within the 
 Government's possession, custody or control. 
 EFTA00019599
Page 2 
 Notwithstanding the above, we have been informed by an attorney in the General Counsel's 
 Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that all materials produced pursuant to the FOIA 
 request made in connection with Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG) are publicly available 
 on the FBI's website: https://vault.fbi.gov. Furthermore, and without conceding any obligation to 
 do so, as a courtesy, we will provide you with the cover letters that accompanied the productions 
 to Radar Online. The Government is providing materials stamped with control numbers 
 SDNY GM 02743189 through SDNY_GM_02743292 under separate cover. 
 Second, you have requested that we search the files of the prosecution team' for "any other 
 FOIA requests that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation of Jeffrey Epstein or 
 Ghislaine Maxwell and produce to us the documents made public through the FOIA requests, the 
 dates the documents were produced and the identity of the recipient of the documents." Your letter 
 offers no legal basis for this request, and in the absence of further explanation for your request, we 
 see none. FOIA concerns public disclosure of agency records; it has no bearing on whether 
 information is subject to discovery in criminal or civil cases. See, e.g., NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & 
 Co., 421 U.S. 132, 143 n. 10 (1975) ("The Act is fundamentally designed to inform the public 
 about agency action and not to benefit private litigants."). In particular, to the extent this request 
 seeks the identity of any individual or entity who made a FOIA request, along with corresponding 
 information about how the Government acted on such a request, we are unaware of any basis in 
 law for such a request, and we invite you to point us to such authority. To the extent this request 
 seeks materials produced in response to any FOIA request pertaining to any investigation of 
 Epstein, we are similarly unaware of any basis in law for such a broad request. Our discovery 
 obligations are not governed by FOIA but instead by Rule 16 and rules applicable to criminal 
 discovery, all of which we have complied with and intend to continue complying with fully. 
 Accordingly, we are not producing materials in response to your request at this juncture. 
 Third, you have requested that the Government "produce any materials that reflect the 
 involvement of the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation." In response, the 
 Government is providing materials stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02743143 through 
 SDNY - GM r 02743188 in response to this request as a courtesy. This production should not be 
 taken to indicate that the Government believes it has any obligation, under Rule 16 or otherwise, 
 to do so; rather, we make this production as a courtesy in response to your request. 
 ' Your letter erroneously asserts that the FBI's Florida office is part of the prosecution team in this 
 case. We would direct you to our October 7, 2020 letter to the Court, in which we detailed the 
 entities that are part of this prosecution team. 
 EFTA00019600
Page 3 
 Finally, we have considered the concern you have raised regarding the language in our 
 October 7, 2020 letter and have filed a letter with the Court addressing the matter. 
 Very truly yours, 
 AUDREY STRAUSS

 Hey -
 That sounds good to me, thanks. I think it makes sense to discuss our theory of the case, both on the wbtw scheme and 
 on the possible PPE scam, just to make sure everyone is on the same page as we continue reviewing. In particular, now 
 that is openly taking a salary, we should discuss materiality—I don't think those issues are prohibitive at all, but it 
 might be helpful to make sure everyone is attuned to those issues as we review. 
 In terms of staffing, can we add M? I know he'd want to do it. Apologies that I haven't been working on this case since 
 we moved to remote work—I reviewed emails before we left the office, but haven't continued since then. In terms of 
 bandwidth, Epstein/Rikers stuff has been taking up my time, although I'm hopeful that will relent a bit over the summer 
 (or that someone up the chain will get tired of reading memos?). More immediately, I should be able to dig into email 
 review probably starting next weekish. Regardless, don't be shy about passing things off to me if you think of things we 
 should be doing that I'm not spotting.

 another warrant (either a refresh or some new accounts). is going to assign a GCer to do priv review, and I'm 
 continuing to hassle I=. about the iCloud returns. What's your bandwidth like? I know you're probably busy with 
 Epstein and Rikers stuff. We're getting close to doing a superseder in the Ukrainians case, but then I'm pretty free until my 
 currently scheduled trial in September (which I bet gets moved, but who knows). I think it may make sense to add a third 
 person to assist with email review and pushing this closer to charging. There are some people in our unit who are slow, 
 and/or GC is actually pretty slow except for compassionate release. On the other hand, fine to wait on this if you think we 
 should. Let me know.

 recorded these notes contemporaneously. appears to have held nothing back, and the notes certainly 
 paint a picture of the kind of troubled young women who were particularly susceptible to Epstein's pattern of 
 recruitment, grooming and victimization.

the facility. Each system, DVR system #1 and DVR system #2, contain sixteen (16) hard drives which recorded the 
 activity captured by the associated cameras. According to MCC staff, on 07/29/19, DVR system #2 had two to three 
 hard drives fail causing most of that system to stop recording. Two of the three camera feeds of obvious interest 
 resided on DVR system #2, meaning they were not recording at the time of the suicide on 08/10/19. Long before the 
 hard drive failures and the suicide of the subject, the MCC had contracted with NiceVision to replace the antiquated 
 system being utilized by the facility. NiceVision arrived at the MCC on Monday 08/12/19 to begin work on the 
 installation. NiceVision has not completed the work on the system because they have not had access to the equipment 
 room since FAVU arrived later that same day to export video from a camera feed on the working DVR system #1. 
 After consultation with NYO CART and OTD, it has been determined the best chance for the FBI to extract and 
 review video surveillance footage is to remove DVR system #2 immediately. 
 This system is currently being extracted with the permission of MCC Acting Warden A member of NY 
 CART will transport this system down to OTD today where a team from DFAS-DSAU will be waiting to receive and 
 attempt a rebuild of the failed hard drives. This will be necessary in order for us to reconstitute the system later when 
 we receive DVR system #1 at OTD. 
 Another team from FBI FAVU is currently on-site working on exporting video from the third camera of interest 
 connected to DVR system #1, which is currently operational and being utilized by the MCC. We will continue to 
 export video from this camera back through at least 07/23/19, the date of the first alleged suicide attempt. Review has 
 begun on this camera by C-19 and SDNY. At the same time C-19 will maintain a 24-7 presence in the equipment 
 room to ensure integrity of the system and to also allow access for simultaneous work by NiceVision to complete the 
 install of the new video surveillance system. NiceVision is currently once again working on the install and estimated a 
 completion of the work as early as tomorrow (8/15/19). Once the new system is operational and FAVU has completed 
 the download from the one known camera of interest residing on DVR system #1, we will collect it and send that 
 down to OTD. We anticipate we could send down DVR system #1 down within the next two days. This will 
 potentially allow us to reconstitute both systems down at OTD where we can determine what video is present. Then 
 we will review the entirety of the recorded video surveillance for evidentiary purposes. 
 It should be noted that the 30 day over-write in these systems were suspended for DVR system #1 and DVR system 
 #2 on 08/12/19 and 08/10/19, respectively. Also of note, beside the attempt to rebuild the failed hard drives, there is a 
 significant chance the hard drives pulled from DVR #2 on 08/10/19, are corrupted and/or encrypted since they were 
 extracted while the system was running. We will know more about this issue once we can reconstitute the system and 
 review. It is estimated the work described in this communication may take several weeks to complete. After all efforts 
 have been made the possibility exists the rebuild of the hard drives and reconstitution of the systems may ultimately 
 fail to produce the desired outcome.

 Southern District of New York 
 300 Quarropas Street 
 White Plains, NY 10601 
 Re: United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) 
 Dear Judge Karas: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court 
 regarding the defense's request for video footage from outside the defendant's cell at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on July 22 — July 23, 2019. On or about December 
 19, 2019, the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it had confirmed with MCC 
 staff that the requested video had been preserved, and that the Government was working to obtain 
 a copy from MCC. As set forth in greater detail below, the Government has learned that the MCC 
 inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within the MCC, and, as a result, video from 
 outside the defendant's cell on July 22 — 23, 2019 (Le. the requested video) no longer exists. 
 On or about July 23, 2019, at approximately 1:27 a.m., MCC corrections officers responded 
 to the cell ("Cell-1") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein. On or about July 25, 2019, 
 defense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendant's cell from 
 July 22, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. through July 23, 2019 at 4:00 a.m. From speaking with MCC legal 
 counsel, the Government understands that in response to this request, MCC legal counsel looked 
 up the defendant's cell number in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC 
 staff preserve video from outside of that cell for the requested time period. An MCC staff member 
 confirmed that the video had been preserved. 
 On or about January 3, 2020, the MCC provided the Government with a copy of the video 
 that it had preserved, which the Government then converted into a playable format. After 
 reviewing the video, it appeared to the Government that the footage contained on the preserved 
 video was for the correct date and time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was 
 located because the preserved video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the 
 cells seen on the video. After speaking with MCC legal counsel, the Government was informed 
 that the MCC computer system listed a different, incorrect cell for Tartaglione ("Cell-2"). 
 Therefore, when MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendant's cell be 
 preserved, the MCC preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1.

 The Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that there was a 
 backup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit, including the video 
 requested by defense counsel. The Government further understands from the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation that it has reviewed that backup system as part of an unrelated investigation and 
 determined that the requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at 
 least August 2019 as a result of technical errors. 
 The Government will make the video of the tier containing Cell-2 available for defense

 Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell update 
 Dear Nick 
 I hope this email finds you well. Since we last spoke, 
 I wanted to check a few things with you if I may on the Ghislaine Maxwell case: 
 1) Is it correct to say that there will now be TWO trials - the first on the child sex trafficking charges (covering the 
 period 1994-2004) and the second on the 2016 perjury charges? 
 2) Is the main trial still scheduled to start in November? 
 3) Is there any date set aside for the perjury trial? 
 4) What does this mean for the maximum sentence that Maxwell can now receive? I think we previously talked settled 
 on up to 80 years behind bars. 
 5) Is the investigation into Maxwell and Epstein's network still ongoing? 
 EFTA00019656
6) If so, does Prince Andrew remain a person of interest? Have US prosecutors managed to get a statement from him 
 yet or are there any arrangements in the pipeline to do so? 
 I'd be grateful if you could drop me line with some responses within the next 48 hours if at possible please. Many 
 thanks 
 All the best

 background: previously Epstein sued the lawyer, claiming that the lawyer was involved in an unrelated fraud that 
 the lawyer's law partner was convicted of-- the fraud related to an Epstein business. The lawyer is now suing 
 Epstein for malicious prosecution, claiming that he wrongfully filed the old lawsuit in retaliation for representing 
 Epstein's victims.

 Hi 
 I wanted to let you know that I just received a call froni, an attorney in Florida, who reached out to me to 
 say that he met with nd may be representing them in connection with our investigation and 
 possible civil litigation. I said that I could not discuss this further, gave him your contact information, and encouraged him 
 to reach out to you directly to sort this out. I just wanted to let you know because I expect he'll reach out to you. 
 If you have any questions for us or if a call would be helpful, please let us know.

 Thanks for checking in. Regarding the production format for the wire information, unless it's burdensome or the materials 
 are very voluminous, we'd like to receive both the Excel and PDF versions. Let us know, though, if that's an issue. For the 
 second question, why don't you produce the information as it's currently organized in the first instance, and we can get a 
 sense of the volume, structure, searchability, etc. If we then think it would be useful to receive the information by 
 account (which I think ordinarily is easiest for us, though may not be necessary here), we can circle back, if that all sounds 
 alright to you?

 We are preparing to produce account lists early next week. We have also started to receive certain wire information, but 
 wanted to discuss the format of that data with you before producing it. 
 First the wire information is available in two formats that contain identical information: PDF and Excel. For each 
 transaction, the PDF version has a two-page summary of date, amount, sender, recipient, and other related information. 
 The two-page summaries are compiled chronologically into a single multi-page PDF across all of the individual's accounts. 
 The Excel version includes all of the same information, but each transaction is reflected in a single row. The Excel format 
 is more easily accessible on our end, and we assume that it is more useful for you. Therefore, we would propose to 
 produce only the Excel version, but please let us know if you would like the PDF compilations as well. 
 EFTA00019689
Second the wire information is pulled by client name and is organized chronologically across all of that individual's 
 accounts. (Note that pulling by name also pulls in instances where the individual's name is mentioned only in the 
 payment details, even where the individual is neither sending nor receiving the money.) The account information for 
 sender and recipient is visible for each transaction, but because the account may be in the "Order," "Debit," or "Credit" 
 Party fields, it is not easily sortable by account number. In light of your request below, please let us know if you would like 
 us to organize the data by account before production. This will take a little work for the Excel format, but is feasible. 
 Given the volume of transactions, it would be incredibly time-consuming to reorganize the PDF compilations. 
 Happy to discuss further. 
 Thanks and have a great weekend,

 Thanks, and this all makes sense. We're happy to get wire information on a rolling basis, and other than that I think it 
 probably will be most efficient for us to receive the priority categories together (as to any individual account) unless there 
 will be a significant time lag due to any particular type of record, which we're happy to be in touch about as you get your 
 arms around the materials. And as always we can be in touch as the process progresses to refine the approach as useful.

 Thanks= We're aiming to provide a list of accounts (along with account types) for each of Epstein, S and 
 Maxwell by the end of this week or early next week. 
 We are prioritizing the collection of and Maxwell documents, and will also prioritize Butterfly Trust documents. 
 We will do our best to organize the documents in a way that's easily digestible and will certainly provide indices. As you 
 EFTA00019690
noted, some information may be available to us sooner (e.g., wire information) than others (e.g., account statements). 
 Assuming that you'd prefer that we provide information quickly, we'll plan to produce such account information on a 
 rolling basis, but we are happy to hold off until we have collected all of the priority categories — account statements, wire 
 records, account opening documents, and KYC materials — for a given account. Let us know your preference.

 Subject: RE: entities subpoenas 
 EXTERNAL SENDER 
 Anjan, Allison, 
 Following up on our discussion earlier this week, wanted to provide some additional information and to confirm some of 
 what we spoke about. We had talked about the likely usefulness of an index—or other description or list—of the number 
 and type of accounts that would be covered by the requests in each of the subpoenas; we certainly understand that may 
 take time, but do you have an estimate of approximately when that information would be available? 
 As we discussed, although the investigation continues to move forward quickly in all aspects, to the extent the pending 
 sub oenas are being processed in some serial order, the subpoenas relating to Ghislaine Maxwell and 
 dated August 16 and September 3, respectively, are more time-sensitive for us than the subpoenas relating 
 to Jeffrey Epstein, dated August 11. (Please note that there is a typo in the September 3 subpoena—in the "NAME" field, 
 the second name should say' rather than please let us know if we need to serve a 
 corrected version of the subpoena for your records.) 
 For the Maxwell and subpoenas, we are especially interested in incoming check and wire information, as well as 
 account statements, in the first instance. And as we also talked about, more generally we are prepared to receive 
 productions on a rolling basis, with account statements, wire records, account opening documents, and KYC materials 
 being prioritized in particular. And if you're able to keep us posted on the likely scope of responsive documents, we'll use 
 that information to further focus and target our requests. 
 In terms of logistics, I think I neglected to mention this on the phone, but wanted to also note that we sometimes receive 
 W
 ntity subpoena responses that are unusually disorganized—either not separated by account, or that only include 
 account statements and not other associated requested materials, or unaccompanied by an index or other way to discern 
 what materials are reflected in thousands or tens of thousands of pages in a production, etc. My recollection from prior 
 fights withMis that this is in significant part due to the fact that their records still need to be individually printed and 
 scanned for production (and that a fully-electronic review and production system, while in progress, is still a year or two 
 away). We're of course very heartened that these particular productions will go through you, which I imagine will 
 mitigate those issues, but we do want to formally request that any productions be organized by account, produced in 
 electronic format, and accompanied by indices linked to production numbers so we can make sense of what we receive. 
 Finally, with respect to areas of particular focus, we would like to request expedited production of any records relating to 
 accounts in the name of, or for the benefit of, "Butterfly Trust," in connection with the Epstein subpoenas. 
 Please let us know if any additional information would be useful, thanks again for talking with us last week, and we look 
 forward to being in touch again soon.

 Very good to hear from you, and I apologize for the delay in replying to your voicemail from Friday — I was on trial last 
 week so have spent the past couple days digging out from under piles of emails and voicemails. But we'd be happy 
 to speak with you regarding the subpoenas to the JPMorgan entities in connection with the Epstein investigation. 
 We had been in touch with Steve D'Allessandro, who was very helpful, but he also mentioned that they might bring 
 in outside counsel. 
 If you let us know a couple times that would work for you tomorrow or Friday—and I'm copying my colleagues 
 anc who are also working on the case—we'll get a quorum on our side and finalize a time. And please let 
 us know if any other information would be useful in the interim.

 He did, but is the one who spoke directly with him, so he can give you the most detail. (I took off this, so he

 Gloria just left me a vm— she said the client is a victim form the 90s and is willing to be interviewed on Wednesday. I 
 think she wants to know soon whether we want to do that, because it affects trial arrangements. I'll be on trial on 
 Wednesday, so defer to you as to whether that fits your schedules.

 Gloria, 
 We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by 
 the FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing who should be able to 
 hopefully help coordinate travel. Would you please provide with your new client's name as it appears on her

 Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either

 I have 2 questions. First, would it be o.k. with all of you if we did the call with =tomorrow at 4P.M. e.s.t as a 
 conference call rather than as a Skype call? We will be in at least 4 different locations and I think it will be easier if we 
 did it that way. If so, please send us the number to dial. Daniel from my co counsel Marianne Wang's office will also 
 be joining us on the call. Also ,re =, my client who is flying in for victim services will be happy to speak with you, 
 but I have a very tight schedule on Wednesday, because I need to be on a 1 or at the latest 2 P.M. train to D.C. that 
 day. Could we have the meeting from noon to 1P.M.? My office is only one block away from the FBI meeting.

 Gloria, 
 We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by 
 the FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing who should be able to 
 hopefully help coordinate travel. Would you please provide with your new client's name as it appears on her 
 ID, date of birth, email address, and phone number?

 What is the right way to handle this? It seems to be an offer by Guernsey's Auctioneers & Brokers to be retained to handle 
 the disposition of Epstein's property. I was assigned to respond to this. Please advise.

 The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer documents 
 than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, computers, hard 
 drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact processed and sent back 
 to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. My understanding was that 
 they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately 38 computers and/or electronic 
 storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs.

 We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our 
 investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate 
 both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we 
 were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in 
 the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, 
 and please let us know if any issues arise on your end.

 Inmate Death at the MCC New York 
 New York, NY: On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:30 a.m., inmate Jeffrey 
 Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent 
 suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Life-saving 
 measures were initiated immediately by responding staff. Staff requested emergency medical 
 services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local 
 hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital 
 staff. The FBI is investigating the incident. 
 Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under 
 pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. 
 MCC New York is an Administrative security facility that currently houses 763 male offenders 
 in New York, New York.

 Hey guys, 
 just wanted me to reach out to you guys, I interviewed the air traffic control guy Pat, and through a couple 
 phone calls, we believe that St. Thomas Jet Center (340-777-9177, Pat Hatch, employee) dealt with Epstein's 
 helicopter. I called over there to confirm and they said the company has no comment and will not confirm 
 anything regarding Epstein. Just wanted you guys to know in the event a subpoena was needed.

 Following up on the below, wanted to make sure the attached letter from the Warden immediately got to Mike as well (in 
 addition to Marty and Reid having been copied and emailed). As the letter indicates, there are now investigations 
 ongoing, including as initiated by the Attorney General himself. Separately, we have not received additional information 
 on topics such as the apparent cause of death, the status of observation of Mr. Epstein at the time, etc., but we will

 Following up on my conversations with Mike and Marty this morning, and my discussion with Mike moments 
 ago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It represents 
 all the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get 
 additional information we will pass it along immediately. 
 Separately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are

 As always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful.

 Will report that federal prosecutors and investigators are probing whether the two staffers guarding Jeffrey Epstein's unit 
 the night of his death falsified records that logged how often they were checking on him. 
 If the staffers are found to have falsified records, they could face criminal charges in the Southern District of New York.

 Subject: RE: Epstein suicide -- counseling for victims? 
 Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2019 19:21:38 +0000 
 With apologies for the weekend email, we have gotten questions from counsel about whether there is any availability for 
 crisis (or other immediate or near-term) counseling for victims, given Epstein's death? My sense is that some victims may 
 be struggling with the idea that their accusations could remain unvindicated as a result of these events. Is there any 
 information we might be able to pass along to them and/or their counsel? I'm also free to discuss via phone if that's 
 helpful I. Thank you very much!

 Hi Joe, 
 Hope the storm missed you this week, and that you and your client are doing okay. 
 Our team is working out some scheduling issues today, and we should know more by this afternoon. 
 I'll plan to reach out then to discuss scheduling, if that's okay. 
 Thanks,

 Just wanted to check in to see if you still planned to travel south given the storm. Current estimates

 (anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple jurisdictions, 
 and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is already set, and will 
 work around it. 
 Thanks,

 Thanks, much appreciated. If possible, it would be helpful to hold August 14th for a meeting, and we'll 
 follow up to firm up plans as we get closer. If there are any conflicts with that date, please let us know, 
 we're happy to be flexible.

 I do not have any travel plans during the month of August, nor does. September is a busy month 
 with two trials set, and I will be traveling out of the country from Sept 17-30, but I will do everything to 
 be as flexible as possible.

 Joe, 
 As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with we were wondering if you could 
 please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client for a 
 meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer vacation plans). 
 We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first instance it would 
 be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes. 
 Thanks,

 Hey 
 I'm not sure why we got sent these in this format, but could we ask you to please separate these dots out and save them 
 in the relevant folders? They can go in folders here: 
 Please save each interview notes with the format: YYYY-MM-DD, [First name Last name], interview notes 
 For anyone we already have folders for, the notes can be added to the existing ones; for anybody who we don't yet have 
 folders, please create new subfolders in that overall one. 
 And of course please let us know if any questions, issues, etc — and thank you!

 Safe Horizon has two people that WILL GIVE SUPPORT AND COUNSELING TO Epstein Victims. 
 Victoria Dexter (VP, Mental Health Treatment) and Sherri Papamihalis (Clinical Director — Counseling Center.) Our 
 Counseling Center has available slots, so perhaps you guys can all connect and see if that would be the right fit for the 
 victims in the Epstein case. Thanks! Sherri phone number is 718 9286914 
 I hope this helps. I know she is in Florida but thought if anyone else asks you this is a great resource.

PROFFER AGREEMENT 
 With respect to the meeting of ("Client") and his/her attorney, 
 Esq., with Assistant United States Attorney  to be held at the Office of the 
 United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York on [Meeting Date] ("the meeting"), 
 the following understandings exist: 
 (1) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
 provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
 may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
 Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
 into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
 Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
 in connection with this proffer. 
 (2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Office, except as provided below the 
 Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
 proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
 at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
 with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
 given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
 from justice. 
 (3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
 directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
 evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
 brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
 evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
 Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
 rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
 issues raised sua soonte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
 bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client. 
 (4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
 reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(0, United States 
 Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1(b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
 offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
 meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
 consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
 (5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence 
 any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the 
 United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other 
 federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of 
 this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects. 
 01.14.2019 
 EFTA00019831
(6) If this Office receives a request from another prosecutor's office for access to 
 information obtained pursuant to this Proffer Agreement, this Office may furnish such information 
 but will do so only on the condition that the requesting office honor the provisions of this 
 Agreement. 
 (7) It is further understood that this Agreement is limited to the statements made by Client 
 at the meeting and does not apply to any oral, written or recorded statements made by Client at 
 any other time. No understandings, promises, agreements and/or conditions have been entered 
 into with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in this Agreement and none will be 
 entered into unless in writing and signed by all parties. 
 (8) The understandings set forth in paragraphs l through 7 above extend to the continuation 
 of this meeting on the dates that appear below. 
 (9) Client and Attorney acknowledge that they have fully discussed and understand every 
 paragraph and clause in this Agreement and the consequences thereof.

 Just to clarify, I need different travel arrangements than those contained in email. I sent a separate email with 
 them, but I've copied the details below just in case: 
 I'd like to arrange the following travel, all with refundable tickets, please: 
 December 15, 2019 -11:40 AM Delta flight from JFK to LAX 
 December 16, 2019 — 4:15 PM United flight from LAX to IAD 
 December 17, 2019 — Amtrak 6:00 PM train from DC to NYC 
 I'd also like to book a room in the Double Tree Santa Monica for one night, checking in December 15, 2019 and checking 
 out December 16, 2019 in LA, please. No need for a hotel in DC, as I'll be staying with family. 
 We do not need a conference room for any portion of this trip. 
 Thank you!

 In connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks! 
 • Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day 
 • We do not need a conference room 
 • Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. 
 • Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. 
 • If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of 
 this if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. 
 Thanks a bunch.

 permission for the team to travel next week for an interview (or possibly interviews) in Los Angeles on December 16 
 and/or 17. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 15th to the 18th. Also similar to prior trips, 
 we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those days.

 Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
 three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
 down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
 Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
 be me and or and but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
 super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a

 Thanks for flagging. Let's produce in their original format to both for now. If Maxwell has trouble opening them at MDC, 
 we'll deal with that after she tells us she can't open them. She has not identified every single excel and txt file from past 
 productions as problematic, so she will hopefully be able to open these.

 How are we handling producing to Maxwell vs. Counsel? With these files there are tons of text and excel files that need to 
 be converted in order to be sent to MDC. Are we also producing the converted versions to defense or rather the original 
 natives?

 No way to put a confidential stamp on a excel file. There should be an image placeholder that says document produced in

 HIM, 
 You and the team there may have already seen this, but in view of the importance of the issue, I wanted to pass it along. 
 Attached is the transcript of the hearing from Florida state court in 2008, in which Epstein pled guilty to Florida state 
 charges. During the course of questioning by the judge, Epstein's Florida attorney (Jack Goldberger) stated (on Epstein's 
 behalf) that the NPA contained an obligation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida "not [to) 
 prosecute Mr. Epstein in the Southern District of Florida ...." See page 38 (emphasis added). I wanted you to be sure to 
 have this information, as the subject is likely to be important.

Hi M, 
 I wanted to make you aware of a recent filing (on Tuesday) by Jane Doe 1 and 2 in the Florida CVRA case. See 
 attached. You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies 
 in the case that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. 
 We filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday — and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA 
 violation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In 
 point (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, 
 the scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It 
 appears that Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. 
 I wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to 
 New York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra.

 M, 
 Looking forward to meeting with you and at your office tomorrow at 9:30am. As we've previously discussed, 
 I'm attaching a trial subpoena requiring to testify at our trial, which is scheduled to begin on November 29, 
 2021. I expect we will call to testify sometime in early December 2021 during that trial. 
 After our prep tomorrow, I do not think we will need to meet with again until we get closer to trial. I'll plan to 
 reach back out in early November to arrange for a VTC on which we can conduct a refresher prep session and to arrange 
 for travel and hotel for trial. 
 Thanks and see you tomorrow.

 Marc, 
 We're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct 
 criminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search 
 warrant returns in connection with the New York property. Perhaps you would be able to obtain those from Epstein's 
 criminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USAO_4381-4445, but 
 potentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a 
 protective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of 
 the search warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property), and 
 I hope this is useful in the interim. 
 Separately, I've conveyed your request for a meeting to discuss the possibility of resolving the Government's potential 
 forfeiture claims, and I haven't yet gotten a response to relay but will let you know as soon as I do (and will also provide 
 these dates in connection with your request). 
 thanks,

 Dear IM 
 We and the Duke of York set out to assist your investigation when the DOJ asked for his help in January 2020. 
 However, we regret to say that we have reached the conclusion that the DOJ's dealings with the Duke of York 
 have not been designed to seek his assistance in investigating and prosecuting the targets of the investigation but 
 instead have been used only to gather publicity for Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the 
 Southern District of New York. 
 It is essential, if justice is to be done for Epstein's victims, that a proper and thorough criminal investigation is 
 carried out. Although the public record indicates your office (SDNY) has been actively investigating Mr. Epstein 
 and other targets for more than 2 years, the first time you ever attempted to make contact and request The Duke 
 of York's help was on 2 January 2020. 
 The Duke instructed my firm to make contact with you pertaining to this request. When we made contact, you 
 confirmed that the Duke of York was not and is not a target of the US criminal investigation.

 Thanks, 
 EFTA00017978
Due to the publicity surrounding the investigation, we asked you to confirm that our discussions and any 
 interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with your rules. The Duke did not want to add 
 to the media circus that has now surrounded the investigation. On 10 January 2020 you confirmed 
 that any arrangements would indeed be kept confidential. 
 We indicated that we would refer back to you once we had dealt with the various issues and procedures, which 
 would need to be addressed to enable the Duke to cooperate to the fullest extent possible, including the need to 
 obtain all the information that you might need to consider. It was at that time that we informed you, by email 
 dated 20 January, that such preliminary issues would be dealt with within 14 days. It was also in that email that 
 we confirmed that The Duke has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
 Instead of waiting to hear from us (as you indicated on 22 January 2020), Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United 
 States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, chose to make a public statement about the Duke on 27 
 January 2020. This led to press reports that there had been "a wall of silence" and that there had been "zero co-
 operation" by the Duke. These statements were not true. They should not have been made. 
 Quite apart from your promise of confidentiality, in England it would not be thought to be in the interests of 
 justice for any prosecutor or investigator to make public statements about witnesses who may be willing, in 
 confidence, to assist their investigation. 
 In England, prosecutors and investigators try to make sure that the investigation and trial of serious criminal 
 cases take place in court and not in press conferences or publicity battles. 
 When we complained about the way the Duke (and we) had been treated by the DOJ, you refused to 
 apologise and you have now also gone back on your promise that any arrangements for the interview will be 
 confidential. 
 We cannot advise the Duke to speak to prosecutors who cannot be trusted to deal with him fairly nor to treat 
 what he says or does confidentially. He has reluctantly accepted our advice that, in those circumstances, there is 
 no purpose to be served in continuing to try to assist further. 
 Finally we have no wish to engage in any further publicity battle about the DOJ's conduct and for that reason we 
 ask that you treat this email as private and confidential.

Bailey and the TSC Suppressing Key Information to the FBI, PRA, and FCA Regarding the Jes 
 Staley JP Morgan Emails 
 Dear Mr Stride, 
 I believe you should have an email from me sent to yourself in particular, and copied to members of 
 the Treasury Select Committee on the 22nd of December 2019. I received a reply a month later from 
 Maciej Wenerski who handled it as a FOIA, with the obligatory one month grace before hitting the 
 send button. 
 I shall not repeat myself too much here, but the issue is raised in the public domain now, with the FBI, 
 FCA and the PRA all investigating Jes Staley's conduct while working at JP Morgan, which ostensibly 
 should disqualify him from holding a sernior position in a bank — he was never fit to be CEO of 
 Barclays. 
 Clearly according the FOIA responses I received from the TSC, the blackmail emails from Epstein 
 should have been enough to have had Staley dismissed in 2015, and would give substantial context to 
 the emails held by JP Morgan. The TSC has had the Epstein emails now for almost five years — and 
 no MP and no civil servant did the honourable thing and demand the FCA investigate. 
 Mr Stride, do you take personal responsibility for the TSC witholding key legal evidence to ongoing 
 inquiries? Which civil servants in the TSC are involved with the cover-up? Are they expecting a role in 
 Barclays after the dust has settled? 
 Andrew Bailey of the FCA and Lisa Osofsky of the SFO both explicity refused to investigate Staley 
 after I supplied them with FOIA responses. Did the TSC order the FCA and the SFO to stand down? It 
 is only the US press that has forced the British establishment's hand. Had Staley's role in JP Morgan 
 not been reported there would be no investigation. 
 I believe the general public would be correct to infer that Epstein not only blackmailed Parliament to 
 put Staley into position, but blackmailed it into accepting Bailey and Osofsky. Both would need to be 
 corrupted in order for Staley to keep his job. Why is Bailey being considered for top job at the Bank of 
 England when the FCA that he runs has a 98% disapproval rating from the general public. 
 Bailey and the FCA are answerable to the Treasury which is answerable to Parliament. 
 It is noted that Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney are being investigated for the LC&F scandal. 
 EFTA00019890
To remind you, my friend may well have been murdered for exposing the Epstein and 
 Staley story back in 2017. The timing of her death and the contents of her exposé were given as 
 evidence to Judge Worster of the Birmingham Court. The Court now refuses to accept my emails and 
 he stonewalls me. Worster served two restraining orders against me. The effect of these orders is 
 patent — they blocked the truth about Staley being publicly validated in a legal document and signed 
 off by a High Court judge. They also allowed Deutsche Bank to get away with never having to file 
 incriminating evidenec against themselves. 
 Did Worster take a bribe or was he ordered by the TSC to gag me? I presume if Staley was going to 
 bribe a judge to cover up his role in the Epstein paedophile circle, he would have to make sure the 
 Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett was in the loop. Lord Etherton seems to have implied Burnett was 
 himself a paedphile. You may have heard about this. I wonder if Burnett was Epstein's pick? Certainly 
 someone who works with both Lord Adrian PIE Fulford and Paul Kernaghan has to be highly suspect. I 
 guess the truth must be in your email system somewhere. 
 Did you bother asking the FCA to investigate Roger Jenkins, who also appears to have also gone to 
 Epstein's child-rape parties? 
 Yours sincerely 
 Mark Anthony Taylor

 Hello M, 
 7/25/2019 11:54 AM >>> 
 It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving him extra time to 
 review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
 I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of Tartaglione's cell 
 on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July 
 23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 
 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and 
 preserve the relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding officers 
 were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that 
 such footage also be preserved. 
 We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal 
 preservation request. 
 Thank you.

 We're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct 
 criminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search 
 warrant returns in connection with the New York property. Perhaps you would be able to obtain those from Epstein's 
 criminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USAO_4381-4445, but 
 potentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a 
 protective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of the 
 search warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property), and I 
 hope this is useful in the interim. 
 Separately, I've conveyed your request for a meeting to discuss the possibility of resolving the Government's potential 
 forfeiture claims, and I haven't yet gotten a response to relay but will let you know as soon as I do (and will also provide 
 these dates in connection with your request). 
 thanks,

 I feel that we can safely comply with her wishes to assist the investigation in the areas you have outlined without any

 Jeff, 
 Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have 
 reason to believe Ms. has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions 
 with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with 
 that view. In your further discussions with Ms. in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general 
 EFTA00019908
nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns 
 about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I 
 believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to 
 further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely. 
 Please let us know if any other information would be useful at this stage, and hopefully we can be in touch in the coming 
 weeks about productive next steps. 
 thank you,

 prep 
 • Discussed schedule for trial prep, mechanics of trial testimony. USAO will pay for 
 to fly up to NY for trial, with her husband and children as support. 
 • Since last meeting in January 2021, received $3.5 million award from the Victim 
 Compensation Fund run by Epstein's estate. Several hundred thousand dollars of that 
 amount was taken out, and ultimately received over $2 million. • used the money 
 to buy a new home for her family, a car, to pay off fines to get her license back, and to set 
 man account for her children. 
 • has had trouble sleeping over the past few months because she has dreams about 
 Epstein and is nervous about testifying at trial. U continues to speak with her counselor 
 every day and is prescribed medications to help with her mental health and addiction. 
 • • believes she lied to about her age when they were dating. She 
 believes she told that she was 17 years old when she was really younger. [NOTE: 
 was not feeling physically well during this interview, so no follow up questions were 
 asked about this topic during this meeting. AUSA arranged to meet with later in the 
 week when U will hopefully be feeling better.]

 Joe, 
 We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our 
 investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate 
 both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we 
 were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in 
 the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, 
 and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
 thank you,

 ust learned from Probation that Efrain Reyes died. It sounds like it was in his sleep. Given his history, I 
 think it may have been drug related, but perhaps not. Either way, my recollection is that you didn't expect to need him for 
 anything Epstein/MCC-related, but just want to keep you in the loop in case my memory is wrong.

 Good afternoon-
 Earlier this week, around 1:00 am 
 guards purposely awoke Ms. Maxwell because they observed her body shaking 
 and were concerned that she was having a seizure. 
 They determined she was shivering from the extremely cold temperature in her cell. 
 At approximately 3:00 am the following day, the guards again disrupted Ms. Maxwell's sleep 
 because her body was shaking. Again, they determined that she was 
 shivering and gave her a blanket. 
 The guards have now removed two of her blankets, claiming the blankets 
 are not authorized. Today, Ms. Maxwell awoke cold and headachy 
 with a sore throat. When medical staff came by she was too exhausted 
 to address her physical discomfort. 
 Please explain why guards purposely disrupt Ms. Maxwell's 
 sleep, determine she is shivering, and then remove blankets-
 her only source of warmth. This makes no sense, is detrimental 
 her health, and is utterly insensitive. 
 In addition, VTC viewing is less blurry on counsel's end but the image repeatedlybecomes broken 
 and then completely blacks out. 
 This is disrupting attorney-client communication, the ability to prepare for trial, and is negatively impacting 
 counsel's vision and concentration. 
 Please address and remedy this problems immediately.

 Good afternoon-
 Despite being subjected to the most unique, restrictive, and invasive conditions 
 of pretrial confinement, Ms. Maxwell has and continues to be a compliant detainee. 
 She obeys all orders and commands - often muffled by masks, 
 uttered behind prison doors, and/or combined with the din of background noise -
 as soon as they are audibly discernible. 
 Erratic enforcement of inconsistent rules and regulations imposed by 
 revolving teams of guards who exert varying degrees of officiousness 
 and contempt toward Ms. Maxwell is the fault of the MDC/BOP, 
 not Ms. Maxwell.

 Hi Bobbi-
 I apologize for the delay in response. I have been out of office sick. 
 We are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention 
 > wrote: 
 EFTA00019934
regarding the VTC units. All of the VTC units throughout the 
 institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective 
 barrier for the equipment. With that said, we will be doing test runs 
 to investigate concerns you have mentioned. 
 Furthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We 
 offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a daily basis, which she has 
 declined. 
 Additionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds 
 you are requesting to bring into the institution? 
 Best, 
 BOBBI C STERNHEIM < > 6/16/2021 10:23 AM >» 
 Good morning-
 As reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room 
 are negatively impacting attorney-client communication. 
 The video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. 
 I am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. 
 Also, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the 
 guards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if 
 Ms. Maxwell is "off camera" while leaning against a wall to soothe her 
 aching 
 back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing 
 machine 
 and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as 
 if any of this is funny. 
 The manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives 
 me reason to be concerned 
 about how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. 
 The courtesy of a response is requested. 
 Thank you-

Good afternoon, 
 It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday. In light of the recent filing and media reports, wanted me to clarify 
 her compensation with you. Aside from her regular salary, she did receive payments from Epstein in 2004 (to cover 
 gym membership and English classes), as well as a lump sum payment of cash during 2005 (less than $10k). Epstein 
 also paid for meals, salon appointments, clothing, etc. while she was working for him in 2005. You will not find any 
 lump sum payments made once she terminated her employment. 
 As always, feel free to contact me at any time if we can be of further assistance. Look forward to meeting again.

 We were certainly saddened to see the news this morning, as I know all of you were. I appreciate that you have more 
 pressing issues to deal with at the moment, but we are interested in whether you expect any aspect of the SDNY's 
 investigation/case to continue, potentially a separate civil forfeiture proceeding, or possible criminal prosecutions against 
 other defendants. We also understand that you may not be in a position to tell us anything at the moment, which is fine. 
 Just anticipating and preparing for questions we expect to be asked. Separately, having had the experience of a defendant 
 in a case I charged commit suicide, I wanted to add that it can be a complicated feeling, and to the extent it is helpful, I 
 think you brought a really important case and conducted yourselves in a professional, compassionate and impressive way. 
 So despite sad news, and frustrating news after putting so much work into filing a case and preparing to see it through, 
 heads should be held high.

 understanding that you conveyed, that more time is needed, they are prepared to delay tomorrow the autopsy

 Accordingly, he asked that you please contact him tonight or tomorrow morning to arrange logistics of the

 As of tonight, my understanding is that he has instructed his staff not to proceed tomorrow morning, pending 
 being in touch with you for further coordination.

 r • 
 >, 
 Mike, 
 I know we just spoke but I wanted to memorialize the information for everyone in one place — regarding your question 
 about the "a' (phonetic) who called an individual associated with Mr. Epstein regarding next steps for 
 recovery of Mr. Epstein's body, we confirmed with BOP that the call was not a hoax; Mr. does work for BOP / MCC 
 and his contact number is in fact 
 The slight divergence of the BOP account from your understanding is that BOP advised us that Mr. had contacted 
 Mr. Epstein's brother to advise that when the body is ready, part of BOP's responsibility is to arrange for its transport (and 
 possibly other notifications or logistics for next-of-kin). They were not trying to convey that the body is ready now; rather, 
 they expect it will be some time until that is the case, but they wanted to contact next-of-kin immediately. So you and/or 
 Mr. Epstein's brother should feel free to be in touch with BOP at that number if and when that would be useful. 
 Separately, it is in process for us to determine whether we are able to provide a contact name and number for the new 
 investigation(s), but in the interim, as we discussed, you should feel free to refer any individuals to the FBI tip line, which 
 will continue to do intake on all Epstein-related matters including the new investigation; that number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. 
 Finally, attached is a statement put out by our office this afternoon, so you have it directly. Given the active investigation 
 into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death, I think it is possible we will not receive additional substantive information in 
 the immediate future (or that if we do, it will be information we're not permitted to share outside our Office because of 
 the nature of the investigation), but we will continue to convey any substantive information that we can.

 Hi 
 Just a couple updates: 
 wrote: 
 I caught one of the officers who normally does SHU rec. He confirmed that Tartaglione can go to the roof for 
 recreation. SHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said Tartaglione is usually 
 sleeping, and once he eventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when Tartaglione and 
 Epstein were housed together, Epstein asked about rec. The officer told Epstein he would take him at 6:00 AM 
 before his attorneys showed up. Tartaglione was in the cell during this conversation, and the officer told me 
 made a comment like "I can take you up together" to both of them. 
 The Facilities Manager told me they talked to Tartaglione. He had no complaints about his cell. He only 
 complained that water leaked in his cell when people "took long showers." Facilities ran the shower for awhile 
 and didn't see the water leaking down to Tartaglione's cell, but if I give Tartaglione the benefit of the doubt, he 
 may be correct that the water makes its way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time. 
 Evening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave Tartaglione the three newspapers that arrived in the mail 
 yesterday morning. 
 I think that's it for now. Let me know if you need anything else.

 THE COURT: Great. 
 Again, good morning to all of you. This hearing that 
 we're having today considers the government's motion to dismiss 
 the indictment in this case. 
 I must add that it also serves as the opportunity for 
 me to thank all of you, the attorneys and the victims who are 
 here today, among others, for your very hard work and 
 dedication in this case. 
 We also have here today the U.S. Attorney for the 
 Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, who has also 
 been very helpful and indispensable in this matter. 
 The news on August 10, 2019, that Jeffrey Epstein had 
 been found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional 
 Center, at the MCC, was certainly shocking. Most of you, and 
 myself for that matter, were anticipating that the next steps 
 in this case would be defense motion practice, including a 
 motion to dismiss, followed by a trial on the merits before a 
 jury, if the motions were not successful, and through which the 
 accusers and the accused would come face to face, allowing 
 everyone to get their day in court. Mr. Epstein's death 
 obviously means that a trial in which he is a defendant cannot 
 take place. It is a rather stunning turn of events. 
 The government's motion to dismiss the indictment 
 because of Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, is

 relatively straightforward. In my view, a public hearing 
 clearly is nevertheless the preferred vehicle for its 
 resolution. 
 Incidentally, while I'm on this subject, I got some 
 help today from the New York Law Journal from two professors 
 who write that a hearing is -- let me tell you exactly what 
 they said. They say, in part, that this is an odd moment for 
 transparency in a criminal case. I think that is an odd 
 sentence to hear about, transparency in a criminal case. 
 They go on to say that normally, if a prosecutor seeks 
 to dismiss an indictment for such an obviously worthy reason, 
 the court would simply grant the request. As to that 
 statement, I respectfully say it is incorrect as a matter of 
 law. 
 They go on to say the judge would not schedule a 
 hearing and he definitely would not allow the victims to speak. 
 If he did hold a hearing, whatever informational interests the 
 victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to 
 attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking role. 
 I read it. It was incredulous. I'm still 
 incredulous. I don't quite understand at all. There is a 
 suggestion in the article that the reason they are making these 
 suggestions has to do with minimization of drama in this case. 
 In the Jeffrey Epstein case, there has not been much a 
 minimization of drama, and what little drama might happen

 today, I don't think it would be very significant. 
 On a somewhat more serious note, don't quote me on 
 this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of 
 that article is himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related 
 cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I'm 
 certain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was 
 not disclosed in the Law Journal. 
 But in any event, I think you know where I'm heading. 
 I respectfully disagree with the Law Journal piece. I was 
 saying that the government's motion is relatively 
 straightforward, and in my view, a public hearing is clearly, 
 nevertheless, the preferred vehicle for its resolution. I'm 
 still convinced of that. 
 A few may differ on this, but public hearings are 
 exactly what judges do. Hearings promote transparency and they 
 provide the court with insights and information which the court 
 may not otherwise be aware of. 
 The victims have been included in the proceeding today 
 both because of their relevant experiences and because they 
 should always be involved before rather than after the fact. 
 Indictment 19 CR 490 charges Jeffrey Epstein with sex 
 trafficking and with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. The 
 U.S. Attorney, on August 19, 2019, requested that the court 
 approve the government's proposed order of nolle prosequi. 
 think that's a rough justice. That means nolle prosequi,

 discontinuance by the prosecutor of all or of a part of the 
 case that he or she has commenced. 
 The government in its motion concludes that Epstein's 
 death abates these proceedings. In accordance with Federal 
 Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b), I determined to hold a public 
 hearing and I notified the victims that they would be given the 
 opportunity to be heard before any final action on the motion. 
 That is the purpose also of today's proceeding. I would do 
 that every time. 
 Also, recognized that Epstein, Mr. Epstein died before 
 any judgment of conviction against him had been obtained, and 
 that the government's proposed order appears, in form and 
 substance, to be appropriate. 
 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a) codifies the 
 nolle prosequi process. It is entitled dismissal, and it 
 states in relevant part that the government may, with leave of 
 the court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint, 
 and that leave of the court proviso, you should know, was added 
 as an amendment to the original draft of Rule 48, which had 
 originally provided for automatic dismissal upon the motion of 
 the government. 
 This proviso, in my judgment, is clearly directed 
 toward an independent judicial assessment of the public 
 interest in dismissing the indictment. Thus, even whereas, in 
 this case, the standard of court review is deferential, the

 court must still make its own independent determination. A 
 conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is 
 appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations. 
 It is also, in my view, required that the court 
 consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing 
 and before deciding whether to grant the motion. This is being 
 done here both as a matter of law and as a measure of respect 
 that we have for the victims' difficult decisions to come 
 forward in this matter. 
 In a case called United States v. Heaton, 
 H -e -a -t -o -n-, the government filed a Rule 48 motion for leave 
 to dismiss a charge against a defendant who allegedly committed 
 a sexual offense against a young victim. Although I should 
 point out, very importantly, that that defendant was still 
 alive, which distinguishes it from our case. 
 Nevertheless, I think it is irrelevant because in 
 evaluating the Rule 48 motion, then district Judge Paul G. 
 Cassell -- who is now a law professor at the University of Utah 
 and is regarded to be a noted expert in victims' rights --
 concluded that under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, victims 
 have broad rights that extend to a court's decision whether to 
 grant a government motion to dismiss under Rule 48. 
 I completely share that viewpoint in these 
 circumstances, even though the facts of our case, as I said, 
 are somewhat different from those in Heaton. I believe it is

 the court's responsibility, and manifestly within its purview, 
 to ensure that the victims in this case are treated fairly and 
 with dignity. 
 The fundamental substantive principle which applies in 
 considering the government's motion is termed the rule of 
 abatement. This principle originated in the English common 
 law. It was adopted by most U.S. federal courts, but more 
 recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism. The rule of 
 abatement is best explained in the Second Circuit case of 
 U.S. v. Wright. 
 In that Wright case, two defendants had pled guilty to 
 embezzlement and tax evasion. Both defendants appealed, but 
 one of the defendants died while his appeal was pending in the 
 Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule 
 of abatement, the judgment of conviction against the deceased 
 defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to 
 be dismissed. The Wright court held that when a convicted 
 defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending, 
 his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had 
 during the course of the prosecution. 
 The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that 
 when a criminal conviction abates upon the death of a 
 defendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that 
 conviction must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with 
 respect to associated forfeiture orders.

 This latter application of the rule of abatement 
 regarding forfeiture has not been universally accepted among 
 federal courts, but it certainly is the law in this circuit. 
 Some of you may be interested to know that some United States 
 courts, state courts, have criticized the rule of abatement, 
 particularly in the face of growing recognition of victims' 
 rights in the criminal justice system, including the Crime 
 Victims' Rights Act. 
 It has been written and contended in the Brooklyn Law 
 Review -- I can give you the cite later -- that when courts 
 abate criminal convictions, they reimpose a burden on victims 
 that legislatures intended to alleviate through these victim 
 rights statutes. The state Supreme Court has even concluded 
 that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides 
 the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of 
 abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and 
 its constitution now require the criminal justice system to 
 accommodate the rights of crime victims. Further, that the 
 abatement of criminal convictions has important implications 
 for these rights. 
 But coming back to our case, which is what you are 
 concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude 
 that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant 
 as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the 
 Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when

 Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction. 
 So that's just some background I wanted to share with 
 you. At this point in time, I would like to turn to the 
 government prosecutors to hear from them in support of their 
 Rule 48 application to dismiss the Epstein indictment. 
 MS. : Thank you, your Honor. 
 Would you like me to address the court from the 
 podium? 
 THE COURT: If you wouldn't mind. 
 MS. : Thank you, your Honor. 
 I believe your Honor has accurately summarized the 
 state of the law, as set forth in our papers, in light of the 
 clear Second Circuit law, that upon the death of a defendant 
 before a final entry of a judgment of conviction, all 
 proceedings must be abated. 
 In light of that clear law, the government is legally 
 obligated to seek dismissal of the pending indictment against 
 Jeffrey Epstein, and we respectfully submit, likewise, that the 
 entry of the proposed order is similarly required by law. 
 A few notes to make about that, though, your Honor. 
 To be very clear, dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey 
 Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's 
 ongoing investigation into other potential coconspirators, nor 
 does it prevent the bringing of a new case in the future or the 
 prosecution of new defendants.

 continuing to explore the possibility of seeking civil 
 forfeiture of any assets that were used to facilitate the 
 crimes charged in this indictment. Indeed, as has been stated 
 publicly, investigations into those matters have been ongoing, 
 remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the 
 indictment here. 
 I would also like to note that, as the government has 
 previously mentioned, this dismissal in no way lessens the 
 government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case, 
 both those who have come forward and those who have yet to do 
 so. We agree with your Honor's sentiment that those victims 
 should be respected, and we appreciate your Honor's recognition 
 of that. 
 One housekeeping matter that I did want to reference 
 for your Honor. The protective order in this case requires 
 destruction or return of any and all discovery material upon 
 conclusion of the case. We have been in communication with 
 defense counsel, who have confirmed that they have returned all 
 physical copies that they have of discovery that the government 
 has produced to date, and they are in the process of deleting 
 any copies that they may have made. So the parties are in 
 compliance with the protective order. 
 Finally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims 
 in this case, and particularly those who are here in court

 today. I'll note that in light of the court's order indicating 
 that the victims and their counsel would be permitted to be 
 heard in court here today, the government has endeavored to 
 provide notice to all known victims of today's proceeding. We 
 did so either directly where a victim was not represented by 
 counsel or through counsel where a victim is represented by an 
 attorney. 
 The government does not know exactly how many victims 
 or their attorneys are here today and we do not know how many 
 of them or their counsel would like to speak. To the extent 
 any individuals do wish to speak, we do not know the substance 
 of what they would like to say. We have left that entirely up 
 to the individual decisions of the victims and their attorneys. 
 I will note, though, that throughout this case, the 
 government has endeavored and done our utmost to fulfill our 
 obligations under the Crimes Victims' Rights Act. We have done 
 so by trying to keep as many victims as we are aware of up to 
 date about the ongoing case and about any developments in the 
 case. 
 We will continue to provide services and offer 
 services to any of the victims in this case, even after the 
 indictment is dismissed. Both the U.S. Attorney's office and 
 the FBI have been in touch with all known victims or have 
 attempted to be in touch with all known victims, either again 
 directly where victims are not represented by counsel or

 through counsel where they have attorneys. We have expressed 
 to them that services are available for those who wish to take 
 advantage of them. 
 Unless the court has any questions for me, the 
 government will otherwise rest on its papers. 
 THE COURT: I just have one question. 
 The protective order, is that self-executing or do 1 
 need to do something? 
 MS. : It is self-executing, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Thanks very much, Ms. 
 MS. : Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Yes. 
 I'll turn to counsel for the defense at this time. 
 Mr. Weingarten, I'm happy to hear from you. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you. 
 Your Honor, I think it is an understatement of the 
 year to say the world looks and feels differently today than it 
 did the last time I was before you. For us, the elephant in 
 the room is what happened to our client. I would like to tell 
 you how we see the world and where we are on that subject. 
 We start with the Attorney General's statements, 
 public statements, that there were very serious improprieties 
 in the jail. We obviously read the press. We see that the 
 warden has been taken out. We see that the guards on duty at 
 the time have been put on leave. We understand guards are

 allegations that people at the time who had responsibility for 
 protecting our client falsified information. We understand 
 that there were orders out there that Jeffrey Epstein was never 
 to be left alone and that the orders were ignored by many of 
 the employees of the prison. 
 In a word, yikes. In addition, obviously we followed 
 the medical examiner's report, or we haven't followed the 
 report, we haven't seen it, but heard conclusions, initially 
 not enough evidence to come to a conclusion, wanted to see 
 more. We assumed she was talking about the videotapes, but 
 then came to the conclusion that it was suicide. 
 We report to the court that --
 THE COURT: Suicide by hanging --
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
 THE COURT: -- was her conclusion? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
 And we report to the court that we had a doctor there 
 at the time, and we also have been in receipt of a tremendous 
 amount of medical and scientific evidence volunteered to us 
 opining that the injuries suffered, as reported, were far more 
 consistent with assault than with suicide, and we are happy to 
 supply the court with all the information that we have. 
 Now, in addition, as the court noted, we were underway 
 with our pretrial motions, and as the court obviously

 understands, the NPA and the role of the NPA was going to be 
 critically important. And I would simply like to report that 
 we went pretty far along. 
 We interviewed all of the relevant lawyers on the 
 defense side who participated in the NPA, and we were satisfied 
 that we had a very strong argument that every one of those 
 lawyers believed with an objective basis that the deal was 
 global. That is, at the time --
 THE COURT: I'm sorry, that? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: The deal of the NPA was global. That 
 is, more specifically, at the time, 
 agents knew of conduct in New York, 
 defense counsel negotiating in good 
 the Florida prosecutors and 
 and that no competent 
 faith with the prosecutors 
 would have ever agreed to a deal back then that allowed New 
 York prosecutors to indict for precisely the same conduct in 
 the future, which, of course, is what happened. 
 In addition, we have come up with very powerful 
 evidence, we believe, that Florida prosecutors, who 
 participated in the deal, steered the victims and the alleged 
 victims to New York on more than one occasion because they did 
 not want to suffer the sleights of attacks against them. So we 
 have advanced the ball on this very subject and we are prepared 
 to completely report to the court as to where we are and what 
 we've done. 
 Another point. We obviously had contact with our

 client at or around the time of his death, and obviously the 
 attorney -client privilege survives death and we are not going 
 to forfeit the privilege, but we will report to the court, with 
 as much specificity as the court may want, that at or around 
 the time of his death, we did not see a 
 suicidal person. Details to follow, if 
 The 800-pound gorilla, for us, 
 despairing, despondent 
 the court wishes. 
 of course, are the 
 video surveillance tapes. Obviously we assume there is a tape 
 that leads directly to the door where Jeffrey Epstein was 
 housed. If that tape reports for 12 hours before his death 
 that no one went in and out of that room, then the suggestion 
 that there was something other than a suicide seems 
 preposterous. 
 But there is no such evidence that has surfaced to 
 date. Just the opposite. We have heard, and we actually read 
 in the press, that the tapes were either corrupted or not 
 functioning. Talk about a yikes. If, in fact, the system was 
 broken for six months before Jeffrey Epstein was housed, I 
 mean, that would be stunning incompetence. If it was allowed 
 to continue to be inoperative when Jeffrey Epstein was housed, 
 it would be incompetence times ten. But what if the tapes only 
 broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he 
 was killed or the day he died? Then we're in a completely 
 different situation. 
 So where does this lead? I think where it leads,

 Judge, is there are incredibly important questions that remain 
 open. The public interest in this matter is obvious from this 
 courtroom. There are conspiracy theories galore. We are all 
 for finding the truth. We believe this court has an 
 indispensable role to play. 
 Whether or not this indictment is dismissed, I think 
 this court has the inherent authority to find out what happened 
 on its watch. Obviously, when the court detained Jeffrey 
 Epstein, the court did not anticipate that weeks later he would 
 be dead in his cell. I think given the inherent authority of 
 the court, the court should make inquiry. 
 This could come in many forms. Obviously the court 
 made inquiry as to what happened in the first incident. When 
 there was an allegation of an attempted suicide, the court made 
 inquiry. The court obviously was interested. 
 I recall your language. You talked about that being 
 one of the several open questions indicating an interest on the 
 court for the others as well. Obviously, the ultimate question 
 is what happened to the client. 
 THE COURT: You're talking about the July 23, 2019 
 incident? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
 The court obviously could hold hearings. The court 
 could assign a lawyer to help the court. I think this is an 
 area where there is intense public interest. We have complete

 confidence in the prosecutors in the Southern District and the 
 FBI to do a competent investigation. But these are allegations 
 against serious components of the United States Department of 
 Justice. Sometimes the appearance of justice is just as 
 important as justice itself. 
 I think the court supervising, or at least keeping an 
 interest in this proceeding, is incredibly important for the 
 public to have confidence in the ultimate findings, and 
 certainly for us to have confidence in the ultimate findings. 
 One more issue, Judge. The conditions of the jail, in 
 a word, they were dreadful. Not just for Jeffrey Epstein, but 
 for many of the prisoners over there. This is a prison within 
 the shadows of this courthouse. The situation is rife with 
 vermin. The abuse and the conditions in that prison, in 
 word, are a disgrace and everybody knows it. 
 A person with authority told us, someone with 
 knowledge, that the prisoners in Guantanamo -- and he spoke 
 with personal knowledge -- are treated better than the 
 prisoners right across the way. The feds certainly know how 
 run a disciplined, clean prison. I've been in 20 of them. 
 They know how to do it just fine. And the question is, why in 
 the world does it not happen down the road? I think that is a 
 perfectly legitimate subject for the court to make inquiry. 
 In a word, we want the court to help us find out what 
 happened. The court has a role to play. It is the institution 
 a

 So whether or not you dismiss the indictment, to us, 
 is beside the point. We want you to stay on the case, we want 
 you to conduct an investigation, and we want to know what 
 happened here. 
 Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Just so it is clear, so your view on the 
 motion directly on its merits of the nolle prosequi order and 
 application by the U.S. Attorney, do you have a view on that? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: I think if the court felt that the 
 case had to stay alive for the court to continue, we would 
 oppose it. I think --
 THE COURT: I'm sorry, if what? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: If the issue, if you took the 
 position for you to conduct the investigation or lead the 
 investigation or participate in the investigation, then we 
 want, the role we want you to play, if the indictment has to be 
 alive, we would oppose the motion. 
 I don't think you need to do that. I think you can 
 dismiss the indictment. 
 THE COURT: So you're suggesting that you support the 
 government's motion, just viewed in the context of --
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, of course.

 THE COURT: Absolutely. 
 MR. WEINBERG: Thank you, sir. 
 Thank you, as an out-of-town lawyer for the privilege 
 to appear in front of you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: It's my pleasure. 
 MR. WEINBERG: First, as to the conditions, we think 
 your Honor trusted the government, the Bureau of Prisons, to 
 keep our client safe and keep him in civilized conditions. The 
 government will again ask, as to other defendants, that they be 
 detained at the MCC, some subset of them will end up in the SHU 
 unit. 
 It is a horrific. I've called it medieval. There's 
 vermin on the floor. There is wet from the plumbing. There is 
 no sunlight. There is limited exercise. It is simply 
 conditions that no pretrial detainee -- and I would go farther 
 as a criminal defense lawyer -- no United States defendant 
 should be subjected to. 
 Certain judges have taken views of the conditions. We 
 would urge your Honor, the government talks about and we talk 
 about transparency, to see what kind of conditions there exist 
 within 50 or 100 yards of one of the great United States 
 district courts. 
 Second, in terms, we have a profound problem with the 
 conclusions of the medical examiner. There are for three

 reasons, your Honor. 
 One is the timing of Mr. Epstein's demise. It was on 
 August 10. On August 12, a bail pending appeal motion was 
 being filed in the Second Circuit. On August 12 or 13, the 
 United States Attorneys were going to respond to our request 
 for the preservation and production of documents that would 
 have facilitated and furthered our efforts to demonstrate 
 communications between the Southern District of Florida, the 
 Northern District of Georgia, which was standing in the shoes 
 of the Southern District of Florida main justice and the 
 Southern District. 
 In other words, we were beginning the process 
 discharging our responsibilities. There had been no new 
 evidence that Mr. Epstein had committed any offense against a 
 minor after 2005. The subject matter of the New York 
 prosecution was squarely within the heartland of the Florida 
 NPA. We had a significant motion to dismiss. This was not a 
 futile, you know, defeatist attitude. 
 Third, we had all the discovery motions that your 
 Honor had scheduled. So the timing for a pretrial detainee to 
 commit suicide on August 10, when his bail pending appeal 
 motion is being filed on August 12, strikes us as implausible. 
 Second, we had an independent doctor who was present 
 at the autopsy which occurred on August 11. On August 11, the 
 city medical examiner's findings were inconclusive. We are

 told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken 
 bones in Mr. Epstein's neck, in his larynx, are more consistent 
 with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide, if 
 you will, than with suicide. It doesn't exclude suicide, but 
 the pure medical forensic evidence creates profound issues 
 about what happened to him. 
 Also the time of death. Our medical examiner's 
 opinion is it occurred at least 45 minutes and probably hours 
 before 6:30 a.m. on August 10, when he was first found, if you 
 will, according to the reports. Yet he was moved, something 
 that is not ordinary in these circumstances. 
 I would also --
 THE COURT: Excuse me. He was moved? 
 MR. WEINBERG: Instead of having the cell in the 
 condition it was found, if he had been dead for 45 minutes or 
 two hours or four hours, there were efforts to move him and, 
 therefore, make it more difficult to reconstruct whether or not 
 he died of suicide or some other cause. 
 I spoke to Stacey Richmond, who is a responsible 
 member of this court who represents the family of Mr. Epstein. 
 She spoke to the medical examiner on the Friday after 
 Mr. Epstein's death and asked why, if the conclusion was made 
 late in the afternoon on Friday that week. She specifically 
 asked about what extrinsic nonmedical evidence caused the 
 medical examiner to go from uncertain to suicide, and she was

 told that the medical examiner had seen nine minutes of one 
 video which was on a stairwell between floors at the MCC. She 
 was told that the principal video that would have showed the 
 whole hall was corrupted. It was in DC with the FBI to see if 
 they can reconstruct it. 
 And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did, 
 you know, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in 
 the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado known 
 to the MCC before August 10, or was this corruption occurring 
 on August 10, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the 
 servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was 
 suicide rather than some other cause. 
 So with my co-counsel, we ask your Honor, it is not a 
 question of trust or not trust. They ask you to detain people 
 and you trust the Bureau of Prisons. And it is within your 
 inherit authority, your Honor, to find out what happened to our 
 client. 
 We are angry about the conditions he was held in. And 
 we're also angry, quite frankly, your Honor, that the only 
 source of information that we get as to what happened to him is 
 through the media rather than through the United States 
 Attorney's office. We've made requests informal. We have 
 made Touhy requests. We've been told there is a pending 
 investigation. 
 But we trust your Honor and the judiciary, and with

 all due respect, we believe there is an inherent and central 
 role, a pivotal role in your Honor to find out what happened to 
 a defendant in a case before the court, whether or not the 
 court grants the nolle pros today or whether it holds it 
 pending an investigation into Mr. Epstein's death. 
 We're not here without significant doubts regarding 
 the conclusion of suicide. We are not here to say what 
 happened. We don't know what happened. But we deeply want to 
 know what happened to our client. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 THE COURT: And you, as Mr. Weingarten, have the same 
 view of the nolle prosequi motion? 
 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: OK. 
 MS. : Your Honor, may I respond to some of those 
 points? 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 MS. : Thank you, your Honor. 
 Just briefly. With the exception of the noting that 
 the defense does not have an objection to the government's 
 motion, virtually everything else that defense counsel just 
 argued, respectfully is completely irrelevant to the purposes 
 of today's proceeding and to the motion that is pending before 
 your Honor. 
 As an initial matter, the question --

 THE COURT: Well, it may be. Well, I don't know. Yo. 
 say irrelevant. 
 It is a public hearing, and I think it is fair game 
 for defense counsel to raise its concerns. 
 MS. : Certainly, your Honor. But it is 
 irrelevant to whether or not the motion should be granted. 
 THE COURT: Right. I get that. 
 MS. : I would also note that the question of 
 Mr. Epstein's death is the subject of an ongoing and active 
 investigation, as has been publicly noted, by a separate team 
 of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District 
 of New York, separate from the team who is handling this 
 prosecution, as well as a separate team of FBI agents. 
 There is an ongoing and active grand jury 
 investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's 
 death. It is the function of a grand jury and of the Federal 
 Bureau of Investigation to investigate crimes in the federal 
 court system. It is not the purview, respectfully, of the 
 court to conduct an investigation into uncharged matters. 
 So respectfully, we disagree with defense counsel's 
 suggestion that the court has some authority to conduct an 
 independent investigation. To the extent any other defendants 
 who are detained in the MCC have concerns about the conditions 
 or believe that the conditions are relevant to a future or 
 current bail determination, it is for those defendants and

 their counsel to raise those arguments and for the judges 
 hearing those arguments to evaluate those claims. It is not 
 relevant to today's proceedings. 
 Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: In those other cases, Ms. , judges do 
 have authority to investigate, but don't here? 
 MS. : Not to investigate, your Honor, but to 
 hear arguments about the conditions of confinement in the MCC 
 as they may relate to any bail determination. I believe that 
 was the argument that was made. 
 The bigger picture here, your Honor, is that the focus 
 of today's proceeding, as we understand it, is to allow the 
 victims who have gathered here today to be heard and to comment 
 upon the case and to comment upon the motion that is pending, 
 and to bring this case to a close. 
 THE COURT: Got it. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: May I? 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: We obviously saw this as, perhaps, 
 the last opportunity to be before you, and we wanted to take 
 advantage of the opportunity to say our peace and thank you for 
 allowing us. 
 There is precedent here. Ted Stevens, the Senator 
 from Alaska case in Washington, DC, Judge Emmet Sullivan 
 ordered an independent investigation by a private lawyer when

 he was deeply troubled by the alleged Brady violations. I 
 represented the prosecutors in that case, so I'm very, very 
 familiar with it. 
 It is analogous. It is a situation where there was 
 tremendous controversy over what happened in the case and 
 whether or not the prosecutors went off the reservation. Judge 
 Sullivan -- and there were three or four independent -- not 
 independent, DOJ inquiries into the very same matter. But 
 Judge Sullivan wanted his own opportunity to make a judgment 
 with his own independent investigation. 
 THE COURT: OK. 
 MR. WEINBERG: If I could just add one precedent, your 
 Honor. 
 The Chief judge in the District of Massachusetts or 
 the Chief Judge at the time, Judge Wolf, in a case called 
 U.S. v. Fleming, when the conditions at Walpole, which is a 
 state prison where federal prisoners were being held -- we 
 don't have a federal MCC in Boston went to the prison, 
 stayed in the prison to determine whether or not the complaints 
 about the conditions were authentic. 
 I think your Honor has the inherent authority to go to 
 the ninth floor and see how the MCC houses pretrial detainees. 
 Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Are you saying that whether or not the 
 motion is granted that is pending before us?

 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor. 
 I think, like when appeals are taken, bail issues 
 remain before the district court. Jurisdiction is not 
 completely divested. Your Honor issued a pretrial detention 
 order and your Honor has the power, the inherent authority, 
 they are not going to refuse to allow you to go look at the 
 ninth floor. They are going to count on you to make decisions 
 in the future. 
 I just trust that the executive branch is not going to 
 prevent the judicial branch from looking into the death of 
 Jeffrey Epstein or the conditions in the SHU unit at the MCC, 
 sir. 
 THE COURT: Great. Thank you. 
 MS. : May I, your Honor? 
 Just very briefly, your Honor. I would note that upon 
 the dismissal of the indictment, which I believe the parties 
 agree is appropriate in this case, there would be no case. 
 There would be no jurisdiction for the court to conduct any 
 sort of inquiry, even if the court had such authority. 
 THE COURT: Right. 
 OK. I think we've heard enough. 
 It is at this point in the hearing that I would like 
 to call upon victims' counsel, plural, for any remarks they may 
 have and they may wish to make. Also, to introduce their 
 clients, those of them who wish to be heard.

 Mr. Edwards and I see and I see Mr. Boise as well -- I know

 It would be helpful if whoever is speaking, both Mr. Edwards

 Are we going to hear from Mr. Edwards first, is that

 multitude of reasons, some out of fear of public exposure, 
 others because the way in which this case ended will never

 bring full justice, and they decided it was best for them not 
 to talk today. 
 Some of my clients are going to address the court that 
 are here today. Others are not. Some are going to use their 
 names, and have in the past, and others wish to remain 
 anonymous. And I have instructed each of them to inform the 
 court reporter that they will be proceeding as Jane Doe so that 
 the court reporter can take them down. 
 THE COURT: For those who wish to remain anonymous? 
 MR. EDWARDS: Exactly, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: And that is satisfactory, as far as I am 
 concerned. 
 MR. EDWARDS: Before we do that, I would like to 
 address a couple of the things that have occurred this morning. 
 First of all, whether relevant or not, I personally, 
 and on behalf of my clients, do appreciate the presentation 
 that Mr. Weingarten made and Mr. Marty Weinberg made. 
 I have tremendous respect for Mr. Weinberg. I've 
 worked with him through this and related cases for years, and I 
 understand the reason why they made the presentation that they 
 made. 
 There is two things of interest to our clients in that 
 respect. One is, because of the tragic ending, that none of my 
 clients wanted, nor did I, nor did anyone else, if there is 
 some civil rights violation and there is some civil remedy for

 Second, Mr. Epstein's untimely death, the timing is 
 curious to us. But more so, it makes it absolutely impossible 
 for the victims to ever get the day in court that they wanted 
 in court and to get full justice. That now can never happen. 
 I know that Mr. Epstein's attorneys say he wanted it, and they 
 know, we did too. And there are a lot of people here today 
 that are very sad by the way that this ended for both 
 Mr. Epstein and the fact that full justice was robbed from 
 them, once again. 
 The second issue I wanted to address was the Law 
 Review or the Law Journal article that your Honor referenced, 
 which is troubling because the opinion seems to say that 
 transparency is not appropriate in the criminal system and is 
 not appropriate at this point in time. 
 That's tough to swallow, especially in this case, 
 given the long history of this case. Personally, it is tough 
 to swallow, and on behalf of my clients, I can say that is very 
 concerning. Transparency is the only way that the justice 
 system works. We know this because there was a similar 
 investigation of Mr. Epstein many years ago, from 2005 to 2008. 
 My personal involvement in this case was because a 
 young female came into my office named 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 and she

 came to me not asking to file a lawsuit against Jeffrey 
 Epstein, but simply asking for the government to talk to her. 
 She was cooperating in an FBI investigation and wanted the 
 government to speak with her, and I thought that was going to 
 be an easy task. 
 It was only a few months later that we learned that 
 this investigation that was represented to my client in written 
 form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient. 
 Basically, to hang tight. It was resolved by way of a secret 
 deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had 
 been identified of Mr. Epstein's abuse in Florida to ever 
 participate in a single hearing. There was a hearing. They 
 were never notified. 
 I then went on to represent many of them in civil 
 cases and also in extensive pro bono work. And I can tell your 
 Honor that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and 
 harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was 
 aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights 
 in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were 
 treated as if they didn't matter. They were not allowed their 
 rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act to meaningfully 
 confer with prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be 
 treated with dignity. That is what this is supposed to be 
 about, and to have notice of hearings. 
 So I do want to thank your Honor, and especially the

 prosecutors who have worked this investigation and this case, 
 which is very different in experience for all of my clients and 
 the other Epstein victims in this case, because they were 
 allowed to be a part of the process. While some of them 
 elected not to be here today, that opportunity should always be 
 allowed for them. 
 In 2008, we filed that case under the Crime Victims' 
 Rights Act because our clients' rights were violated, and as 
 your Honor knows, a federal judge has ruled in our clients' 
 favor that their rights were violated. So this hearing today 
 means a lot to them. The fact that they may never get their 
 chance to speak in court, they may never get complete closure, 
 and all of us have to wonder, if their rights had been afforded 
 them the first time, would any of us be here right now. Or 
 wouldn't it more likely be the case that everyone, including 
 Jeffrey Epstein, would have turned out better for it? 
 Today, I have not only represented, but met and become 
 very close with many of these victims. Many of these 
 survivors. They are very strong people. They are people who 
 have persevered through a lot of adversity. It's been a roller 
 coaster of emotions that has led us to where we are today. And 
 while they have all been cast over the years because of the 
 secrecy of the first investigation, in the shadow as victims, 
 you can't put them all in one bucket and say one size fits all. 
 They are each individual people who were harmed differently and

 distinctly through not only the abuse, but the system. 
 And on behalf of all of them, I would like to thank 
 your Honor for the fairness with which they've been treated, 
 and the United States Attorney's office for the way in which 
 you have handled this investigation, and especially how you 
 have treated the victims in this case.

 My name is and I'm a victim 
 of Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for 
 years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health. Jeffrey 
 Epstein has done nothing but manipulate our justice system, 
 where he has never been held accountable for his actions, even 
 to this day. 
 Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other 
 victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for 
 that he is a coward. 
 I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's for seeking 
 justice that has been long over due, and most importantly, 
 given us, the victims, our day in court to speak our peace and 
 find some sort of closure. I feel very angry and sad that 
 justice has never been served in this case. Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Thanks very much. 
 MR. EDWARDS: I believe my next client who is going to 
 speak is probably going to speak as Jane Doe. 
 JANE DOE NO. 1: Yes, Jane Doe.

 what's already been said, and just about the question of 
 Jeffrey's death. I don't know what the relevance is to this 
 hearing, but I do know that it is profoundly relevant to my

 like I am learning the ways that he's impacted me as a complex 
 situation, but he was also a major part of my life. As 
 destructive as that relationship was and as much of a villain 
 as we have created him to be -- based on facts we've created 
 him to be a villain -- he's a complex villain and actually all 
 of that is irrelevant. Anybody deserves -- an investigation is 
 the right thing to do. Like, we do need to know how he died. 
 It felt like a whole new trauma all over again, and I 
 don't know why, you know, because I I'm trying to defend 
 myself against him at this point in my life, but it still does 
 not feel good. It didn't feel good to wake up that morning and 
 find out that he had allegedly committed suicide. Okay. But I 
 also wanted to say to the press, I'm reading -- I read my story 
 in the paper. I read so many other girls' stories that are so 
 similar to my own, and everything that's been focused on is not 
 the most important part of it. 
 There was -- the problem with focusing on these, the 
 facts of the situation, that were out of the ordinary and like 
 because he was such a grand person, and it was just a unique 
 situation. I know that that's the more interesting side of the 
 story, but I don't want to be used as entertainment. And the 
 problem, the fundamental problem of the whole situation is the 
 element of exploitation and coercion, and these are things that 
 so many girls can relate to.

 And even though this Jeffrey Epstein brought it to a 
 grand scale, on some level, a lot of girls could relate to the 
 trauma that we are talking about, and even though this whole 
 situation sucks, I would like to think that it may be possibly 
 a catalyst for change because, obviously, as we're seeing with 
 the "Me Too" movement, change needs to happen and it's -- what 
 I'm seeing in the papers is not a common story, but it's so 
 much more common than you realize. That's all. Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Thank you very much. 
 MR. EDWARDS: I believe that the next client is going 
 to also be a Jane Doe; so I think for the purposes of the 
 record it will be Jane Doe 2. 
 THE COURT: Yes. 
 JANE DOE NO. 2: Good morning, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Good morning. How are you? 
 JANE DOE NO. 2: Doing okay. I hadn't prepared any 
 words to speak today, but there is something that was on my 
 mind this morning when I got here. It's been on my mind in 
 reading through the press and through the people that I've 
 spoken to about it, friends, family. It's something that's 
 bothered me because I think it has a lot of blame in it, as 
 well, a little bit of what my friend, who was up here, was 
 speaking about. 
 I think that a lot of people asked why we spent so 
 much time, why we stayed. It's an experience that's really

 hard to explain to people who haven't gone through it. I think 
 there's a writer, Thomas Nagel, who wrote an essay called "What 
 is it like to be a bat?" And I think that he touches on it 
 pretty strongly and if you haven't experienced something, it's 
 very hard to fully understand why someone makes the decisions 
 they do and what the circumstances were. 
 I don't want to speak for all of the victims. I think 
 each of us has a different story and different circumstances 
 for why we stayed in it, but for me, I think he was really 
 strategic in how he approached each of us. Things happened 
 slowly over time. We didn't -- it almost was like, putting it 
 like that analogy of a frog being in a pan of water and slowly 
 turning the flame up. You didn't realize it was happening, and 
 it just -- I don't think anyone can fully understand the 
 experience, but I just -- the blame feels very strong. 
 There's a lot of support as well, but i just want 
 people to try and understand that we aren't bad people. We 
 weren't trying to -- it wasn't a situation where we were trying 
 to extort money from someone. A lot of us were in very 
 vulnerable situations and in extreme poverty, circumstances 
 where we didn't have anyone on our side, to speak on our 
 behalf, and that's really scary. 
 You start to blame yourself because, at first, you 
 don't tell anyone what's happening, and it becomes your deep, 
 dark secret that you tried to keep from everyone. And I didn't

 even know I was a victim until I spoke with my lawyers. I had 
 no idea. I had so much self-hatred and doubt and just guilt 
 for everything. I still do. I still don't feel like I deserve 
 to say I'm a victim, and I think that's a big problem with our 
 society right now, that people are still blaming victims, and I 
 think that does need to change. 
 I hope that today people understand that each of us 
 has a story, has a past, has a family and just give us a chance 
 to you know, that's basically all I just wanted to say. 
 THE COURT: Thank you so much. 
 JANE DOE NO. 2: Thank you so much. 
 THE COURT: Okay. 
 MR. EDWARDS: Okay. I think that the next person who 
 is going to speak is also going to be speaking as Jane Doe; so 
 for the purpose of the record, Jane Doe No. 3. 
 JANE DOE NO. 3: Thank you for allowing us to speak 
 today. I came to New York City 15 years ago to pursue modeling 
 from a small town. I signed on with an agency and was excited 
 to pursue my passion and my dream. Several months later, I met 
 a female who told me about Mr. Epstein. She portrayed him as 
 an amazing man who genuinely cared for people and that he was 
 going to be able to help me in a modeling career. 
 I was excited to meet him, after hearing her talk 
 about him. He sounded like an amazing person. An introduction 
 was made at his New York home, and it is there that I was

 sexually assaulted. I left his home, after he threw me, 
 basically put money on the table, and I was ashamed. I was 
 embarrassed. This was not the way I was brought up, and I 
 couldn't believe this had happened to me. 
 I left and my world kind of spiraled after that. I 
 stopped going on modeling castings. I gained weight. I became 
 depressed. I stopped going out with my friends, and only five 
 months after I had been in New York City to pursue my dream, 
 left. I left the modeling industry, and I left New York City, 
 and I totally switched my career paths. 
 I buried this deep within me, and all of the new 
 occurrences that have come up in the media is what brought it 
 back up for me. And I feel sickened and saddened that it took 
 so many years, and God knows how many victims, for this to 
 finally come out, but I'm thankful it did. And I'm just angry 
 that he's not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his 
 actions. So I thank you for your time. 
 THE COURT: You're very welcome. 
 MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 4, I believe, 
 is going to speak now. 
 JANE DOE NO. 4: Good morning, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Good morning. 
 JANE DOE NO. 4: I just have something very short to 
 say. I met Jeffrey Epstein at a very vulnerable place in my 
 life, and whatever the outcome is with everything, I just

 wanted to express that we, the victims, we will always carry 
 irreparable damage and pain throughout our lives after this. 
 It's something that's never going to go away. 
 You know, whoever we marry in our life, whatever 
 future we have in our life, it's always going to be something 
 that's always there for us. And I'm very nervous right now. 
 And Jeffrey Epstein, he took away the chance I had at having 
 the future I had envisioned for myself as a young girl, and I 
 think many of us here today will never fully heal from that 
 pain and the heartache that we'll continue carrying with us. 
 So I just wanted to say that. It's something that 
 it's irreparable. I can't even really use a better word to 
 describe that. So thank you for hearing us today. 
 THE COURT: You're very welcome. 
 MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 5 would like to 
 speak. 
 JANE DOE NO. 5: This is a letter that I wrote; so 
 it's going to be: Dear Jeffrey, I think you are a mentally 
 disturbed human being. You used your power to make me believe 
 at a young age that I could have my dreams of being a model. 
 You paid for your freedom. You violated my rights. You should 
 have to pay for them, just as anyone else. You got a plea deal 
 that no one else would have been able to get. You used your 
 money to get out of paying the price for your actions. 
 Also, as a victim, I never got to see what the

 agreement was or why the special treatment got approved. 
 think you should have been in jail for several years in 
 population and live like everyone else that is mentally 
 disturbed like you. You paid for yourself to get special 
 treatment while you were in jail. I don't even think you spent 
 a day in a jail as a normal human being. 
 You had investigators come to my house and also went 
 to my friend's house to question them. I will never be able to 
 over -- I will never be able to get over the overwhelming 
 emotions and embarrassment I experienced from that trauma. I 
 needed therapy several times a week and had high stress and 
 anxiety levels. 
 You paid your way to make the public think that the 
 girls had nothing in life going on for them. You wanted to try 
 and blame that we were lower class and that was the problem 
 with the girls. I was from a middle class family and did well 
 in school. I lived the American girl dream -- or the American 
 girl life. I went on family vacations around the world, grew 
 up in a good city, and my parents are still married to this 
 day. Basically, everything you said that we didn't have in our 
 life, I did. 
 It all came down to I was told I was making $200 in an 
 hour. Being young, that was a lot of money, and I didn't know 
 any better. Sadly, you were the one with an illness that you 
 should have to go and see a doctor and also have a mentor group

 Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow

 the case, my high school agenda book of official dates. I'm 
 basing that proof that I deposited cash after leaving 
 Jeffrey's. I still have all of the information, articles that 
 I collected over the years. 
 You mentally and physically traumatized me. I went to 
 therapy, and it was the best thing I did for myself. If anyone 
 only learns one thing from this case, I hope is that money

 MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, my next client is 
 I met Jeffrey Epstein through my first 
 massage teacher, a man who took me in as his apprentice to 
 teach me a practice I wanted to learn while in desperate search 
 to find a cure for a debilitating neurological disorder that 
 have, which manifests into violent vomiting attacks, largely 
 triggered by stress. It's called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. 
 I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell. Upon my first 
 meeting of her, I wouldn't know I had been recruited until many 
 years later, when I would read it in a headline. Ghislaine and 
 Jeffrey took me in. They sent me to school. They gave me a 
 job. They flew me around the world, introduced me to a world I

 But on my third or fourth time meeting them, they 
 brought me to Jeffrey's island for the first time, and on the 
 first night there, came tapping on my door late at 
 night to inform me Jeffrey was ready for another massage. My 
 instincts told me this didn't feel right, but I got up and 
 followed her to a villa I hadn't yet seen. Jeffrey and 
 Ghislaine's villa. 
 I began my massage, trying not to let him smell my 
 fear and obvious discomfort, but before I knew what was 
 happening, he grabbed onto my wrist and tugged me towards the 
 I spent two weeks vomiting, almost to death, in a 
 Los Angeles hospital after that first encounter. Jeffrey's 
 abuse would continue for the next three years, and I allowed it

 life and had been conditioned to just accept it. 
 It took me a long time to come forward, too long 
 maybe, and all it took to bring -- and all that it took to 
 bring this man to justice has been robbed by his death. Every 
 day, every week I've spent in the hospital since, I've suffered 
 and he has won. Every job offer that's been offered to me and 
 then retracted because of my connection to this case, I have 
 suffered and he has won. Every public humiliation I have 
 endured, I have suffered and he has won. Every relationship 
 that I've had to end because of the abuse that I have endured 
 by the hands of this man, I have suffered and he has won. 
 Every woman sitting in this room today, and all of the 
 women who have yet come forward and who have not yet to come 
 forward and whose lives have been affected by Jeffrey Epstein's 
 sick abuse of young girls, we have all suffered, and he is 
 still winning in death. 
 I refuse to let this man win in death. I couldn't 
 fight back when Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me because I 
 hadn't yet found my voice. Well, I have found my voice now, 
 and while Jeffrey may no longer be here to hear it, I will not 
 stop fighting, and I will not be silenced anymore. I needed 
 him to hear the pain he's caused, what I've gone through 
 because of him. I wrote a 350-page book of all the pain that I 
 have endured at the hands of this man that I really needed him

 My name is spelled 
 Thank you, your Honor, for giving us the opportunity 
 to be heard this morning. 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 When I was introduced to Jeffrey 
 Epstein, I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of 
 teenager. I was idealistic, and I saw the good in people. 
 Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and sexually abused 
 me. 
 Something I think is very important to communicate is 
 that loss of innocence, trust and joy is not recoverable. The 
 abuse, spanning several years, was devaluing beyond measure and 
 affected my ability 
 both in my work and 
 fathom what he took 
 to form and maintain healthy relationships, 
 my personal life. He could not begin to 
 from us, and I say "us" because I am every 
 girl he did this to, and they're all me. And today we stand

 together, those that are present and those that aren't. 
 I was a victim, and it has taken me many, many years 
 to stand here and say, yes, it was me. I was a victim, but 1 
 will not remain a victim and be silent for one more day. 
 Although I think it's tragic when anybody dies before their 
 time, I'm extremely relieved that Jeffrey Epstein will not be 
 in a position to hurt anymore children or anymore women, and 
 I'm glad to be part of a group of women who are now bonded 
 forever in the trauma that we endured at the hands of this man. 
 Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Thank you. 
 MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, we had one client who was 
 not able to be here but sent a message through a letter. Her 
 name is last name, 
 And Brittany Henderson, of my office, is going to 
 read her letter as instructed. 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 MS. HENDERSON: Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Yup. 
 MS. HENDERSON: What happened to me occurred many 
 years ago when I was in high school, but it still effects my 
 life. I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be 
 held accountable, but he was not. In fact, the government 
 worked out a secret deal and didn't tell me about it. The case 
 ended without me knowing what was going on, without him being

 held responsible, without any explanation and without a chance 
 for my voice to be heard. I was treated like I did not matter. 
 Many years later, he was arrested again. These 
 investigators and attorneys representing the United States have 
 been completely different. I am still mad, concerned and 
 confused about how he committed suicide and escaped 
 responsibility again, but I know it is not the fault of the 
 judge or the government attorneys. 
 I was allowed to be a part of the process this time. 
 My attorney was able to tell me what was going on at every 
 stage because they kept him informed. Thank you for inviting 
 me. It means more to me than you can ever know. I was not 
 able to be here this time, but I know that I was allowed to be 
 and I had the chance to attend this hearing, which is helping 
 me in my healing process. The fact that I mattered this time 
 and the other victims mattered is what counts. For that, I am 
 grateful. 
 THE COURT: Thank you. 
 MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, finally, in 2008 when I 
 filed the case under the Crime Victims Rights Act, it wasn't me 
 alone. I did it with Paul Cassell and Jay Howell. 
 Paul Cassell is here today, and I think your Honor 
 even cited to a piece of -- an opinion of his from when he was 
 on the bench, and he has some remarks to make.

 MR. CASSELL: I'll be very brief because I know there 
 are others that want to speak here. I'm Paul Cassell, 
 C -a -s -s -e-1-1, previously served as a federal judge at the 
 District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach 
 crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law. 
 I just wanted to take one minute to address some 
 suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this 
 morning. I think, having heard already from these powerful 
 victims and recognizing how important giving those statements 
 will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your 
 Honor has followed exactly the right path. Legally, there is 
 one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited 
 that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that 
 opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal 
 justice system that can only be recognized if they're given 
 their day in court. 
 With all due respect to other law professors that have 
 recently written an article, I think transparency is one of the 
 overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the 
 one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take 
 today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion. The 
 Heaton case is, to my knowledge, the only reported decision on

 and, yet, we can see today that these problems recur in many 
 other cases. Your remarks today, I think, should be published 
 so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the 
 country. 
 I would encourage you to add into your remarks a 
 reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act. The Crime Victims 
 Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with 
 fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see 
 unfolding this morning is a clear example of how victims can be 
 treated with fairness, dignity and respect. 
 So I know that your Honor is wondering what is the 
 appropriate action here. Unfortunately, it seems like there 
 are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for 
 you to decide to exercise, which was to allow these victims to 
 come forward. And if there's been one positive thing that has 
 come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this 
 case, it's been your decision to allow these victims to be 
 heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your 
 decision and to encourage other judges to follow what is 
 clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an 
 example that should be followed in other cases down the road. 
 THE COURT: Thank you very much. I appreciate your 
 being here. I had no idea that you would be here when I wrote 
 the remarks, but it was clear from the literature that you are

 the leading expert formerly of the District Court of Utah, I 
 believe, and it's a pleasure to have you here today. 
 MR. CASSELL: Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Thanks. 
 Mr. Boies? 
 MR. BOIES: Thank you, your Honor. David Boies of 
 Boies Schiller Flexner. We have with us today five of the 
 victims that we represent. There are a number of additional 
 victims who either were unable to attend or are still unwilling 
 to come forward publicly. This has been an enormously 
 traumatic aspect of their lives, something that, as you've 
 already heard and will hear more today, is something that they 
 can never entirely escape from. 
 I want to, as prior counsel have, commend both the 
 Court and counsel for the Department of Justice for the 
 consideration and respect and attention that they have paid to 
 the victims. We believe that that is not only right, as a 
 matter of human dignity, but we think that is exactly what the 
 law requires and intends. 
 I will be more blunt than the Court has been, or 
 Professor Cassell has been about Professor Green's article. 
 That is an article that cites no authority, and I believe there 
 is no authority for his proposition. I entirely respect his 
 right to advocate on behalf of his client Alan Dershowitz, who 
 has retained him in connection with litigation that we've

 brought against Mr. Dershowitz, but I would have expected that 
 the Law Journal or Professor Green himself would have disclosed 
 that connection, which I think is a conflict. 
 But regardless of the appropriateness of his 
 disclosure, or lack of disclosure, I think that his article 
 opposing allowing the victims to have a voice in this 
 proceeding is inconsistent not only with the policy that 
 underlies the Crime Victim Rights Act and the very statute that 
 Mr. Epstein is being prosecuted under, but it ignores the 
 actual language of those statutes, and many other statutes, in 
 which Congress has made clear that the purpose of the criminal 
 law is no longer simply to punish the individual defendant, but 
 it is to find some way of trying to mitigate the damage that 
 has been done to the victims through restitution and economic 
 mitigation, but also through the ability to confront and to 
 have the court system and the justice system and the 
 prosecutors treat these victims as they are victims, as they 
 are human beings, and they are entitled to the respect that our 
 society needs to give every human being. So I think that this 
 is not only commendable, but I think it is what the law 
 requires. 
 In response to the question the Court asked, I have 
 discussed this hearing with my clients. I have told them that, 
 under the applicable law, the government has no alternative but 
 to move to dismiss this case, and I believe under the

 applicable law in this circuit, the Court has no alternative 
 but to grant that motion. 
 I think the current law is outdated, as the Court 
 suggested in some of its remarks. I think there will come a 
 time when either an Appellate court or the Congress will make 
 clear that, just as it's possible to continue civil cases 
 against someone after they have deceased, it is possible, at 
 least for purposes of things like restitution, to continue 
 criminal cases, but we are not there now. And, fortunately, in 
 this case, there are other ways and perhaps even more efficient 
 ways to vindicate the interests of the victims here. 
 We greatly appreciate the remarks of the 
 representative of the Department of Justice today, and we, too, 
 on behalf of the victims, are not going to stop when we walk 
 out of this courtroom. We are going to continue to seek 
 vindication against Mr. Epstein's estate and, in some senses, 
 perhaps even more important, against the people who worked with 
 him and enabled him. 
 As you have already heard, and will hear more, 
 Mr. Epstein did not act alone. He could not have done what he 
 did, on the scope and the scale of what he did, for as many 
 years as he did it without the activities and support and the 
 co-conspirator activity of a number of other key individuals, 
 and those individuals also need to bear their share of 
 responsibility, and those people need to have a reckoning as

 Thank you, prosecutors and Judge, and the 
 Court. My name is I note today I do feel 
 respected and listened to; so I appreciate that, and I have to 
 say that I commend the boldness of the New York prosecutors for 
 pursuing a man that has, you know -- and others, that have 
 clearly taken a lot from a lot of people. 
 17 years ago I knew him only as "Jeffrey." I was 
 recruited and brought from California to New York, and that

 experience for the last 17 years has been a dark corner in my 
 story, in my life, in my life story and that has been 
 definitely made worse by my own self-shame and that -- and 
 anger for normalizing all of the red flags. I feel like we are 
 conditioned to do that, and that's something that needs to 
 change. 
 So I'm here today, you know, I'm coming forward 
 because it is time to bring light to that darkness, and it's 
 time to replace that darkness with light. And I am a survivor 
 of this, and I do aim to progress further from being a 
 survivor, you know. I feel I've worked hard, quite hard, to 
 get to where I'm at now, and I'm definitely at a place in my 
 life where I will no longer cover up. I'll no longer cover up 
 what needs to be brought to light. 
 Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped 
 him are, Ghislaine Maxwell. My experience is with Ghislaine 
 Maxwell and and they definitely need to be held 
 accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one 
 another carry on this huge, almost like a system. So they need 
 to be held accountable, all of them, and I would like to see 
 that, certainly on behalf of myself and for everyone here. 
 Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Thanks so much.

 THE COURT: Good morning. How are you? 
 Okay. Thank you. My name is 
 I am a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell 
 in the dark and cruel and criminal acts they committed against 
 me and hundreds of other girls and young women for years and 
 years and years, unstopped. 
 Thank you for allowing me to address the Court and 
 speak the truth. I commend the prosecutors from the Southern 
 District of New York for the ongoing investigation and its 
 pursuit of justice for us victims. It has given me hope, and I 
 will not let go of that hope. 
 When I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at 
 Mar-a-Lago, just before I was 17, I thought I was given a big 
 break, and I'd be able to reset my life and become an actual 
 real massage therapist. My hopes were quickly dashed, and my 
 dreams were stolen. Jeffrey Epstein

 MS. McCAWLEY: The next client of ours that will be 
 speaking this morning is 
 Thank you, your Honor. My name is 
 I'm a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and 
 Ghislaine Maxwell's international sex trafficking ring. 
 I would like to thank the Court for the dignity and 
 the respect you are showing me here today, as well as the other 
 victims. I would also like to acknowledge and extend my 
 gratitude to the prosecutors from the Southern District of 
 New York for pursuing justice on behalf of the victims. 
 Please, please finish what you have started. I struggled to 
 find the words to adequately say how important your work is to 
 us. 
 For a very long time Jeffrey Epstein gamed the system 
 at every level, and when he realized he couldn't do that any 
 longer, he showed the world what a depraved and cowardly human 
 being he is by taking his own life. But we, the victims, are 
 still here, prepared to tell the truth, and we all know he did 
 not act alone. We are survivors, and the pursuit of justice 
 should not abate. Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: You're very welcome. 
 MS. McCAWLEY: Our next client who is going to be

 I had the opportunity to speak at Jeffrey Epstein's 
 bail hearing, and I really appreciate that you heard me and 
 listened to me that day. I am so sorry that others will not 
 have the opportunity to stand before him the way that I did. 
 But I'm here today to speak on behalf of my sister, 
 who could not be here. 
 Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted 
 her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women 
 here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood. She 
 risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them, 
 to no avail, and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all 
 this destruction has been wrought since that time. 
 We were deeply disappointed and disturbed by Epstein's 
 death and the fact that that was allowed to happen while he was 
 in the government's custody, and I'm encouraged to hear that 
 there will be a full investigation as to how that was allowed 
 to happen. 
 But it is extremely important, as others are saying, 
 that he did not act alone and that the other people that were a 
 part of what he did are held accountable and that that 
 investigation continues.

 I believe that we have a real problem in this country 
 with perpetrators of sexual abuse and sexual assault being held 
 accountable. There are so many roadblocks to victims being 
 heard, to cases being investigated thoroughly, and then to 
 those cases being prosecuted. And so I think this is a really 
 important signal to send a message to victims out there that 
 people will take you seriously, people will follow through, and 
 that even those in power, as we have unfortunately seen, that 
 has not been often are able to escape that, that even those in 
 power will be held accountable. Thank you.

 I was interested in meeting a friend of hers. She told me he

 the Upper East Side. She then began to talk a little bit about 
 him on our way to his house. I was at his house. I was 
 sexually assaulted by both and Jeffrey Epstein in his 
 mansion. It left me feeling both disgusted and betrayed. 
 As we walked home to the subway afterwards, she 
 continued to tell me about the man who had just abused me with 
 her participation. She seemed exhilarated from the horrific 
 experience. I was shocked and in a daze. This is a few things 
 that she had told me. She told me he went to Cooper Union. He 
 was a mathematical genius. That he had favorite girls that he 
 would take to Chanel for 15-minute, all-you-can-buy shopping 
 trips. She told me his right-hand person had connection to the 
 arts and the fashion world, and she could help me. 
 This is not my complete story. I'll stop here. I'm 
 in a good, stable place in my life, and I had decided to come 
 forward to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to 
 tell their story, or at least not yet. I feel like I am a 
 survivor. 
 Thank you, Judge Berman, for inviting victims to speak 
 today before you. We hope the government is listening very 
 closely to the words we are saying. 
 THE COURT: Thank you very much.

 individual. However, he was also a thief. He stolen, 
 childhood dreams, her innocence and her self-confidence. She 
 was 14 years old. What he could not buy, he forcibly took. 
 Why? Because he surrounded himself with a network of powerful 
 people who not only looked the other way, but also actively 
 facilitated and participated in his sexual abuse of children. 
 Jeffrey Epstein thought he was above the law, and 
 essentially he was until now. The system let and the 
 other victims down, but it does not have to end here. We ask 
 the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI to bring all of 
 Epstein's enablers and co-conspirators to justice. 
 It has taken 18 years to find her voice, and 
 again, Jeffrey Epstein has tried to silence her. While she 
 will never have her chance to face him in court, he no longer 
 has any power over her. Today, this brave survivor will be 
 heard. 
 Thank you for allowing me to be able to 
 have my chance in court today, to be able to tell you what this 
 horrific man did to my life. You can't even imagine how much 
 it affected my childhood, all the way through my adult life. 
 He robbed me of my dreams. He robbed me of my chance to pursue 
 a career I always adored. He stole my chance at really feeling 
 love because I was so scared to trust anyone for so many years 
 that I had such severe anxiety. I didn't want to leave my 
 house let alone my bed.

 Under Rule 16(a)(1)(E), I ask that you provide to us the documents produced by the FBI to 
 news media, as described in Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG). The FBI in New York 
 released to Radar Online some 1,232 pages "relating to the FBI's investigation and 
 prosecution of Jeffrey Edward Epstein." Id. at Dkt. 25, p. 1. According to a letter signed by 
 your office, 181 pages were released in full and 1,051 were released with partial redactions. 
 Id. at 2. Your office made these representations and therefore presumably is aware of the 
 documents' existence and constructively aware that their contents relate to the FBI 
 investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Edward Epstein and relate to the investigation and 
 prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. We perceive no legal basis for you to refuse to produce 
 the records; the records have previously been released to a news media outlet, "relate to" the 
 investigation and prosecution of Ms. Maxwell's alleged co-conspirator, and are in the 
 government's "possession, custody, or control." 
 We also request that your office detail when each batch of documents, by Bates number or 
 some other identifier, were released to Radar Online. The public availability of, for example, 
 witness statements and other investigative materials is relevant to this case because we believe 
 there have been efforts by certain witnesses to conform their testimony to the public 
 statements and police reports made by other witnesses. It is relevant and material to Ms. 
 Maxwell's defense to know when the FBI made any such witness statements (even if 
 redacted) or other materials available to a tabloid news organization.

 wanted, regardless of the laws, hurts me so very much. It took

 me years to tell anyone what Epstein did to me because I was so 
 ashamed and embarrassed at what people would say or think of me 
 until I found out there were other victims, girls just like me. 
 I knew I could no longer keep my silence no matter how ruthless 
 and powerful Epstein was, and still is even after his death. 
 The fact I will never have a chance to face my 
 predator in court eats away at my soul. Even in death, Epstein 
 is trying to hurt me. I had hoped to at last get an apology, 
 but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to 
 anyone. I felt let down by the people who were supposed to 
 watch him in prison. They let this man kill himself and kill 
 the chance of justice for so many others in the process, taking 
 away our ability to speak. 
 Out of all the damages and side effects that Epstein 
 caused by his heartless and selfish acts, it's very hard to put 
 my feelings and emotions into words, trying to let his 
 horrendous actions go and attempting to forgive him, has been 
 so difficult for me. Yet, as hard as it's been to come so 
 publicly forward, I refuse to let Epstein take me as a victim 
 anymore. 
 I am a survivor. The many that stand before me here 
 today that have shared the horrific experiences with this

 deplorable human being, because even though this weak, evil 
 coward tried to steal all of our childhoods, tried to steal all 
 of our innocence and tried to steal all of our means of

 THE COURT: You're welcome. 
 MS. GIBBS: Good morning, your Honor. Teri Gibbs, 
 T-e-r-i, G-i-b-b-s. For the record, I am a California 
 attorney. I'm not admitted to the New York State bar. I am 
 here to make a statement on behalf of New York attorney, Lisa 
 Bloom. I work for her firm, The Bloom Firm. 
 Lisa Bloom represents four of Jeffrey Epstein's 
 victims, Jane Doe 6, for the record, Jane Doe 7 and Jane Doe 8. 
 I am so proud of all of you victims who are here today and are 
 able to voice yourselves today. I will not and cannot comment 
 on the criminal case, or Ms. Bloom's communications with her 
 clients. 
 Ms. Bloom would like to share three of her client's 
 statements for the record. Here are the statements. Statement 
 of Jane Doe 6. 
 To the Honorable Richard M. Berman. Jeffrey Epstein 
 stole my innocence. He gave me a life sentence of guilt and 
 shame. I do not consider myself a victim. I see myself a 
 survivor. The abuse that I endured cannot continue. Let's 
 stop this before it happens to other young women. Jane Doe.

 Statement of Jane Doe 7. To the Honorable Richard M. 
 Berman. I used to be relatively carefree, inquisitive, hopeful 
 and excited about life, but my life changed because of Jeffrey 
 Epstein. My perspective on life became very dark when I was 
 unknowingly recruited by one of his agents. Jeffrey Epstein 
 ruined me. His recruiter ruined me. The far-reaching 
 consequences of that day ruined my family's lives. 
 I've chosen to remain anonymous in order to protect my 
 family from unwanted media attention. 
 I was just trying to figure out my path in life when I 
 encountered Jeffrey Epstein in his New York City mansion. I 
 cannot even begin to summarize the many detriments this 
 experience of sexual assault has had on my life. Immediately 
 following the incident, I was unable to function and be around 
 other people. My parents had to rescue me and bring me home, 
 where I became a recluse for years. 
 I was changed forever and buried my assault deep down, 
 where the darkness couldn't hurt me anymore, but of course, it 
 has always been here, lingering and affecting me unconsciously. 
 At the time, I was mired in shame, guilt and humiliation. I 
 had somehow tricked myself into thinking that I had allowed the 
 assault to happen, that I did it to myself, that I don't 
 deserve to be alive or to be loved. I believed that I was a 
 disgusting, shameful person who does not deserve to ever be 
 happy. These are the thoughts I've lived with on a daily

 Furthermore, because I couldn't tell anyone, out of 
 fear of judgment, blame or retaliation, keeping this secret 
 completely hindered my ability to uncover why these issues 
 existed for me, which could have led to a path of healing over 
 the years. 
 It is time for those of power to do the right thing. 
 It is time for compassion toward our fellow human beings to 
 reign over money, power and greed. We need to protect our most 
 vulnerable to allow them a chance at a normal life, and nothing 
 should come in the way of that. I believe that for future 
 generations, including my own children, this case will set a 
 precedent that victims must no longer suffer in silence on our 
 own or be shamed for coming forward to seek protection. 
 This case should demonstrate to those who want to harm 
 others that there will be a reckoning, and they will pay dearly 
 for the harm they inflict on innocent people. Judge Berman, : 
 thank you for from the bottom of my heart for this forum and 
 opportunity. 
 To all of those survivors who came before me, I 
 commend your bravery. There is no way I could have done this 
 without you. 
 Thank you to the public following this story, for your 
 outrage and desire for answers, which will hopefully move this 
 case forward so that victims can stop having to relive their

 THE COURT: Thanks very much. 
 MS. GIBBS: One more. Statement of Jane Doe 8. 
 In the past few weeks, i have had to reflect on my 
 interaction with Jeffrey Epstein and realized that, though I 
 have yet to put it all behind me, I am still a victim. I say 
 this because I have to come to terms with it in an effort to 
 truly get past the abuse I suffered at the hands of Epstein. 
 Pursuing criminal penalties against him and having an 
 opportunity to address the egregious crimes he committed 
 against me and other young woman would have helped my recovery 
 process. This all came to an abrupt halt when he took his own 
 life. This point of disclosure is lost. 
 I cannot say that I am pleased he committed suicide, 
 but I am at peace knowing he will not be able to hurt anyone 
 else. However, a sad truth remains. I, along with other 
 people, will never have an answer as to why. I will never have 
 an apology for the wrongdoing. And most importantly, Epstein 
 will not be justly sentenced for his crimes. Now I sit in my 
 home questioning the well-being of those girls like myself. In 
 choosing death, Epstein denied everyone justice. 
 Any efforts made to protect Epstein's name and legacy 
 send a message to the victims that he wins and that he is 
 untouchable. I understand his case may be dismissed or closed, 
 but this makes me feel as though I, and anyone else who fell 
 pry to his hands, simply do not matter.

 I ask that you very seriously consider the final 
 decision, because it will undoubtedly affect all other facets 
 of this case, including any future charges brought against the 
 recruiters or third parties to his crimes. I do not want the 
 narrative to be, Those poor girls. I want to send a message to 
 anyone who would consider engaging in similar acts to think 
 twice beforehand. I want some sort of closure for those of us 
 who relive those horrible moments where we were assaulted, 
 abused, and taken advantage of by Epstein. 
 You have the opportunity to help us seek that closure. 
 I appreciate your time and consideration and ask for your 
 continued support in dealing with this case to illustrate that 
 we, Epstein's victims, do matter. 
 Sincerely, Jane Doe 8. 
 On behalf of Lisa Bloom and The Bloom Firm, thank you, 
 your Honor.

 afford the victims their voice, because many of them have never 
 spoken before. They never spoke in Florida. They never spoke 
 anywhere. They never told their mother. They never told their 
 father. They never told their family members. This is an 
 opportunity for them to be heard. We thank you for that. 
 Your Honor, for 43 years my firm has been the leading 
 women's rights private law firm in the United States. We have 
 helped thousands of victims. And I, as an officer of the 
 court, and as a believer in the system, have tried to encourage 
 the victims to have confidence in the system that should 
 provide them access to justice that should help them to assert 
 and vindicate their rights in a court of law. It has been 
 increasingly difficult in this case for me to say to my clients 
 that they should have confidence in the system of justice given 
 what has occurred in this case, People v. Jeffrey Epstein. 
 Having said that, I am encouraged by the fact that 
 this court, essentially, in an unprecedented situation where 
 the defendant is deceased, is still affording these victims an 
 opportunity to be heard. So we thank you for that. It is some 
 encouragement. 
 Your Honor, you also asked do our clients wish to be 
 heard in reference to some of the issues that have been raised 
 this morning, including what should happen into this case. 
 Your Honor, there has been a suggestion that the court should 
 investigate the circumstances of the death of Mr. Epstein. I'm

 not going to repeat the arguments made by counsel, but I would 
 say that if there is jurisdiction, and I know that is a legal 
 issue which has been previously argued, that certainly it would 
 increase the confidence of my clients. Not just my clients, 
 but victims all over, and some are, by the way, located in 
 other parts of the world, to have the court oversee the 
 investigation. 
 We are encouraged by the sensitivity of the attorneys 
 for the United States Attorney's office for the Southern 
 District of New York and the investigation that is going on 
 with the separate team. However, and, of course, the defense 
 is also conducting its own investigation. But I do think the 
 greatest confidence would be if the court in some way would be 
 able to oversee an investigation because the court is a neutral 
 party. And although the court certainly has a stake in finding 
 out what happened to defendants who are in the custody of the 
 federal system and who should be there to face the prosecutors 
 and the charges against them, but now are not because clearly 
 the system has failed. 
 And the United States Attorney has admitted that, and 
 even before he admitted that, everybody knows the system 
 failed. Failed the victims, failed the court, failed everyone. 
 In any event, your Honor, having seen so many 
 thousands of victims of gender violence, sex harassment, sexual 
 assault, I've dealt with child sex trafficking, child

 many victims and so many failures of the system. At this 
 point, what we would really ask for is not just words, but 
 words have been helpful, but deeds, and that is very important. 
 In addition, I would like to say, throughout this case 
 is the running theme of the betrayal of trust. Betrayal of 
 trust by Jeffrey Epstein. Betrayal of trust by the system. 
 And betrayal of trust to the victims who had a right to 
 justice. And the Crime Victims' Act should not just be words, 
 it should have meaning and it should be enforced. 
 In essence, we are asking, although you may need to, 
 of course, grant this motion to dismiss, I think because the 
 court has shown sensitivity to victims and victims' needs, if 
 there is a way to at least keep the record open so that victims 
 who have not been able to be physically present in the 
 courtroom today and who have not been able to submit to the 
 court any letters, victim impact, and who have not been able to 
 secure attorneys or speak to attorneys yet -- so, for example, 
 I'll still hearing from victims who I have not been able to 
 meet with yet because they just recently are now contacting 
 me -- so if they could submit, at least for the record, their 
 victim impact statements, that, I think, would be a very 
 important assistance to them. So that would be, at least they 
 would know that what they are sharing is on the record. 
 So, in summary, I would say that they are looking

 Further, we request that you make inquiry of your "Prosecution Team," to include the USAO-
 SDNY, FBI-New York Office, and FBI Florida Office, regarding any other FOIA requests 
 that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine 
 Maxwell and produce to us the documents made public through the FOIA requests, the dates 
 the documents were produced and the identity of the recipient of the documents. 
 Finally, in your letter to Judge Nathan of October 7, 2020, you represented that your 
 "Prosecution Team ... had no involvement in the Florida Investigation." (Dkt. 63 at 4.) You 
 defined your "Prosecution Team" to include not only of the USAO-SDNY but also the FBI-
 New York Office. We believe that the FBI-New York Office participated in the USAO-SDFL 
 investigation by, inter alia, arranging for interviews and testimony of certain New York 
 witnesses between 2005 and 2010. We urge you to look again at your files to ascertain 
 whether your statement to Judge Nathan was accurate and to produce any materials that reflect 
 the involvement of the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation.

 Attorney of who may have conspired in this case, and that is 
 very hopeful, and we're hoping that everyone who may have a 
 role to this criminal prosecution will submit that evidence. 
 This is about power. This is about many victims 
 having lived in fear -- fear of the rich, the powerful, the 
 famous, fear that the system will not afford them justice. So 
 fear of not coming forward. And fear, of course, is a weapon 
 that the rich, powerful, famous, and sexual predators used to 
 silence the victims. But that is gone for a lot of victims 
 because they refuse to suffer in silence. 
 Finally, it does take courage to speak truth to power. 
 We thank this honorable court for giving these victims a voice. 
 We thank them, even after the death of the defendant, for 
 showing respect for the victims, allowing them dignity, 
 allowing them a voice. We do want truth, we do want justice, 
 we do want accountability, and we do want those conspirators to 
 face the justice system. 
 Your Honor, right now we have two of our clients who 
 would like to address the court. 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 MS. ALLRED: Then I have a couple of statements on 
 victims who do not wish to address the court. 
 As they come up, we'll give them the opportunity to

 Hello. My name is That _5 
 I was going to start this statement by saying that 1 
 was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. But that's not the case. I'm 
 still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. I'm still a victim because 
 the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling my story 
 for so many years. This lingering fear almost stopped me from 
 attending this monumental movement of strength and power. 
 I'm still a victim because I am fearful for my 
 daughters and everyone's daughters. I'm fearful for their 
 future in this world, where there are predators in power, a 
 world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep 
 enough. 
 I'm still a victim because the 17-year-old was 
 manipulated into thinking she had found someone who cared, 
 someone who wanted to help. Jeffrey knew I had nowhere to go. 
 He knew I was vulnerable, and he took advantage of that poor 
 girl, who will never be the same. 
 I cannot eat at the thought that Jeffrey Epstein -- _

 cannot eat at the thought of Jeffrey Epstein not serving the 
 time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so 
 many vulnerable young girls. He thought he was untouchable, 
 and honestly, so did I. I thought he was the most powerful 
 person I would ever meet. 
 But the end is here and here I stand becoming more 
 powerful than he will ever be. Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Thank you. 
 JANE DOE: Jane Doe. 
 Um, in 2004, when I was 15 years old, I flew on 
 Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual 
 molested by him for many hours. What I remember most vividly 
 was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for 
 me and how much he was helping me to grow. Yikes. 
 I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially 
 after he positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was 
 confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him 
 smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians. 
 After he finished with me, he told me to describe in 
 detail how good my first sexual experience felt. That was the 
 first of many lies I was forced to carry for him, the weight of 
 which proliferated my trauma. I felt powerless not merely 
 because one man wanted to strip me of my innocence, but because 
 I was the victim of a system that just enfranchises human 
 beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.

 As unjust as what happened to me was, I believe that 
 experience to be a symptom of insidious and pathological 
 violence that extreme wealth yields, a violence which 
 ultimately stays hidden through channels of extreme power that 
 serve it. 
 I first identified with this feeling the night after I 
 was molested by Epstein, when another girl and I took out two 
 of his ATVs and raised them across the mesa. I crashed mine 
 and expressed my concern to the other girl of getting in 
 trouble, which she replied to me, Don't worry, no one gets in 
 trouble for anything here. 
 Even as a child, I understood, in a sad and precocious 
 way, what I hoped we have the ability of changing now. Even 
 though Epstein is dead, there is still justice to be brought 
 for the crimes we felt powerless against concealing for him and 
 the system that supported him for all these years. 
 Thank you.

 opportunity he had. 
 I came from a small Texas town, not far from the New

 from cancer for many years. My father was devastated, as were 
 my siblings and I. My father was saddled with debt. My only 
 hope for college was to get a scholarship.

 wanted me to master the violin. After school, I would often go 
 to a mall in a nearby city. A lady approached me and saw I had 
 a violin case with me and asked if I was any good. We talked 
 about the violin, my family, and why I had clothes that looked 
 like hand-me-downs. 
 The lady told me she works for a very rich man who had 
 a home close by and that he would pay to hear me play. I was 
 told that if I could get away, she could arrange for 
 transportation to and from his place and have me back before 
 anyone knew I was gone. After some hesitation, I agreed. This 
 decision was the beginning of the end of my childhood. 
 The man who only identified himself as J or Jeff had 
 asked if I would give him a massage, and over four visits, 
 eventually progressed The money he 
 gave me further placed my young soul into a perverse sense of 
 hell. 
 I was so utterly disgusted with myself and what he did

 to me that I stopped going to see him. I had documented the 
 events with a Texas rape crisis center about the man I know now 
 as Jeffrey Epstein. 
 Epstein targeted and took advantage of me, a young 
 girl, whose mother had recently died a horrific death and whose 
 family structure had deteriorated. His actions placed me, a 
 young girl, into a downward spiral to the point where I 
 purchased a gun and drove myself to an isolated place to end my 
 suffering. 
 A voice that could only have been from my mother told 
 me, quote, I am not the victim, I am the victor, and I dare not 
 pull the trigger." I returned the gun days later. 
 Epstein is a coward. He lived his life leaching off 
 the souls of inspiring, young girls due to the fact that he 
 could never know how it feels inspired to live. Like a leach, 
 once Epstein had his fill, he would unlatch and seek out 
 another victim. 
 The only sense of justice I had hoped to see was 
 Epstein being sentenced. However, Epstein died as he lived, 
 taking the easy way out without any responsibility. 
 Your Honor, the next statement is also a statement of 
 a Jane Doe. May it please the court. 
 I was a 16-year-old virgin when Jeffrey Epstein first 
 raped me. I was naive and gullable. He was a pillar of 
 finance and a giant in the world that I was an insignificant

 at the chance to meet him again, when he told me how impressed 
 he was with my personal story and maturity for my age. 
 When I was in his presence, he made an effort to call 
 celebrities and influential people on speakerphone, like 
 Academy Award-winning actresses and super models, who always 
 answered his calls. Sadly, I was impressed. 
 He was friends with former and future heads of states 
 and every other fixture in the New York social scene and 
 beyond. He knew important people in my own world that I looked 
 up to and revered, but he spoke about them like they were sweet 
 distractions far beneath his stature. He could easily reach 
 down from his position and influence the people directly 
 involved with my daily life and future prosperity. I was the 
 perfect victim. 
 My whole life was extremely turbulent. But one of my 
 mother's greatest wishes was that all her children would 
 graduate from respectable universities. He promised me that he 
 would write me a letter of recommendation for Harvard if I got 
 the grades and scores needed for admission. His word was worth 
 a lot, he assured me, as he was in the midst of funding and 
 leading Harvard's studies on the human brain, and the president 
 was his friend.

 the complacency they did in the past, when heard repeatedly 
 over the years, but yes, an innocent massage turned sexual 
 almost immediately. 
 "Here, come. Come help me with a kink in my shoulder 
 while we finish our discussion." and a couple 
 of hundred dollars, disgust and dirty secret, more praise and 
 imparted wisdom from a godlike figure, a deliberate diabolical 
 depression of grooming and submission for his pleasure and 
 release. Even if I resisted, I was no match for him. I felt 
 powerless, ashamed, and embarrassed. I wanted to vomit 
 remembering these moments. 
 What I learned in those depraved sessions, staring up 
 at the dome ceiling in his private massage room, tore a violent 
 hole through any normal sexual awakening. I'm haunted forever, 
 having learned everything there is to know about sex through a 
 vile criminal. Every time a new molestation would bring a new 
 lesson, the progressive and constant unwinding. I was nothing 
 more than a teenage prostitute. I was his slave. 
 I had never even kissed a boy before I met him, and 
 never throughout the horrific abuse did Jeffrey Epstein kiss me 
 even once.

 I got a few hundred dollars, as usual, as he led me 
 out of his mansion with assurances that I was on the right path 
 guided by him. I lied to myself and tried to believe him. I 
 became a hollow shell. If I missed an appointment, he 
 threatened me

 I would stand there frozen in the street, terrified 
 that his assistant would call to reschedule. I made sure to 
 stay in line and not disobey him. I was in complete denial. 
 Being paid after every scheduled meeting felt routine and 
 disgusting. He was the master of the universe and the world 
 bent to his will. 
 He would eventually brag to his assistants about my 
 ability to please him sexually right in front of me, leaving me 
 feeling grotesque and worthless. Everything in my outside life 
 was falling apart. I distanced myself from friends and grew 
 further away from my family. I felt less human after each 
 ordeal. My psyche broke down completely and wouldn't let me 
 continue.

 One day I walked out of his residence and passed a 
 girl similar to myself. When I turned around, she was entering 
 Jeffrey's residence. He no longer even tried to schedule his 
 appointments with other girls in secrecy from me. Maybe he 
 never did. I was too stupid to see. 
 My world shattered. I had been so naive. I had an 
 epiphany in a calvary of desperation. I realized I was just 
 one of many young girls he had in rotation come to perform for 
 him for money. I went into a deep depression and never lifted 
 completely. I wanted to inflict pain on myself. I was 
 humiliated, angry, and suicidal. I locked myself away from 
 everything. I cut myself off forever from the world I had 
 known. 
 I endured the daily agony of knowing my life would 
 never be the same. I could never go back to New York City and 
 the wonderful life I had taken for granted before I met this 
 demon named Jeffrey Epstein. 
 This creature had manipulated and outwitted the whole 
 system, including some of the most intelligent scientists, 
 political people, prosecutors, and power players. How easy was 
 it to manipulate a 16-year-old virgin who never had a boyfriend 
 and came from a background of hardship with no parental 
 guidance or support. 
 I went to therapy and was given antidepressants for 
 severe anxiety and depression. My only solace, years later,

 was my desire to succeed on my own terms. I emersed myself 
 into my studies and was accepted to every college I applied to, 
 graduating from a top university. To this day, there is still 
 an ache in my being that I did not apply to Harvard in fear of 
 his influence there. 
 They say you never forget your first. I'm in a 
 never-ending nightmare trying to do just that. I'm forever 
 suffering because everything reminds me of that horror. This 
 new wave of worldwide publicity only worsens my despair. 
 It was only many years later that I was finally 
 intimate with a man again, and those moments were marred by my 
 actions as a child with Jeffrey Epstein. Even now is 
 impossible to separate his treachery from any care of a good 
 man. 
 For one brief moment there was elation when he was 
 recently arrested. I would finally get my chance to see him 
 again face to face and show him what I had become, that I had 
 succeeded on my own, that I was worth something in spite of his 
 abuse, and that I had surmounted the monumental obstacles he 
 laid before me throughout my entire life since falling prey to 
 him. 
 I had hoped humanity would prevail, but it seems to me 
 that he outsmarted everyone so far, and his ghost is still 
 laughing at us. I appeal to all of those just and true that 
 his evil legacy and his death not stand in the way of

 And then just one last one, and this is much shorter. 
 Statement of Jane Doe, also my client. 
 I was a model in another country when I came to the 
 United States. I was told by a booker that I needed to meet 
 with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the owner of 
 Victoria's Secret. The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could 
 help me get into Victoria Secret's world. 
 It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret 
 model. So I went one day in the afternoon and I met 
 Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman 
 introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be 
 extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would 
 probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away. 
 The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey 
 Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we 
 chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he 
 didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got 
 close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked. 
 I didn't know what was going on. It was my first 
 official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a 
 young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a 
 skirt on.

 how to get out of there. A girl outside asked me where I was 
 going and she said to be careful. She said that Mr. 'kpstein 
 knew a lot of powerful people, including Bill Clinton, and that 
 if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to 
 have any job in the industry. 
 I was so scared. I couldn't wait to get out of there, 
 and I left. I took the train home. I had spent all of my 
 savings getting Victoria's Secret lingerie to prepare for what 
 I thought would be my audition. But instead, it seemed like a 
 casting call for prostitution. I felt like I was in hell. 
 Thank you, your Honor.

 you, all of you, for your participation in today's remarkable 
 hearing. I think everybody has benefited greatly from your 
 input, and especially from the testimony of victims here today 
 and who have had the courage to come forward. 
 We have also benefited throughout these proceedings, 
 however brief altogether, from the attorneys' legal advocacy 
 and their written and oral submissions. I'm grateful to them

 Honorable Richard M. Berman 
 United States District Judge 
 Southern District of New York 
 500 Pearl Street 
 New York, New York 10007 
 Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
 Dear Judge Berman: 
 The Government respectfully writes in response to legal arguments raised by defense counsel 
 at the August 27, 2019 hearing on the Government's nolle prosequi motion. As set forth below, 
 the Court must dismiss the Indictment where, as here, the defendant has died prior to a conviction 
 becoming final. Moreover, the Court does not have the authority, inherent or otherwise, to conduct 
 its own inquiry into the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide, or to supervise the ongoing 
 Grand Jury investigation. 
 1. The Rule of Abatement Requires the Dismissal of the Indictment 
 As the Court is aware, clear Second Circuit precedent requires the dismissal of an 
 indictment when a defendant dies before his conviction becomes final, under the "well-settled rule 
 that actions upon penal statutes do not survive the death of the wrongdoer." United States v. 
 Wright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal citation omitted). This rule applies with full 
 force here, and requires the dismissal of the Indictment. See Transcript of Aug. 27, 2019 Hearing 
 ("Tr.") at 9 (Court noting that "it is appropriate to conclude that if the rule of abatement applies to 
 a convicted defendant as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the Epstein case, 
 which was still in the pretrial phase when Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction."); 
 see also United States v. Brooks, 872 F.3d 78, 87 (2d Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 171, 202 
 L. Ed. 2d 37 (2018) ("This general rule, almost unanimously followed by the federal Courts of 
 Appeals, has its roots in the common law doctrine of abatement ab initio: `everything associated 
 with the case is extinguished, leaving the defendant as if he had never been indicted or 
 convicted.") (collecting cases). 
 2. The Court Does Not Have the Authority to Conduct its Own Investigation 
 At yesterday's hearing, defense counsel posited that the "court has the inherent authority 
 to find out what happened on its watch," and asked the Court to "supervis[e], or at least keep an

 constitutional authority to supervise a grand jury investigation or to appoint an independent 
 prosecutor to investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death. The only power the 
 Constitution permits to be vested in federal judges is "[t]he judicial power of the United States," 
 Art. III, § 1, which is the power to decide, in accordance with law, who should prevail in a case or 
 controversy, see Art. III, § 2. That power does not include "'supervisory' authority" over the grand 
 jury —"an institution separate from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not preside." 
 United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 45-46 (1992); see also United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 
 I, 17-18 (1973) (holding that the grand jury must remain "free to pursue its investigations 
 unhindered by external influence or supervision so long as it does not trench upon the legitimate 
 rights of any witness called before it."). To allow a court to supervise a grand jury's investigation 
 would also likely conflict with the Fifth Amendment's constitutional guarantee of "an investigative 
 body acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge."' Williams, 504 U.S. at 49 
 (quoting Dionisio, 410 U.S. at 16). 
 The court's judicial power also "does not include the power to seek out law violators in 
 order to punish them" and, accordingly, it is "well established that the judicial power does not 
 generally include the power to prosecute crimes." Young v. U.S. a rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 
 U.S. 787, 816-17 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th 
 Cir. 1965), and United States v. Thompson, 251 U.S. 407, 413-17 (1920)). Rather, the Constitution 
 vests the power to conduct investigations and prosecute violations of the laws in the Executive. 
 See Art. II, § 2, cl. 1; Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. I, 
 138 (1976). Indeed, the Second Circuit has emphasized that judicial review and regulation of 
 prosecutorial decisions would place courts in the "injudicious posture of becoming 
 `superprosecutors,"' and would invite questions about "the judiciary's role of supervision," 
 including "[a]t what point would the prosecutor be entitled to call a halt to further investigation," 
 "[w]hat evidentiary standard would be used." Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 
 F.2d 375, 380 (2d Cir. 1973) (discussing action to require federal officials to investigate and 
 prosecute persons who had allegedly violated criminal statutes). 
 For those reasons, among many, a judge's authority to initiate a proceeding and appoint an 
 attorney to conduct an investigation has been circumscribed by Congress and the Supreme Court. 
 Only when a court order has been disobeyed does a court "possess inherent authority to initiate 
 contempt proceedings." Young, 481 U.S. at 793. But, even in the unique context of criminal 
 contempt —which is not at issue here—a court only has authority to appoint a private lawyer to 
 prosecute the contempt where the United States Attorney has refused the prosecution. See Fed. R. 
 Crim. P. 42(a)(2). 
 The precedent cited by defense counsel—the special proceeding initiated by Judge Emmett 
 Sullivan following the dismissal of the prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens—provides no authority 
 for the exercise of the court's power here. See In re Special Proceeding, Misc. No. 09-0198 (EGS). 
 In that case, after the Department of Justice dismissed the charges against Senator Stevens for 
 apparent Brady violations, Judge Sullivan, pursuant to Rule 42, appointed a special prosecutor to 
 investigate the violations. See United States v. Stevens, No. 08 Cr. 231 (EGS) (Apr. 8, 2009) (Dkt. 
 No. 375); Reporter's Transcript of Proceedings, United States v. Stevens, No. 08 Cr. 231 (EGS), 
 EFTA00020086
Page 3 
 at 46-47 (Apr. 7, 2009). But here, there is no allegation of disobedience of court order that would 
 give the court authority to initiate a proceeding under Rule 42, or appoint a private attorney. 
 Finally, it bears noting that the United States Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation, and Department of Justice — Office of Inspector General are conducting an ongoing 
 Grand Jury investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide. 
 A separate investigation would likely, at best, be redundant and may risk undermining the existing 
 investigation. 
 Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the Court grant 
 Government's nolle prosequi motion. 
 Very truly yours,

 Will you be able to gather the responsive documents for Glassman's request, as with the request from Kaplan? Except for 
 Item 8, this request seems fairly contained—and they have expressly cabined their request to not seek documents that 
 would interfere with ongoing proceedings. Please let me know if we need to discuss. Otherwise, I'll draft a letter once we

 Re: Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request) 
 Jane Doe v. Indyke et al., SDNY Case No. 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF 
 Dear Mr. 
 Please be advised that we represent the plaintiff in the above-referenced litigation who is 
 hereby submitting this written request for documentary and tangible evidence relating to the U.S. 
 Government's investigation concerning Jeffrey E. Epstein's repeated acts of sexual abuse against 
 our client, Jane Doe.' See United States a rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). We 
 believe that such evidence is currently in the possession, custody and control of the Department 
 of Justice ("DOJ") and are highly relevant to Doe's above-referenced civil matter. 
 This written request is submitted pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq., known 
 colloquially as the "Touhy" regulations. Because this request is directed to DOJ employees, 
 compliance is subject to the Touhy process, and for that reason we have not affected formal 
 service of process and hope that it will be unnecessary. 
 Summary of Information Sought and its Relevance to the Proceeding 
 Doe's civil case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation by notorious 
 pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein. It all started in 1994 when 13-year-old 
 Doe met Epstein at a summer camp in Michigan. Doe was Epstein's first known victim and was 
 To protect her anonymity, our client has elected to file her action as a Jane Doe and will be 
 referred to simply as "Doe" in this letter. The prosecutors handling the Epstein case and any and 
 all related ongoing investigations in your office, however, are aware of our client's true identity.

 subsequently abused by Epstein for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and 
 psychological trauma and distress. 
 The United States ultimately investigated and brought charges against Jeffrey E. Epstein 
 for sexual abuse of minors and violations of federal law. We believe the government's 
 investigation spanned several years and collected copious amounts of information and 
 documents regarding Jeffrey E. Epstein and his victims, including Doe. 
 As summarized below, we request the production of documentary and tangible evidence 
 relating to Doe which was obtained during the government's investigation of Epstein and that is 
 currently in the government's possession. This evidence is highly relevant to Doe's civil case as 
 it will likely provide information regarding Epstein's liability and Doe's significant damages. 
 Specifically, we seek copies of the following documents currently in the possession of the 
 government: 
 1. All photographs of Doe 
 2. All flight logs stating Doe's name 
 3. All videos of Doe 
 4. All correspondences between Epstein and his agents, employees and/or attorneys 
 and Doe 
 5. All records of purchases of airline tickets on behalf of Doe 
 6. Jeffrey E. Epstein's Trust Agreement of The 1953 Trust dated August 8, 2019 
 7. Jeffrey E. Epstein's Epstein's 1953 Trust 
 8. Any and all other documentary materials relating in any way to Doe 
 Disclosure is \\ di-ranted Under 28 C.F.R. & 16.26 
 Pursuant to the DOJ's Torthy regulations, the Deputy or Associate Attorney General 
 assesses the following considerations in determining whether disclosure is warranted:

 BOYLE , , , 
 (a)(1) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the 
 case or mater in which the demand arose; 
 (a)(2) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law of privilege. 
 This request satisfies both of these considerations. As explained previously, the requested 
 non -privileged documentary evidence directly concerns the allegations in Doe's civil case. 
 Additionally, DOD's Toithy regulations prohibit disclosure, subject to certain exceptions, 
 if any of the following factors exist: 
 (b)(1) Disclosure would violate a statute, such as the income tax laws, 26 U.S.C.A. 6103 
 and 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule, F.R.Cr.P., Rule 6(e), 
 (b)(2) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation; 
 (b)(3) Disclosure would reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified 
 by the originating agency, 
 (b)(4) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative 
 agency and the source or informant have no objection, 
 (b)(5) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
 purposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques 
 and procedures the effectiveness of which would thereby be impaired, 
 (b)(6) Disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets without the owner's consent. 
 This request does not implicate any of the above considerations. The requested 
 information is within the scope of ordinary subpoena practice and does not seek disclosure of 
 information prohibited by statute or regulation, nor information that is classified or that would 
 reveal the source of an informant. 
 To the extent any of Doe's requests seek the investigatory records compiled for law 
 enforcement purposes, Doe does not request investigatory records that would interfere with 
 ongoing enforcement proceedings.

 Doe's civil case is actively being litigated and the parties have already requested and 
 exchanged initial discovery. Moreover, a victim compensation fund has been recently 
 established that Doe may elect to participate in. Accordingly, Doe respectfully requests that the 
 DOJ expedite the production of these requested documents to assist her obtain long-awaited 
 justice for the atrocities committed against her.

 Hi M, 
 We just wanted to check in and see if you think you'll have a chance to look at the Maxwell RTC before we send it to the 
 defense. We're planning to do that on October 20, and if you have time to look at this before then, we'd really like to

 Hi M, 
 I hope all's well! Attached is a draft of our RTC in the Maxwell case. If you have time to look at it, we'd love any 
 comments you might have. 
 In terms of timing, we have to file a joint proposed RTC on October 27, so we are thinking of sending this to the defense a 
 week or so before that.

 Following up on our meeting yesterday, attached is the updated spreadsheet of all identified victims and noting which 
 ones have been contacted. Would you please review this with the FBI victim specialists to note any additional contact 
 with victims since Epstein's death? And if there are still any victims in this spreadsheet who have not been contacted 
 since Epstein's death, would you please attempt to contact them and make a note of those attempts in the spreadsheet? 
 Give me a call if you have any questions, and thanks so much for your help with this.

 Marty, 
 I got your voicemail from this morning regarding follow-up on civil forfeiture—we have a meeting at 12:30 that I expect 
 will go approximately 15 minutes and will plan to give you (or Mike, to conference you in) a call after that, so 
 approximately around 12:45 — 1:00. 
 Separately, based on the expected nolle order, and in connection with the protective order in this case, in advance of the 
 hearing on Tuesday can you please either return to the Government all discovery you received in this case and certify that 
 any copies have been security destroyed or deleted, or, alternatively, simply certify that all discovery received has been 
 security destroyed or deleted? (As to the second option, that is to say that you do not need to make additional copies of 
 electronic materials to formally "return" them to us if it is more efficient to simply delete and destroy the existing 
 electronic copies you have.) We want to be able to advise the Court on Tuesday that there are no outstanding discovery 
 obligations on either side based in connection with the protective order.

ATTACHMENT A 
 I. The Subject Devices to Be Searched 
 The Subject Devices arc particularly described as compact discs stored in containers 
 marked with FBI evidence numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, and 22, seized from the residence located at 9 
 East 71st Street, New York, New York, on or about July 7, 2019. 
 II. Items to Be Seized 
 A. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of the Subject Offenses 
 This warrant authorizes the seizure of certain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of 
 violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex 
 trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
 1. Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims 
 of the Subject Offenses; 
 2. Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses; 
 3. Any nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
 appear to be teenage girls, or younger; 
 4. Motion pictures, films, videos, and other recordings of visual or written depictions 
 of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2); 
 5. Records or other items that evidence ownership, control, or use of, or access to 
 devices, storage media, and related electronic equipment used to access, transmit, or store 
 information relating to the Subject Offenses, including, but not limited to, sales receipts, 
 warranties, bills for Internet access, handwritten notes, registry entries, configuration files, saved 
 usemames and passwords, user profiles, e-mail contacts, and photographs; 
 6. Any child erotica, defined as suggestive visual depictions of nude minors that do 
 not constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). 
 B. Review of ESI 
 Law enforcement personnel (including, in addition to law enforcement officers and agents, 
 and depending on the nature of the ESI and the status of the investigation and related proceedings, 
 attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the government in 
 this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) will create a forensic 
 image of the Subject Devices (if practicable) and review the ESI contained therein for information 
 responsive to the warrant. 
 In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to 
 determine which files or other EST contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such 
 techniques may include, for example: 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020132
• surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to 
 looking at the outside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer 
 believed to contain pertinent files); 
 • conducting a file-by-file review by "opening" or reading the first few "pages" of such 
 files in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory 
 examination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its relevance); 
 • "scanning" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted data or 
 deliberately hidden files; and 
 • performing electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to 
 determine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of 
 the investigation6; and 
 • reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry data, and any 
 other information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. 
 Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, 
 documents, or other electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section 
 II.A of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a 
 complete review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its 
 contents and to locate all data responsive to the warrant. 
 6 Keyword searches alone are typically inadequate to detect all relevant data. For one thing, 
 keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files, such as images and videos, do 
 not store data as searchable text. Moreover, even as to text data, there may be information properly 
 subject to seizure but that is not captured by a keyword search because the information does not 
 contain the keywords being searched.

 VIRGIN ISLANDS 
 In the Matter of the Application of the United 
 States Of America for a Search and Seizure 
 Warrant for the Premises Known and Described 
 as Little Saint James Island, U.S. Virgin Islands, 
 Any Buildings or Other Structures Contained 
 Thereon, and Any Locked or Closed 
 Containers/Items Contained Therein 
 TO BE FILED UNDER SEAL 
 Agent Affidavit in Support of 
 Application for Search and Seizure 
 Warrant 
 DISTRICT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS) ss.: 
 being duly sworn, deposes and says: 
 I. Introduction 
 A. Affiant 
 I. I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") since 
 2017. As such, I am a "federal law enforcement office?' within the meaning of Federal Rule of 
 Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged in enforcing the criminal 
 laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search warrant. I have been 
 employed by the FBI for approximately two years, and I am currently assigned to investigate 
 violations of criminal law relating to the sexual exploitation of children. I have gained expertise 
 in this area through classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As 
 part of my responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of sex trafficking cases, and 
 have participated in the execution of search warrants for physical premises. 
 2. I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal 
 Rules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant to search the premises specified below (the "Subject 
 Premises") for the purpose of seizing the items and information described in Attachment A. This 
 affidavit is based upon my personal knowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and 
 my conversations with other law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted 
 1 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020141
for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have 
 learned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, 
 statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in substance and in 
 part, except where otherwise indicated. 
 B. The Subject Premises 
 3. The Subject Premises are particularly described as a private island in the U.S. 
 Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, any buildings or other structures contained thereon, 
 and any closed containers/items contained therein. Little Saint James is an approximately 75 acre 
 island located approximately four miles off the southeast coast of St. Thomas Island. The Subject 
 Premises is depicted in the following photograph: 
 Based on my conversations with a law enforcement agent who has reviewed publicly available 
 satellite information, images, and drone videos, I am aware that the Subject Premises contains 
 multiple structures, including but not limited to: 
 2 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020142
a. On the northeast end of the Subject Premises, there is a single story structure next to 
 a pool. 
 b. On the southwest end of the Subject Premises, there is a single-story, four-wall 
 structure. The walls are painted with blue and white stripes. The structure has large double doors 
 as its main entrance and large windows on the three remaining walls. 
 c. On the north east end of the Subject Premises, there are multiple structures. The 
 main structure is a single story residence (the "Main Residence") with a stone exterior, a blue roof, 
 and a white detailed exterior that includes white columns. 
 d. A separate structure ("Residence One") with a blue roof and stone exterior is at the 
 back of the Main Residence, located at the end of the northeast tip of the island and surrounded by 
 coastline on two of its sides. 
 e. A second larger structure ("Residence Two) is set between the Main Residence and 
 the coastline. 
 f. Four smaller single story structures (the "Four Cabanas") are next to the Main 
 Residence and a large pool. All four smaller structures have blue roofs. 
 A third large structure ("Residence Three") set off from the four smaller structures 
 and next to the coast line is painted white and has a blue roof. Residence Three appears to have 
 two levels throughout and also appears to be at a lower elevation than the Main Residence, 
 Residence Two, and the Four Cabanas. 
 h. Behind Residence Three and along the coastline is a small roofed structure at the 
 end of a wooden dock (the "Dock House"). 
 3 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020143
i. There are two single story sheds ("Shed One" and "Shed Two") that are located just 
 southwest of the Main Residence. Shed One and Shed Two appear to have a metal-like exterior 
 that is a green-blue color. 
 j. Next to Shed One and Shed Two is a four wall structure that appears to have several 
 sally port type doors ("Maintenance One"). A second structure ("Maintenance Two") is next to 
 Maintenance One and has a white exterior with four sets of white double doors and three single 
 white doors. 
 k. Near the center of the island is a single story structure ("Residence Four") that has a 
 stone exterior and blue roof. The front of "Residence Four" has three dark double doors. 
 I. Next to the helicopter landing pad are two small blue roof structures ("Helipad 
 Buildings"). 
 m. On the west side of the Subject Premises on the coast is an approximately two-level 
 structure ("Residence Five") with a blue roof. 
 4. As detailed further herein, at least through his death on August 10, 2019, the Subject 
 Premises was believed to be owned, possessed, and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
 C. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses 
 5. For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that 
 the Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United 
 States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the 
 "Subject Offenses") . The Target Subjects of this investigation are known and unknown co-
 conspirators of JEFFREY EPSTEIN, including but not limited to

II. Probable Cause and the Initial Search Warrants 
 A. Probable Cause Regarding the Target Subject's Commission of the 
 Subject Offenses 
 6. On or about July 2, 2019, a grand jury in this Southern District of New York 
 returned an Indictment charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with violations of Title 18, United States 
 Code, Section 1591 (sex trafficking of minors); and Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (sex 
 trafficking conspiracy). A copy of the Indictment is attached hereto as Exhibit A and is 
 incorporated by reference. EPSTEIN was arrested pursuant to the Indictment on or about July 6, 
 2019, and had been detained pending trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") in 
 New York, New York. 
 7. On or about August 10, 2019, the Bureau of Prisons confirmed that JEFFREY 
 EPSTEIN had been found unresponsive in his cell at the MCC that morning, and was pronounced 
 dead shortly thereafter. 
 8. Notwithstanding EPSTEIN's death, the sex trafficking investigation that led to his 
 indictment remains ongoing. In particular, Count One of the Indictment alleged that EPSTEIN 
 conspired with others to traffic minors, and further identified three individuals who worked for 
 EPSTEIN (identified in Exhibit A as "Employee-1", "Employee-2," and "Employee-3") and 
 facilitated EPSTEIN's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, arranging victims' encounters 
 with EPSTEIN and paying victims after these encounters. The individual identified in Exhibit A 
 as "Employee-2" is a target subject of this investigation. 
 9. As set forth in Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least 
 in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in Manhattan, New 
 York; West Palm Beach, Florida; and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the present,

EPSTEIN possessed and controlled a residence, which is described in Exhibit A as "the New York 
 Residence." 
 10. As further set forth in paragraphs 8 through 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or about 
 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused numerous minor 
 victims at the New York Residence. In particular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a victim 
 arrived at the New York Residence, she would be escorted to a room inside the New York 
 Residence with a massage table, where she would perform a massage on EPSTEIN. The victims, 
 who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or 
 fully undress before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate 
 the nature and scope of physical contact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts 
 such as EPSTEIN typically 
 would also 
 Following each 
 encounter, EPSTEIN or one of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash. 
 I I. As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability 
 to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his victims to 
 recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts with 
 EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-
 recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his victims were 
 underage, including because certain victims told him their age. 
 12. One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of 
 the FBI's investigation of EPSTEIN, I have participated in interviews with Victim-1, along with 
 6 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020146
other law enforcement officers.' Based on my participation in those interviews and my 
 conversations with other law enforcement officers, I know that Victim-1 has provided the 
 following information, in substance and in part: 
 a. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on 
 multiple occasions in the New York Residence. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-I 
 was under the age of 18. 
 b. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the New York 
 Residence and numerous individual rooms within the New York Residence. Victim-I has 
 provided detailed descriptions of certain aspects of the interior of the Subject Premises, including 
 Victim -I's memory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor 
 pattern of various areas within the Subject Premises. Among other details, Victim-1 recalled that 
 EPSTEIN typically abused her in a room she described as a "massage room," (the "Massage 
 Room"), which contained a massage table, and was decorated with artwork depicting naked 
 women, hung on walls that appeared to be adorned with fabric. In describing the sexual abuse that 
 occurred in the Massage Room, Victim-1 has stated that EPSTEIN would often

13. On or about July 6, 2019, the Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate 
 Judge, signed a search warrant authorizing a search of the New York Residence. The search 
 warrant is attached as Exhibit B and incorporated by reference herein. 
 14. At approximately 6 p.m. on or about July 6, 2019, law enforcement officers (the 
 "Search Team") commenced executing the search warrant at the New York Residence. JEFFREY 
 EPSTEIN had been arrested on the charges contained in the Indictment shortly before the 
 execution of the search warrant. Based on the Search Team's observations during an initial search 
 of the New York Residence, at approximately 7 p.m., the Search Team stopped the search and 
 froze the scene in order to seek a new search warrant. On or about July 7, 2019, the Honorable 
 Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a search warrant authorizing a search of 
 the New York Residence (the "Second Warrant"). The Second Warrant is attached as Exhibit C, 
 and incorporated by reference herein. At approximately 2:30 a.m., the Search Team resumed the 
 search, and commenced searching pursuant to the Second Warrant. Later on July 7, 2019, the 
 Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a third search warrant to search 
 and seize certain electronic media stored on discs seized during the execution of the Second 
 Warrant (the "Compact Disc Search Warrant"). The search warrant is attached as Exhibit D, and 
 incorporated by reference herein. 
 15. During the execution of the warrants described above on the New York Residence, 
 the Search Team located evidence of the Subject Offenses. In particular, the Search Team located 
 the following, among other items: 
 c. Inside the Subject Premises, I observed a room that, based on my participation in 
 interviews of Victim-1, appears to be consistent with Victim-1's descriptions of the Massage 
 Room. The room contained a table covered with a sheet, and appeared to be a massage table. The 
 8 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020148
room also contained several vibrating sex toys. The walls appeared to be covered in a type of felt-
 like tapestry fabric. I further observed two paintings and three photographs hanging on the walls 
 of the Massage Room. The paintings and photographs depict nude females. One of the 
 photographs appears to depict a nude girl. Thus, it appears that the Massage Room was in 
 substantially the same condition as Victim- I observed the room more than 18 years ago. 
 d. Inside a safe in a closet on the third floor, the Search team discovered and seized, 
 among other items, several binders containing sleeves of compact discs, most of which are labeled 
 with handwriting. In total, the binders contain dozens of compact discs. Some discs contain the 
 word "Zorro" or "LSJ." Based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have 
 participated in this investigation, I believe the name "Zorro" refers to Zorro Ranch, EPSTEIN's 
 property in New Mexico, and the name LSJ refers to Little Saint James, i.e., the Subject Premises. 
 The majority of the discs contain titles that include female names. Some of the discs in the binders 
 seized by the Search Team have titles that appear to refer to trips or vacations. 
 e. In the drawer of a dresser in a room on the Fifth floor of the New York Residence, 
 the Search team discovered and seized, among other items, a shoebox (the "Shoebox") containing 
 numerous compact discs. The majority of the discs are labeled, in handwriting, with female names. 
 One disc is marked "Thai Massage." Another disc is marked "Blonde Girl Photo Shoot." Yet 
 another disc is marked "Misc. Girls Nude/Dinner--Scientists." The discs in the Shoebox were 
 seized by the Search Team. In another drawer of that same dresser, the Search Team discovered 
 loose polaroid photographs depicting young, nude females who, based on the training and 
 experience of law enforcement officers who observed them, appear to be teenagers. 
 f. In a closet on the Fifth Floor of the Epstein Residence, the Search Team discovered, 
 among other items, a box marked "women/old photos." The box contained, among other items, 
 9 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020149
approximately seven compact discs, which are labeled with hand-written titles. One disc is marked 
 "nudes 00-24." Another is labeled "Photographer--_`03" The remaining discs contain titles 
 that include female names. All of the foregoing discs were seized by the Search Team. 
 g. In that same closet, the Search Team discovered numerous black binders containing 
 what appear to be print outs of digital photographs (with file names underneath) and compact discs. 
 The binders appeared to contain, among other photographs, photographs of nude or partially nude 
 young girls, some of which are in sexually suggestive poses. Based on the training and experience 
 of law enforcement officers who observed them, some of the young girls appear to be teenagers, 
 some of whom appear to be under the age of 18. 
 16. Based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have conducted an 
 initial review (the "Reviewing Agents") of the compact discs seized at the New York Residence 
 as described in paragraphs 15(b)-(e) above (the "Seized Discs"), I have learned that the discs 
 contain approximately thousands of nude or partially nude photographs of girls or young women, 
 many of which are in sexually suggestive poses. Based on my conversations with the Reviewing 
 Agents, who have particular training and experience relating to child erotica and visual depictions 
 of children in child exploitation cases, I have learned that the Reviewing Agents believe that many 
 of the nude or partially nude images they have reviewed appear to depict girls under the age of 18. 
 Certain of these images appear to have been taken at a tropical location, and/or were labeled "LSJ" 
 either in the image file name, or on the compact disc that contained the image. Based on the 
 foregoing, I believe that a portion of the foregoing photographs appear to have been taken at the 
 Subject Premises. In addition, I have learned that some of the file names are marked which 
 are the initials o . As set forth below, I have interviewed an individual who has 
 10 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020150
reported that photographed her at the Subject Premises. Accordingly, I believe 
 that a portion of these photos may have been taken by 
 17. On or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a series of 
 articles relating to the defendant, his sexual misconduct with minors, and a previous investigation 
 into his conduct in Florida from in or about 2005 through 2008. The article included information 
 about -'s role in EPSTEIN's sexual abuse of minors. Based on my participation 
 in this investigation, I have learned that bank records obtained by the Government appear to show 
 that just days later, on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from a trust 
 account to This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests that EPSTEIN 
 was attempting to influence who might provide information against him in light of the 
 recently re-emerging allegations. 
 B. Probable Cause Regarding the Subject Premises 
 18. Based on my review of property records, I believe that JEFFREY EPSTEIN has 
 been the owner of the Subject Premises since at least the time of the Subject Offenses. In 
 particular, it appears that an entity named "L.S.J., LLC" held title to the Subject Premises from in 
 or about 1998. In or about 2011, L.S.J., LLC transferred title to the Subject Premises to an entity 
 named "Nautilus, Inc.," for $10. On the transfer paperwork, EPSTEIN signed as the "sole 
 member" of L.S.J., LLC and as the "president and sole beneficial owner" of Nautilus, Inc. 
 19. In addition, I believe that up until recently, the Subject Premises was JEFFREY 
 EPSTEIN's principal residence. In particular, I have reviewed sex offender registration data, and 
 have learned that, on or about June 17, 2019, EPSTEIN listed the Subject Premises as his primary 
 residence. At the time of EPSTEIN's arrest on or about July 6, 2019, I and other law enforcement 
 officers conducted an inventory search of EPSTEIN's personal effects, and observed that 
 II 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020151
EPSTEIN was carrying a driver's license that listed the Subject Premises as EPSTEIN's home 
 address. 
 20. As discussed herein, I believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses will be found at 
 the Subject Premises. In particular, based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who 
 have conducted an initial review of the Seized Discs, I have learned the following: 
 a. Many of the photographs appear to be labeled with file names that include "LSJ," 
 which I believe stands for Little St. James. 
 b. As discussed above, photographs seized from the New York Residence appear to 
 depict nude or partially nude young girls, and a portion of those photos appear to have been taken 
 at the Subject Premises, based on the fact that (i) some of the photos appear to have been taken in 
 a tropical location, and (ii) some of the file names of the photographs and/or the labels on the discs 
 containing the files of nude or partially nude young girls in a tropical location are marked "LSJ," 
 i.e., the Subject Premises. 
 c. Among the photographs seized from the New York Residence, the Reviewing 
 Agents identified partially-nude photographs of a young girl, labeled with the name of a particular 
 individual ("Individual-1"). The photographs appear to depict Individual-1 on a beach in what 
 appears to be a tropical location. 
 21. In or about July 2019, I participated in an interview of Individual-1, with her 
 counsel present. Based on my personal observations, I believe that the photographs described in 
 Paragraph 17(c) depict Individual-1. During the course of the interview, Individual-1 stated that 
 she met EPSTEIN in 2003 when she was approximately 17, and that she travelled to EPSTEIN's 
 properties in New Mexico, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, i.e., the Subject Premises, before 
 12 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020152
she turned 18. EPSTEIN paid for the trips, and would give Individual-1 money and gifts while 
 she traveled with him. 
 22. During these trips, EPSTEIN sexually abused and assaulted her on approximately 
 four different occasions, all of which occurred before she turned 18. Individual-1 reported that 
 EPSTEIN raped her during two of these incidents. Indivdual-1 recalled that one or more of these 
 instances of sexual abuse occurred on the Subject Premises. Individual-1 further reported that, 
 when she was approximately 17, 
 photograph Individual-1 at the Subject Premises. 
 23. In or about August 2019, I and another law enforcement officer interviewed an 
 individual ("Individual-23') who regularly performed work for JEFFREY EPSTEIN as a contractor 
 at the Subject Premises from approximately 1999 to 2005 or 2006. Individual-2 reported that, on 
 several occasions, Individual-2 observed photographs of what appeared to be nude or partially 
 nude young girls in several locations throughout the main residence of the Subject 
 Premises. Individual-2 recalled a photograph depicting and two of girls, all of 
 three whom were topless; Individual-2 estimated that the two girls in the photograph appeared to 
 be approximately 15 or 16 years old. Individual-2 knew to be EPSTEIN's assistant at 
 that time. 
 24. Based on my review of flight logs from a private jet owned by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
 I have learned that traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands at least approximately 
 once a month between October 2001 and November of 2005. These records do not include any 
 travel may have taken on commercial airlines. 
 25. For all of these reasons, I am aware that has spent significant 
 time at the Subject Premises and that evidence of her involvement, and potentially the involvement 
 asked to photograph her, and did in fact 
 13 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020153
of other co-conspirators, may be located at the Subject Premises. In particular, flight logs from 
 EPSTEIN's private jet reflect that the individual identified in the Indictment as "Employee-3" 
 traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands on approximately nine separate occasions. These records do not 
 include any travel Employee-3 may have taken on commercial airlines. As set forth in the 
 Indictment, Employee-3 scheduled victims' encounters with EPSTEIN. 
 26. Based on my training, experience, and participation in this investigation, I believe 
 that there is probable cause that evidence of the Subject Offenses, such as photographs of 
 EPSTEIN's victims and co-conspirators, will be found at the Subject Premises. In particular, 
 information provided by Individual-1, with whom EPSTEIN engaged in sex acts at the Subject 
 Premises while Individual-1 was a minor, confirms that EPSTEIN engaged in conduct relevant to 
 the Subject Offenses at the Subject Premises. In addition, photographs on the Seized Discs 
 recovered during the search of the New York Residence depict other young and partially nude girls 
 photographed at the Subject Premises, which suggests that EPSTEIN brought those girls to the 
 Subject Premises and that, consistent with the accounts provided by Individual-1, Victim-1 and 
 other victims identified in the Indictment, EPSTEIN likely sexually abused them at the Subject 
 Premises as well. Evidence of co-conspirators' presence at the Subject Premises at times when 
 victims were abused, including photographs, may also be found at the Subject Premises. Indeed, 
 as noted above, Individual-2 has observed a photograph of partially-nude young girls at 
 the Subject Premises. 
 27. Moreover, while the sexual abuse described above occurred principally between 
 approximately 2002 and 2005, as evidence recovered from the New York Residence including the 
 Seized Discs makes clear, EPSTEIN continued to maintain substantial evidence of the Subject 
 Offenses up until the time he was arrested in 2019. Indeed, as described above, in addition to the 
 14 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020154
Seized Discs, Epstein continued to maintain a "massage room" complete with a massage table and 
 various sex toys that remained similar in makeup and appearance to descriptions of the same room 
 provided by Victim-1 based on Victim-1's encounters with EPSTEIN in 2004. 
 28. In addition, I believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses, including but not 
 limited to photographs/evidence created at the Subject Premises, may be located not only at the 
 New York Residence but also at the Subject Premises because (i) the Subject Premises was the 
 location of multiple photo shoots of young girls; (ii) the Subject Premises appears to have been, 
 for the last several years and up until the time of his arrest, EPSTEIN's primary residence; and (iii) 
 given its location, the Subject Premises is JEFFREY EPSTEIN's most private residence. 
 Therefore, given that EPSTEIN has maintained evidence of the Subject Offenses, he is likely to 
 have maintained some of that evidence in or on the Subject Premises. Moreover, given that there 
 is probable cause to believe that JEFFREY EPSTEIN and others, including 
 conspired to commit the Subject Offenses, evidence of EPSTEIN's involvement in trafficking 
 minors would also be relevant to the investigation of, and any future charges against, other 
 members of the conspiracy, such as 
 29. According to international flight records that I have reviewed, a private jet owned 
 and utilized by Epstein has traveled to or from the U.S. Virgin Islands at least on or about April 
 14, 2019; May 5, 2019; May 18, 2019; and June I1, 2019. Accordingly, there is probable cause 
 to believe that EPSTEIN recently has been present at the Subject Premises. 
 30. Based on my training and experience in investigating individuals who engage in sex 
 trafficking of minors, and who sexually exploit minors, such individuals often maintain 
 photographs of their victims, and/or other erotic images of minors, at their residences. Individuals

who engage in such offenses often hoard such images in the privacy of their residences. In 
 particular, data related to their illegal activity is often stored on their computers. 
 31. In my training and experience, individuals who store nude and/or sexually 
 suggestive photographs of minors on compact discs or other external storage devices typically 
 access those images from computers and other electronic devices in order to view those images, 
 and individuals who store such materials on compact discs typically store similar files on other 
 computing devices and storage devices. 
 32. Based on my training and experience, I also know that, where computers are used in 
 furtherance of criminal activity, evidence of the criminal activity can often be found months or 
 even years after it occurred. This is typically true because: 
 • Electronic files can be stored on a hard drive for years at little or no cost and users thus 
 have little incentive to delete data that may be useful to consult in the future. 
 • Even when a user does choose to delete data, the data can often be recovered months or 
 years later with the appropriate forensic tools. When a file is "deleted" on a home 
 computer, the data contained in the file does not actually disappear, but instead remains 
 on the hard drive, in "slack space," until it is overwritten by new data that cannot be 
 stored elsewhere on the computer. Similarly, files that have been viewed on the Internet 
 are generally downloaded into a temporary Internet directory or "cache," which is only 
 overwritten as the "cache" fills up and is replaced with more recently viewed Internet 
 pages. Thus, the ability to retrieve from a hard drive or other electronic storage media 
 depends less on when the file was created or viewed than on a particular user's 
 operating system, storage capacity, and computer habits. 
 • In the event that a user changes computers, the user will typically transfer files from the 
 old computer to the new computer, so as not to lose data. In addition, users often keep 
 backups of their data on electronic storage media such as thumb drives, flash memory 
 cards, CD-ROMs, or portable hard drives. 
 C. Return of ESI 
 33. If the Government determines that the electronic devices are no longer necessary to 
 retrieve and preserve the data, and the devices themselves are not subject to seizure pursuant to 
 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c), the Government will return these items, upon request. 
 16 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020156
Computer data that is encrypted or unreadable will not be returned unless law enforcement 
 personnel have determined that the data is not (i) an instrumentality of the offense, (ii) a fruit of 
 the criminal activity, (iii) contraband, (iv) otherwise unlawfully possessed, or (v) evidence of the 
 Subject Offenses. 
 III. Conclusion and Ancillary Provisions 
 34. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that 
 evidence of the Subject Offenses, and in particular the items described in Attachment A, will be 
 located within the Subject Premises and therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize the 
 items and information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the Search and Seizure 
 Warrant.

ATTACHMENT A 
 I. Premises to be Searched—Subject Premises 
 The Subject Premises are particularly described as a private island in the U.S. Virgin 
 Islands, known as Little Saint James, any buildings or other structures contained thereon, and any 
 closed containers/items contained therein. Little Saint James is an approximately 75 acre island 
 located approximately four miles off the southeast coast of St. Thomas Island. The Subject 
 Premises is depicted in the following photograph: 
 The Subject Premises contains multiple structures, including but not limited to: 
 a. On the northeast end of the Subject Premises, there is a single story structure next to 
 a pool. 
 b. On the southwest end of the Subject Premises, there is a single-story, four-wall 
 structure. The walls are painted with blue and white stripes. The structure has large double doors 
 as its main entrance and large windows on the three remaining walls. 
 c. On the north east end of the Subject Premises, there are multiple structures. The 
 main structure is a single story residence (the "Main Residence") with a stone exterior, a blue roof, 
 and a white detailed exterior that includes white columns. 
 d. A separate structure ("Residence One") with a blue roof and stone exterior is at the 
 back of the Main Residence, located at the end of the northeast tip of the island and surrounded by 
 coastline on two of its sides. 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00020162
e. A second larger structure ("Residence Two) is set between the Main Residence and 
 the coastline. 
 f. Four smaller single story structures (the "Four Cabanas") are next to the Main 
 Residence and a large pool. All four smaller structures have blue roofs. 
 g. A third large structure ("Residence Three") set off from the four smaller structures 
 and next to the coast line is painted white and has a blue roof. Residence Three appears to have 
 two levels throughout and also appears to be at a lower elevation than the Main Residence, 
 Residence Two, and the Four Cabanas. 
 h. Behind Residence Three and along the coastline is a small roofed structure at the 
 end of a wooden dock (the "Dock House"). 
 i. There are two single story sheds ("Shed One" and "Shed Two") that are located just 
 southwest of the Main Residence. Shed One and Shed Two appear to have a metal-like exterior 
 that is a green-blue color. 
 j. Next to Shed One and Shed Two is a four wall structure that appears to have several 
 sally port type doors ("Maintenance One"). A second structure ("Maintenance Two") is next to 
 Maintenance One and has a white exterior with four sets of white double doors and three single

 OCME just completed the autopsy and the findings are consistent with strangulation/hanging. Epstein had a broken hiatal 
 bone and injuries to the left shoulder that are consistent with hanging. Per OCME, there is no reason to suspect that 
 Epstein did not hang himself. OCME will wait to finalize the report until after the toxicology reports come back, and 
 OCME has had an opportunity to review any reports of interviews of the first guards on the scene who discovered Epstein. 
 We will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thanks.

 (Case called) 
 THE COURT: Good afternoon. 
 I think I'm pretty much up to speed as to where you 
 are in the sense that I am aware that you have been before 
 Magistrate Judge Pitman earlier this morning and up to some few 
 minutes ago for purposes of presentment, arraignment, and some 
 preliminary discussion of bail. Is that accurate? 
 MR. : That's correct, your Honor. I don't 
 want to speak for defense counsel, but my understanding is they 
 expect to put in some sort of written submission and return to 
 argue the rest of the bail hearing on Thursday before Judge 
 Pitman at 2:00. That is, if your Honor refers the bail hearing 
 to Judge Pitman on that basis as well. 
 THE COURT: I might just take that bail application 
 before me. We'll figure out a time when that would be 
 comfortable for all of you. How is that? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: That's fine with the government, your 
 Honor. 
 THE COURT: I have a few items on my list. I want to 
 make mention, I'm sure Magistrate Judge Pitman did, of our 
 presumption of innocence. Even though in some of these 
 discussions, and probably more so when we get to bail, it may 
 sound like we are talking about merits of the case, it's 
 important that we underscore that the presumption of innocence 
 pertains to Mr. Epstein, now and until such time, if it comes,

 that there is a guilty determination by a jury or by the Court, 
 that he is presumed to be innocent. 
 I did have these questions. One has to do with 
 persons who are categorized as victims. I want to get some 
 assurance from the U.S. Attorney's office that they have been 
 notified about this case and that you will keep them abreast of 
 developments in this case. 
 MR. : Yes, your Honor, we are acutely aware 
 of our obligations to the victims in this case. We have 
 notified them and we expect to continue to do so as the case 
 moves forward. 
 THE COURT: Second, for my background, I am aware that 
 there are certain conditions that attach to Mr. Epstein's sex 
 offender status resulting from his Florida state prosecution in 
 or about 2008. One result is that under New York law --
 correct me if I'm wrong about any of this -- he is considered 
 to be at high risk of committing another sex crime with minors. 
 Is that a fair characterization of his sex offender status? 
 MR. : Your Honor, as the government set 
 forth in its submission to Judge Pitman, and we copied this 
 Court, it is our understanding that the defendant is a tier 3 
 sex offender in New York and that that is characterized as 
 high -risk individual. 
 THE COURT: The question that I have is what are the 
 implications, if any, of the search conducted by the U.S.

 Attorney's office over the weekend of Mr. Epstein's residence 
 on East 71st Street for the terms and conditions of his sex 
 offender status, if any? Are there any consequences or 
 relationship between what was uncovered and what he is obliged 
 to do? 
 MR. : May I have one moment, your Honor? 
 THE COURT: Yes. 
 MR. : Your Honor, in response to that 
 question, at the outset I should say that we don't have 
 particular interaction with state authorities with respect to 
 those types of notifications. We are, I would say, in the 
 early stages of reviewing those materials. With respect to the 
 defendant's obligations or potential consequences in the New 
 York State system, we certainly will notify whichever 
 authorities are appropriate. I don't think that we have a role 
 other than that. 
 I will say that they are extremely concerning with 
 respect to bail here, with respect to the conduct here, and
 expect we will get into that more in our submissions and bail 
 argument. 
 THE COURT: By the way, if defense counsel wants to 
 jump in at any point, feel free to do that? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: On that, we have not seen the 
 pictures. 
 THE COURT: I haven't either.

 MR. WEINGARTEN: I understand. It is our expectation 
 that they are ancient, that they are pre his spending time in 
 prison, and/or they are erotic pictures of adults who 
 voluntarily engaged in that conduct. 
 THE COURT: I have a question about the Southern 
 District of Florida nonprosecution agreement dated probably in 
 2008 -- is that correct? 
 MR. : It's dated in 2007, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Is that a public document? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: It is, your Honor. It's been 
 publicly filed in connection with other civil litigation. 
 THE COURT: Does that agreement bear on in any way the 
 search and results of the search that were conducted at Mr. 
 Epstein's townhouse over the weekend? 
 MR. : Not in ways that I am aware of now, 
 your Honor. Again, we are very much in progress on the search. 
 We will continue to consider any other implications beyond this 
 case as we continue to review those materials. 
 On a separate note, your Honor, I want to add the 
 government noted it is aware of its victim obligations. In 
 terms of notification, we have made notification to individuals 
 that we are in particular aware of. We also have listed a 
 phone number for victims to be in touch with the FBI, with the 
 U.S. Attorney's office. We have also put a website up and have 
 asked victims to be in touch with us through those sources as

 well. That is just to round out the notification that the U.S. 
 Attorney's office has made. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: May I be heard briefly on that? 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: For us, your Honor, the NPA is the 
 center of the universe for everything, search included, because 
 the NPA was the result of an extensive 3-year investigation by 
 law enforcement in Florida. In essence, the Feds made Mr. 
 Epstein plead to a state offense and they declined prosecution 
 federally, and that is translated in the NPA. Mr. Epstein did 
 his time, Mr. Epstein is on the registration list, and Mr. 
 Epstein paid the alleged victims. 
 As I am sure you have noted from the indictment, that 
 conduct too is an ancient history. That conduct is 2002 to 
 2005. It is our belief that this is basically a re-do. This 
 is basically the Feds today, not happy with what happened in 
 the decision that led to the NPA, redoing the same conduct that 
 was investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of 
 prostitution, calling it sex trafficking. We think that is the 
 heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our 
 defense, at least legally. 
 THE COURT: My understanding of what the government is 
 asserting is that the episodes that occurred in Manhattan were 
 not included in the nonprosecution agreement in Florida and 
 that there is a separate basis not only for a sex trafficking

 count but also for a sex trafficking conspiracy count. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: We have had good conversations with 
 the prosecutors, and we like and respect them. We are looking 
 forward to getting discovery. We are interested to see whether 
 the prosecutors in Florida, who are now under severe criticism 
 10 years later, steered the alleged victims to New York, 
 whether or not they violated their responsibilities under the 
 NPA. 
 THE COURT: Whether the federal prosecutors in Florida 
 violated their terms and conditions? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: That will certainly be germane. 
 THE COURT: Is that the point? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
 THE COURT: Got it. 
 MR. : Your Honor, if I could very briefly 
 respond to those points? 
 THE COURT: Sure. 
 MR. : I expect this will be briefed and 
 argued on Thursday. I don't intend to go into extensive 
 details about that. I just want to flag for the Court that 
 defense counsel is saying that this conduct is ancient. What 
 he is not saying is it is beyond the statute of limitations, 
 because it is not. 
 Second, the allegation that this is some kind of a 
 conspiracy within the Department of Justice is just false.

 There is no evidence to support that. The investigation was 
 begun and conducted entirely separate from any other district. 
 It began in the Southern District of New York. 
 Certainly there is evidence that was gathered that is 
 consistent with and even overlapping with the prior 
 investigation. But as the Court noted, in particular an entire 
 count of this indictment is with respect to New York victims. 
 And that is before we even get to the fact that the 
 nonprosecution agreement does not bind the Southern District of 
 New York. 
 THE COURT: I was going to ask you about that too. 
 Now that you have mentioned the topic, explain that, would you. 
 MR. : Yes, your Honor. I do expect that we 
 can brief this, but the short version is that this prosecution 
 is not precluded by the nonprosecution agreement entered into 
 by the defendant in the Southern District of Florida. That 
 agreement expressly referred to that federal district. It 
 didn't purport to bind any other office or district. 
 It is well-settled in the Second Circuit that a plea 
 agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not bind another 
 unless otherwise stated. That is even if, based on case law, 
 the agreement refers generally to "the government." Again, 
 additionally, as set forth in the indictment returned by the 
 grand jury, the substantive count alleges acts occurring in New 
 York and alleges New York-based victims.

 That is in spite of the fact that the Southern 
 District is not bound, is not a signatory to, and otherwise has 
 no connection to the NPA. And there is no evidence that we 
 have come across that the Southern District of New York was 
 consulted, asked, involved, notified as far as we have seen. 
 For those reasons and others I'm sure we will brief, 
 we don't think the NPA applies to us. 
 MR. WEINBERG: If I may reply briefly, your Honor? 
 THE COURT: Yes. 
 MR. WEINBERG: I have been one of Mr. Epstein's 
 counsel through the CVRA litigation which started in 2008 and 
 continues. In fact, our briefing is today. The NPA provided 
 him with immunity for any offenses arising from a joint 
 FBI/grand jury/U.S. Attorney investigation that led to a 
 decision by Mr. Epstein to plead to a higher state offense than 
 the state prosecutors contemplated. He went to jail, signed an 
 agreement, and has lived up to its terms 100 percent. 
 We have seen in the paperwork of the CVRA, in the 
 Southern District of Florida, in writing at docket 205-2 the 
 government's motion to dismiss CVRA, urging that the witnesses 
 there go to the Southern District of New York and essentially 
 try to motivate them to prosecute for the very same conduct, in 
 other words, the conduct that Mr. Epstein was immunized, 
 including travel between two states, telephonic communications 
 between two states. Florida immunized him for the same travel 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
 EFTA00020193
J78repsc 
 1 and telephonic communications as well as the 1591 category. 
 2 In addition, the Department of Justice reviewed the 
 3 NPA on several occasions in 2008 and essentially confirmed that 
 4 the exercise of discretion shown in Florida was appropriate. 
 5 But the most important thing is that there was communication 
 6 between the prosecutors in Florida, perhaps through prosecutors 
 7 in Georgia that took over the case because the Florida 
 8 prosecutors were recused as a result of Judge Marrah's 
 9 decisions in the CVRA case. 
 10 We know the government is relying in part on evidence 
 11 that was generated by the Southern District of Florida case 
 12 back in 2007. They have talked about message pads, telephone 
 13 records. They are the same message pads and telephone records 
 14 that reflect conduct that was exclusively 15, 16, 17 years ago. 
 15 So we do have a principal position that we will put to the 
 16 Court at the appropriate time regarding the legality of this 
 17 prosecution and whether or not it is appropriately barred. 
 18 I can say as a criminal defense lawyer of 45 years, 
 19 when there is an interstate wire, mailing, travel, and there is 
 20 one district that is conducting an investigation, you negotiate 
 21 with that district and count on the Department of Justice to 
 22 what it does every day decade after decade after decade, which 
 23 is not to go to the second jurisdiction that received the mail 
 2.1 that was sent from the immunizing jurisdiction and have a 
 25 prosecution on the very same conduct. We will be briefing

 that. 
 THE COURT: Do you anticipate that there is going to 
 be any discussion here about the legality of the NPA? 
 MR. WEINBERG: Not the legality of the NPA. I think 
 the discussion here is going to be about its scope. 
 THE COURT: From the defense, yes. You don't think 
 you expect to hear anything from the government, for example? 
 MR. WEINBERG: In the Southern District case, the CVRA 
 case, maybe two weeks ago the Northern District of Georgia 
 prosecutors, who are proxy for the Southern District of 
 Florida, filed the submission before District Judge Marrah in 
 the CVRA case totally supporting the constitutionality and 
 legality of the NPA, their discretion to enter into it, and 
 that there absolutely has never been a charge that Mr. Epstein 
 ever did anything other than fully perform his end as a citizen 
 who is expecting the benefits of a contract that he lived up 
 to. 
 THE COURT: I thought there had been some contention 
 that the way that the victims vis-a-vis the Florida NPA were 
 dealt with or not dealt with was one basis for attacking the 
 legality of that arrangement. 
 MR. WEINBERG: The petitioners are vigorously and have 
 vigorously for many years challenged, many years starting quite 
 frankly after Mr. Epstein performed his obligations to go to 
 jail and challenged it, claiming that there was no consultation

Summary of Indictment 
 The Indictment contains three counts. or "charges," against GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 the defendant. 
 Count One of the Indictment charges the defendant, with conspiring—that is, agreeing—
 with others to transport a minor in interstate and foreign commerce, with intent that the minor 
 engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count One 
 relates to multiple minor victims during the time period 1994 to 2004. 
 Count Two of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring to engage in sex 
 trafficking of minors. Count Two relates to multiple minor victims during the time period 2001 
 to 2004. 
 Count Three of the Indictment charges the defendant with sex trafficking of minors. 
 Count Three relates to Minor Victim-4, during the time period 2001 to 2004.

 prior to the government's entering the agreement. 
 The Department of Justice at the time did not believe 
 the CVRA extended absent a federal charge. The predicate is a 
 federal crime that harms a victim. The petitioners have 
 vigorously asserted a different position. Judge Marrah, in a 
 summary judgment motion, agreed with the petitioners as to the 
 fault of the government in not conferring. The issue of remedy 
 is before Judge Marrah at the present time, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Okay. 
 MR. : Your Honor, if I may very briefly? 
 THE COURT: Yes. 
 MR. : The crux of the defense argument here 
 I think cuts precisely the other way. They are arguing that 
 the Southern District of Florida has sort of sent up a flag 
 that these prosecutions could be undertaken elsewhere. That's 
 true. The Southern District of Florida has argued in papers 
 that they believed, the Southern District of Florida believed, 
 that the nonprosecution agreement was limited to that district. 
 They have said that out loud and in public and in their 
 positions in filing. 
 So certainly this investigation was not shoveled to 
 the Southern District of New York from anywhere else, including 
 the Department of Justice. We expect that the nonprosecution 
 agreement will not be an impediment, in particular because the 
 defendant certainly did not lack for sophisticated counsel in

 negotiating that agreement, which again did not include the 
 Southern District of New York. We don't expect that to be any 
 impediment at all here. 
 THE COURT: Got it. 
 This is a small item. In the pretrial services report 
 which was prepared today -- how many, if more than one, 
 passports does Mr. Epstein have? 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Mr. Epstein reported today one. Two 
 others were rescinded. As we understand it, there is one 
 effective passport today. 
 I would like to make one other point about the 
 pretrial that is extremely important. 
 THE COURT: Go ahead. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: The way it reads is that we have 
 refused to provide information about income and assets. 
 THE COURT: I didn't really read it that way myself. 
 I thought it was incomplete in some places and I thought it 
 could be beefed up, so to speak. But I imagine that in the 
 bail application those matters may be dealt with. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: Exactly. 
 THE COURT: For Mr. : In your letter you 
 describe some obstruction or harassment, witness tampering, 
 alleged, by Mr. Epstein. That, I take it, is going to be 
 included in any response or any bail submission made by the 
 government?

 MR. : Your Honor, I think we addressed that 
 in our initial submission. To the extent defense counsel has a 
 response to it, we will evaluate that response and see whether 
 additional submission from the government is required or 
 appropriate. 
 THE COURT: I think that's it for me in terms of 
 questions that I might have had. 
 There is, of course, a conspiracy charge here, one of 
 the two counts. It may be early in your investigation to know. 
 Do you anticipate that there may be other defendants in this 
 proceeding? 
 MR. : Your Honor, we don't expect any 
 imminent superseding indictments in this case. It certainly is 
 possible down the road. 
 MR. WEINGARTEN: May I make one point, your Honor? 
 These obstruction allegations we find very nettlesome and 
 bothering. My understanding is that the Feds and Mr. Epstein's 
 attorneys back in the early 2000s, or 2007 and 8, when they 
 were negotiating were looking desperately for an appropriate 
 statute. They finally settled on a state statute that Mr. 
 Epstein pled to. We all know how unusual that is. There was 
 some consideration of a federal statute, including obstruction. 
 So lawyers in good faith were having discussions back 
 and forth whether or not they could squeeze Mr. Epstein's 
 conduct into a particular statute, and they concluded they

 couldn't because the facts didn't fit. That is my 
 understanding of how those obstruction discussions arose. 
 THE COURT: Got it. 
 In terms of bail application, it would be helpful, and 
 maybe this is your anticipation, to file written submissions. 
 If you could do that. What I'm getting to is Thursday 
 afternoon is not a good time, in my opinion. I would prefer to 
 do it, if you would go along with this, Monday morning at, say, 
 9:30. That would give everybody more time to make these

 and propose a package. Then the government would like an 
 opportunity to reply to that submission. 
 The parties would be happy to make those deadlines 
 Thursday and Saturday respectively. However, we are also happy 
 to back that up a little bit if the Court prefers not to 
 receive the government's submission over the weekend. We could 
 do an earlier deadline on Thursday for defense and a late 
 Friday deadline for the Court from the government, depending on 
 what the Court prefers. 
 THE COURT: I was going to propose defense Thursday at 
 noon. Is that okay to get your submission in? 
 MR. WEINBERG: We can do that, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Thanks. 
 And if you could respond Friday by 5:00 p.m. 
 MR. : We will, your Honor. Thank you. 
 THE COURT: Then we can have oral presentations. I 
 take it everybody wants to have oral presentations in addition 
 to the written. I'll set aside as much time as we need on the 
 15th at 10:00. 
 I ask the government if there is a speedy trial issue 
 or application that takes us to Monday at 10:00 a.m. 
 MR. : Yes, your Honor. The government asks 
 that speedy trial time be excluded until Monday. We do expect 
 to begin the process of working on producing discovery, to 
 include discussions with defense counsel about a protective

 order. I think, frankly, the outcome of that will be effected 
 by the coming week. But we do expect to have those 
 conversations and therefore request that speedy trial time be 
 excluded until Monday. 
 THE COURT: I am going to find under 18 United States 
 Code 3161 that the request for adjournment, joined in by both 
 sides, to and including Monday the 15th at 10:00 a.m., is 
 appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned time from 
 speedy trial calculations. 
 I further find that the exclusion is designed to 
 prevent any possible miscarriage of justice to facilitate these 
 proceedings and, initially at least, so that counsel has time 
 to prepare written bail submission and to guarantee effective 
 representation of and preparation by counsel for both sides. 
 Thus, the need for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh 
 the interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial 
 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 3161(h) (7)(A) and (B). 
 Does anybody want to add anything to today's session?

 THE COURT: So, today's conference was scheduled at 
 the end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date. 
 I thought that we would devote at least the -- well, probably 
 most of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in 
 this case, and I asked the lawyers to get together and see if 
 they could come up with a mutually agreeable schedule, which 
 would include trial date, motion practice, discovery, etc. 
 Does anybody want to let me know how you made out? 
 MS. §§§: Yes, your Honor. 
 We have conferred with defense counsel and talked 
 about a proposed schedule for this case. So we are prepared to 
 propose to the court today a schedule for discovery, for 
 discovery -related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are 
 also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date. 
 THE COURT: Okay. What have you got in mind? 
 MS. III: So, with respect to discovery, we would 
 propose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete 
 discovery, with one exception. There are materials from 
 devices seized from the defendant's residence in New York, and 
 the F.B.I. is beginning the process of reviewing that data. 
 In discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun 
 to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. It's 
 possible that process may take longer than October 31. But 
 aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting 
 a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery.

 For discovery-related motions, we would propose that 
 the defense file any motions that they are aware of relating to 
 discovery, to include motions relating to the nonprosecution 
 agreement, by September 13 --
 THE COURT: By when? 
 MS. September 13, your Honor. 
 -- that the government be permitted to respond by 
 October 4; with any reply due on October 11, as necessary. 
 Of course we understand that if the defense comes to 
 have additional motions related to discovery based on the 
 ongoing discovery process that we will confer and propose an 
 additional briefing schedule beyond that, as necessary. But 
 with respect to motions that the defense is already aware of, 
 including the NPA, that is the schedule that we would propose 
 at this time. 
 Regarding pretrial motions, your Honor, we would 
 propose that the defense file their motions by January 10, that 
 the government be permitted to respond by February 10, and that 
 any replies be due on or before February 24. 
 THE COURT: Got it. 
 MS. ill: And finally, your Honor, we are prepared to 
 discuss a trial date in this case. The government is asking 
 the court to set a trial date in this matter. We would propose 
 that the court schedule this matter for trial in June of next 
 year, and we estimate that the trial would take approximately

 EFTA00020205
Burden of Proof and Multiple Counts 
 In a moment, I will describe those three counts in more detail. Before I do, however, let 
 me explain that the Government has the burden of proving the defendant's guilt on each count by 
 a preponderance of the evidence. That means that the Government must show that it is more 
 likely than not that the defendant is guilty of each count. 
 You must consider each count separately and return a separate verdict of guilty or not 
 guilty for each. Whether you find the defendant guilty or not guilty as to one offense should not 
 affect your verdict as to any other offense charged. 
 You have no doubt heard that a defendant's guilt in a criminal case must be proved 
 beyond a reasonable doubt. That is not the standard we are applying in today's exercise. As I 
 said, the question for you today is whether it is more likely than not that the defendant is guilty 
 of each count.

 four to six weeks, and so that trial date would carry into 
 July. And I understand that the defense has some comments 
 about that proposal, but that's the government's proposal with 
 respect to a trial date. 
 THE COURT: Okay. Let me hear from the defense. 
 Do I understand it correctly that, with the exception 
 of the trial date, those dates are agreeable? 
 MR. WEINBERG: Those dates are agreeable, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: Counsel, whatever you wish to add, that 
 would be fine. 
 MR. WEINBERG: We would ask the court to set a 
 preliminary trial date immediately after Labor Day. I say 
 preliminary because we want time to assess Mr. Epstein's

 MR. WEINBERG: Yes.

 discovery coming in October, Judge. I apologize for being

 make that recommendation -- we haven't received the discovery 
 yet. Understandably, it is coming, and I'm not in any way 
 contesting that there has been a delay, but we haven't had an 
 opportunity to start reviewing what the government has 
 predicted to be over a million pages of discovery with 
 Mr. Epstein and to assess Mr. Epstein's ability to exercise his 
 constitutional right, while at MCC, in assisting counsel 
 prepare for a very difficult case that addresses events that it 
 is alleged occurred 14 to 17 years ago. 
 THE COURT: Okay. 
 MR. WEINBERG: So, we need time to receive a million 
 pages of discovery and to prepare to defend a four- to six-week 
 trial, when a lot of the immediate attention is going to be on 
 the very unique and complex constitutional issues connected to 
 the nonprosecution agreement, our contention that the 
 government's allegations are inextricably intertwined and 
 constitutionally barred by the NPA. There are double jeopardy 
 issues both connected to the conspiracy count, which looks to 
 be an overlap with one of the charges that was expressly within 
 the immunity provisions in the NPA. We are going to be 
 spending a lot of time, and that's why I agreed with the 
 government that we should make early discovery motions on the 
 NPA-related issues, on double-jeopardy-related issues, so that 
 we could not only facially brief the motion to dismiss, but

 have the discovery, the subfacial discovery, if you will, so 
 that we could make a comprehensive briefing along the lines of 
 the schedule for motions. 
 THE COURT: That's what I was going to suggest, if 
 there is a time period when you could put it all together, as 
 it were, and there is a lot of flexibility. So I will leave 
 these dates, you know, for now. 
 With respect to the trial date, I could accommodate 
 either June or September of 2020. The issue is not so much as, 
 from my point of view, when you are all ready, but what part of 
 the calendar I block out. So is it realistic to block out time 
 in June? 
 MR. WEINBERG: I think it is -- I don't want to have 
 the court block out a six-week time and then come to the court 
 in March and say we need a continuance and risk a September 
 date. 
 THE COURT: Got it. Okay. So a September date, you 
 are saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic. 
 MR. WEINBERG: Thirteen months sounds like the amount 
 of time that we would ordinarily need to prepare a case of this 
 magnitude and scope. 
 THE COURT: All right. That is fine for me. 
 Just while we are taking care of details, a speedy 
 trial issue or application? Why don't we extend it to 
 September of 2020?

 MR. WEINBERG: This case certainly meets all of the 
 statutory criteria for complexity and we would agree to that 
 extension, Judge. 
 MS. §§§: Your Honor, may I briefly be heard with 
 respect to the trial date? 
 THE COURT: Oh, sure. You know, it does sound like it 
 is kind of premature, but I'm happy to hear you. It is often 
 the defense that is ahead of the government, or not often, but 
 equally, but here it is the other way around. So if the 
 defense is not ready, it would be my practice to defer to the 
 defense, but I don't know that it is fixed in stone either way. 
 But, sure, I am happy to hear you. 
 MS. ill: Your Honor, by way of background, we had 
 initially proposed to the defense a May trial date. We think 
 that there is a public interest in bringing this case to trial 
 as swiftly as manageable. We understand, given their concerns 
 in wanting to have more time, we proposed a date in June as a 
 compromise position. We understand if the defense has 
 indicated that they need additional time. We are sensitive to 
 those concerns. But we do have a concern about the notion of 
 setting a September trial date and that that trial would be 
 preliminary or as a placeholder. Thirteen months is a 
 considerable amount of time for a case of this nature to go to 
 trial; and, again, given the time period of the charged conduct 
 and the length of time that's passed, we do think that there is

 a public interest in scheduling a fixed trial date in this 
 case. Of course we understand if issues arise in the interim, 
 we will address that as it occurs, but we do think it makes 
 sense at this juncture to set a firm trial date. We don't 
 think that any delay in this case is in the public interest. 
 THE COURT: Counsel. 
 MR. WEINBERG: We think that the delay in bringing 
 this charge, your Honor, the natural corollary of that is to 
 make it more difficult, not easier, for us to defend 
 Mr. Epstein. For instance, there are certain sealed files for 
 potential witnesses that we would have to go to other courts to 
 seek to unseal. There is an NPA to litigate. This case is not 
 your ordinary 1591 case. A case of four to six weeks is not 
 the ordinary amount of time the government takes to prosecute, 
 whether it is old or new cases. We need 13 months. I'm trying 
 to make a principled argument, Judge, that that would be a 
 schedule that we would try our best to meet, conditioned on our 
 ability to work with Mr. Epstein under the current conditions. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 THE COURT: Okay. 
 So, we are going to monitor the case from now until 
 then anyway, so I think everybody will be in a better position 
 to know what is realistic with respect to a trial date. I will 
 exclude time from today through, let's say, June 8, but that, 
 of course, is without prejudice to hearing from the defense and 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
 (212) 805-0300

 the government as to actually where things stand. Long before 
 then we will know. So we will have a conference, or several,

 between now and then. Let's see where everybody is as the 
 months go by, and then we will know when we can effectively 
 hold the trial. 
 So I am going to find, under 18 United States Code 
 3161, that the request for adjournment, joined in by both 
 sides, is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned 
 time from Speedy Trial calculations. I further find that the 
 exclusion is designed to prevent any possible miscarriage of 
 justice, to facilitate these proceedings, including extensive 
 pretrial preparation, and to guarantee effective representation 
 of and preparation by counsel for both sides, and thus the need 
 for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of 
 the public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 
 United States Code E. 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B). So that exclusion 
 goes to June 8, 2020 preliminarily. 
 Counsel, is it your thought that these motions would 
 be on submission or did you want to have oral argument with 
 respect to any aspect of them? 
 MR. WEINBERG: We would seek oral argument, your 
 Honor. 
 THE COURT: So let's set October 28, 2019 for oral 
 argument, and I am tentatively reserving some time on my 
 calendar, as I said before, on June 8, 2020, but I will have

 much better feel for where things are long before that and 
 certainly I would say on October 28 we would have a much 
 clearer picture of how things stand. 
 So there you have it. Did you have -- go ahead. 
 MS. §§§: Just to clarify, your Honor, what time would 
 the court like the parties to appear on October 28? 
 THE COURT: 10 a.m. 
 MS. §§§: Thank you, your Honor. 
 THE COURT: And the June 8 date is 9 a.m. Okay? 
 MR. WEINBERG: Would your Honor want to schedule an 
 argument on the substantive motions that will be fully briefed 
 before the court on February 24? 
 THE COURT: Yup. 
 So let's schedule that oral argument for March 12, 
 2020, at 10 a.m. 
 Great. So anything anybody else has to talk about?

 you.

 I just had positive conversations with and (and =) -= had understood that FBI was getting their own 
 hard drive to transfer the data, which obviously makes sense. response to email was to just have 
 order a 12 TB drive, which she expects will get to next week. I also think that's a better option than the 2 TB 
 drive that says we have available on short notice, given that we expect the data to be somewhere around 20-40 TB 
 (the capacity of the devices we seized is around 40-50 TB). 
 I take it from email that he's otherwise ready to give us the data, although that certainly would be a new 
 development, but we're obviously hopeful that's the case. The key question then will be whether what we get from him 
 this time is actually usable. If it's not, I think at that point it will make sense to just have BRG do it — they can physically 
 take the devices themselves and do it. We had asked about that possibility from the beginning and CART was resistant, 
 but given the past nine months I think we should do it if necessary. But, hopefully the intervention of higher-ups solves 
 the problem and we can get the data in the next couple weeks, which would be great.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and

 needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what

 Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
 can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
 levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
 week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
 what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Count One: Conspiracy to Transport Minors 
 As I mentioned, Count One of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiracy to 
 transport minors between 1994 and 2004. 
 In order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of conspiracy, the 
 Government must establish each of the following elements: 
 First, the existence of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment; that is, as to Count One, a 
 conspiracy to transport a minor with intent that the minor engage in sexual activity for which a 
 person can be charged with a criminal offense. You should know that a conspiracy just means that 
 the defendant you are considering agreed with at least one other person to violate the law. 
 Second, that the defendant intentionally and knowingly became a member of the 
 conspiracy. That is, she knowingly participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its object 
 and with an intent to further the aims of the conspiracy. The defendant's mere presence at the 
 scene of the alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, 
 mere knowledge or acquiescence, without participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In 
 other words, knowledge without agreement and participation is not sufficient. On the other 
 hand, it is not necessary for the Government to show that a defendant was fully informed as to all 
 the details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part, and it does not 
 matter whether the defendant's role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or 
 different in nature or in length of time from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was 
 herself a participant. 
 With respect to Count One, in order to sustain the charge that the defendant conspired to 
 transport an individual with intent that the person engage in sexual activity for which a person can 
 be charged with a criminal offense, the Government must prove that the purpose of the conspiracy 
 was to transport an individual with intent that the individual engage in sexual activity for which a

Thanks for this update — we'll take a look and circle back if any questions. 
 Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be 
 transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable 
 format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices —
 so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to 
 get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
 And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think we've 
 gotten any updates on that status in the past few weeks, and we're eager to be able to start reviewing.

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
 the following loose storage devices: 
 EFTA00020216
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
 o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
 o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
 o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
 o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
 The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
 The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
 match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

 Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
 unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
 convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
 size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
 file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
 in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
 iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will

 Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason.

 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool

person can be charged with a criminal offense, which contains three elements: 
 First, that the defendant knowingly transported an individual in interstate or foreign 
 commerce. This means that the Government must prove that the defendant knew both that she 
 was causing the individual to be transported, and that the individual was being transported in 
 interstate commerce. The Government does not have to prove that the defendant personally 
 transported the individual across a state line or international border. It is sufficient to satisfy this 
 element that the defendant acted through an agent or was engaged in the making of the travel 
 arrangements, such as by purchasing tickets necessary for the individual to travel as planned. 
 Second, that the defendant transported the individual with the intent that the individual 
 engage in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count 
 One alleges sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the criminal 
 law of New York. Specifically, a person commits sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree 
 when he or she subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter's consent. Under New 
 York law, "sexual contact" means any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person 
 for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party. Also under New York law, a person 
 less than seventeen years old is incapable of consent. 
 Third, the individual must be less than seventeen years old, and the defendant must know 
 that the individual is less than seventeen years old. 
 It is not a defense to the crime of sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree that the minor

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
 on the rest.

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
 to schedule a productive meeting. 
 thanks all,

 • (NY) (FBI) 
 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 EFTA00020226
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
 modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 3) 
 • The cover page of both days of testimony (so the caption and date shows) 
 • The following five excerpts (I think you should be able to just control-F to locate): 
 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls 
 for sexual massages? If you know. 
 A. I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Q. List all the people under the age of 18 that you interacted 
 with at any of Jeffrey's properties? 
 A. I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than 
 obviously who was 17 at this point. 
 Q: Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in 
 sexual activities in Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach house? 
 A: No, not that I recall. . . . 
 Q. Do you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or 
 devices used in sexual activities? 
 EFTA00020228
A. No. 
 4) 
 5) 
 4• Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have 
 identified as having been involved in three-way sexual 
 activities, with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual 
 activities? 
 A. I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with 
 anyone when I was with him other than myself. 
 4. I want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that 
 in the 1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein 
 was having sexual activities with anyone other than yourself 
 and the blond and brunette on those few occasions when they 
 were involved with you? 
 A. That is my testimony, that is correct. 
 4• Is it your testimony that you've never given anybody a 
 massage? 
 A. I have not given anyone a massags
 4• You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your 
 testimony? 
 A. That is my testimony.

Count Two: Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking 
 Count Two charges the defendant with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking between 2001 
 and 2004. 
 As with Count One, in order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of 
 conspiracy, the Government must establish the following elements: 
 First, the existence of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment; that is, as to Count Two, a 
 conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. 
 Second, that the defendant intentionally and knowingly became a member of the 
 conspiracy. That is, she knowingly participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its object 
 and with an intent to further the aims of the conspiracy. 
 With respect to Count Two, in order to sustain the charge that the defendant conspired to 
 commit sex trafficking, the Government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
 purpose of the conspiracy was to commit sex trafficking, which contains four elements: 
 First The defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or 
 obtained a person. Those terms have their ordinary, everyday meanings. 
 Second: The defendant knew that the person was under the age of eighteen years. 
 Third: The defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a commercial sex 
 act. The term "commercial sex act" means "any sex act, on account of which anything of value 
 is given to or received by any person." The thing of value may be money or any other tangible 
 or intangible thing of value that may be given to or received by any person, regardless of whether 
 the person who receives it is the person performing the commercial sex act. It is not required 
 that the person actually have performed a commercial sex act, and it is not a defense that the 
 person consented. 
 Fourth: The defendant's acts were in or affecting interstate commerce. I instruct you

 Dear 
 The enclosed information is provided by the United States Department of Justice Victim Notification System 
 (VNS). As a victim witness professional, my role is to assist you with information and services during the 
 prosecution of this case. You have been designated to receive notifications on behalf of the following victim(s) 
 (or potential victims) identified by law enforcement during the investigation of the case: 
 Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested and charged as the result of a criminal investigation conducted by 
 the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. These charges arise out of an 
 investigation into potential co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein. The main charge is categorized as Project Safe 
 Childhood. Additional information reeardin. the case is set forth below. The lead prosecutors on the case are 
 Victim's Rights 
 Although the current charges against Maxwell may not contain allegations involving you personally, the 
 Southern District of New York previously identified you as a victim or potential victim in a related case involving 
 Jeffrey Epstein. 
 Victims of all crimes under federal investigation are entitled to services under the Victims' Rights and 
 Restitution Act (VRRA), including notification of court events. For further details, please refer to Title 34 United 
 States Code section 20141 or the VRRA link posted at https://www.notify.usdoj.gov. 
 Although you may not have been identified as a victim of the specific conduct charged in the Indictment 
 against Maxwell, for your awareness, this letter provides details regarding the rights of crime victims in federal 
 cases. Now that charges have been filed in federal court, victims of the charges filed are, in addition, entitled 
 to the following rights, according to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Title 18 United States Code section 3771: 
 (1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely 
 notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or 
 escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the 
 court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be 
 materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at 
 any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) 
 The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (6) The right to full and timely

 treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy; (9) The right to be informed in a 
 timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement; and (10) The right to be informed of the 
 rights under this section and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act 
 of 1990 (34 U.S.C. 20141(c)) and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights 
 Ombudsman of the Department of Justice. If you want to inform the prosecutors of your views regarding any 
 aspect of the case, please contact one of the prosecutors listed above or me at 
 Please understand that these rights apply only to victims of the specific counts charged in federal court, and 
 thus you may not be able to exercise all of these rights if the crime of which you are a victim is not within the 
 scope of the Indictment. 
 Because you have not been identified as a victim of the charges filed against Maxwell. we will not provide 
 you with additional individualized notifications about this specific case unless you request such 
 notifications. If you wish to receive ongoing notifications regarding this case, please contact me a 
 Even if you do not receive individualized notifications regarding this case, we will make our best efforts to 
 ensure you are provided the rights and services to which you are entitled. You may contact the Victim/Witness 
 Coordinator at the office listed above if you have questions about the progress of your case, your rights or the 
 services to which you are entitled, or how you can assert them during the proceedings. If you believe that a

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 We write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to 
 accept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in 
 this case for Ms. Maxwell's use at the MDC. 
 In an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell's review of the discovery, defense counsel have 
 created a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by 
 the government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is 
 not permitted to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master 
 drives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one 
 place and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November 18, 
 2020 production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which 
 contains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and 
 other formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and 
 eliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her 
 review. 
 Defense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the 
 MDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permitted to accept 
 hard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We have conferred with 
 the government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to 
 the Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government 
 requested, however, that the Court allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their 
 objections to the Court.

 have.

Count Three: Sex Trafficking of Minor Victim-4 
 Count Three charges the defendant with the sex trafficking of Minor Victim-4 between 
 2001 and 2004. I have just reviewed the four elements of sex trafficking with you. In order to 
 satisfy its burden of proof with respect to Count Three, the Government must establish by a 
 preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed those elements in the sex trafficking 
 of Minor Victim-4. 
 In addition, you may find the defendant guilty of Count Three under a them of 
 liability called "aiding and abetting," which permits a defendant to be convicted of a specified 
 crime if the defendant, while not herself committing the crime, assisted another person or 
 persons in committing the crime. To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that 
 the Government prove that the defendant willfully and knowingly associated herself in some way 
 with the crime committed by the other person and willfully and knowingly sought by some act to 
 help the crime succeed.

 Defendant.

 DOC N: 
 DATE FILED: 4/16/21 
 20-cr-330 (AJN) 
 OPINION & ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
 with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 
 1994 to 1997. The Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, 
 which contained only small, ministerial corrections. The SI superseding indictment included 
 two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of 
 the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two 
 counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to 
 begin on July 12, 2021. 
 Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Si superseding 
 indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those 
 motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking 
 count and another related conspiracy count. 
 This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than 
 those seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and 
 this Opinion, deal exclusively with the S 1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues 
 EFTA00020261
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 34 
 related to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies 
 Maxwell's motions to dismiss the SI superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her 
 motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite 
 discovery. 
 The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the 
 pages that follow: 
 • Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between 
 Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court 
 concludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses. 
 • Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the 
 Government brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly 
 delay in bringing them. 
 • Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the 
 alternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The 
 Court concludes that the charges are specific enough. 
 • Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony 
 responded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that 
 these issues are best left for the jury. 
 • Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can 
 proceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will 
 try the perjury counts separately. 
 • Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous 
 and to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that 
 these motions are premature before trial. 
 • Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories 
 of evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will 
 order Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule. 
 • Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than 
 Manhattan, returned the  Si superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhattan 
 returned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 3 of 34 
 I. Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution 
 In September 2007, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey 
 Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement ("NPA") with the Office of the United States 
 Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142 at 1-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to 
 plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen 
 months in a county jail. Id. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to charge him 
 with federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his 
 conduct between 2001 and 2007. Id. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of 
 his "potential co-conspirators." Id. 
 As a recent report from the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility 
 observed, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy. 
 OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 204-3, at x, 80, 175, 179, 260-61. The U.S. Attorney's 
 promise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal 
 practice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added "with little 
 discussion or consideration by the prosecutors." Id. at 169, 185. The report concluded that the 
 U.S. Attorney's negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct, 
 but nonetheless reflected "poor judgment." Id. at 169. 
 Only the NPA's effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell 
 contends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of 
 Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal 
 limitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second 
 Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
 York. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment. 
 3 
 EFTA00020263
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 4 of 34 
 A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the 
 Southern District of New York 
 United States Attorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Attorney makes a 
 promise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal 
 government to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); United States v. 
 Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558 (2d Cir. 1996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Attorney for 
 the Southern District of Florida had the power to bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
 of New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit 
 precedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not. 
 In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: "A plea agreement binds only the 
 office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
 affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction." 771 F.2d 670, 672 
 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea 
 agreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying 
 Annabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from 
 this ordinary practice from an agreement's use of phrases like "the government" or "the United 
 States." United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. 
 Gonzalez, 93 F. App'x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004). Those are common shorthand. A plea 
 agreement need not painstakingly spell out "the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
 and -Such District" in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where 
 signed. 
 Maxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA 
 dealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Attorneys in other 
 districts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in 
 4 
 EFTA00020264
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 5 of 34 
 its entirety, reads as follows: "the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
 charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein." Dkt. No. 142-1 at 5. Under Annabi, 
 Salatneh, and Gonzalez, a statement that "the United States" agrees not to prosecute implies no 
 restriction on prosecutions in other districts. 
 Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of 
 Florida. The first states that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer 
 "prosecution in this District" if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The 
 second states that no prosecution "will be instituted in this District, and the charges against 
 Epstein if any, will be dismissed" after he fulfills the agreement's conditions. Maxwell contends 
 that the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any 
 geographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA's scope was expressly 
 limited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone "affirmatively 
 apparent", Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672,—that the parties intended to drastically expand the 
 agreement's geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators 
 without clearly so saying. 
 Without an affirmative statement in the NPA's text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation 
 history. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA 
 between the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United 
 States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). She alleges that officials in the U.S. 
 Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA 
 from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and communicated with attorneys in other 
 districts. Any involvement of attorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have 
 been minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information

 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC legal counsel responding to 
 the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; 
 see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 
 7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally 
 respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See 
 Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC legal 
 counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to summon the 
 Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt. No. 75. 
 Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
 continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of Ms. 
 Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, including 
 legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The updates shall 
 also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. 
 The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 
 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant 
 EFTA00018016
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 6 of 34 
 about the NPA's negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence 
 that the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA. The OPR report 
 reflects that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was 
 signed when Epstein tried to get out of it. OPR Report at 103. Other documents show that 
 attorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory 
 assistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 204-2. Nor would direct approval of 
 the NPA by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General change the meaning of its terms. No 
 evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-
 conspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it does not matter who did or did not 
 approve it. 
 Second Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only 
 the U.S. Attorney's office for the district where it was signed. Maxwell identifies nothing in the 
 NPA's text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus concludes that the 
 NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
 B. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses 
 The NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the Si superseding 
 indictment even against an office bound to follow it. The NPA bars prosecution, following 
 Epstein's fulfillment of its conditions, only for three specific categories of offenses: 
 (1) "the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2" of the NPA; namely, "any offenses that 
 may have been committed by Epstein against the United States from in or around 
 2001 through in or around September 2007" including five enumerated offenses; 
 (2) "any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office"; and 
 (3) "any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation." 
 6 
 EFTA00020266
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 7 of 34 
 Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to 
 and deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2001 and 2007. 
 Maxwell contends that the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the 
 offenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase 
 "potential co-conspirator" means nothing without answering the question "co-conspirator in 
 what?" The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who 
 conspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those 
 offenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein 
 from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office 
 investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation. 
 The Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA. 
 Those charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from 
 depositions in 2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell now 
 concedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the Si superseding indictment in its 
 entirety, perjury counts and all. 
 The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA's scope. The Si 
 superseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994 and 1997, some 
 four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the 
 NPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes committed 
 before the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office investigation. 
 Maxwell's protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the 
 offenses charged in the SI superseding indictment.

 EFTA00020267
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8 of 34 
 C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
 In the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct 
 an evidentiary hearing as to the parties' intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so. 
 The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement 
 mostly involved oral agreements where there was no written record of the full set of terms 
 reached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of 
 negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. "An oral agreement greatly 
 increases the potential for disputes such as . .. a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the 
 terms, of the deal." United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, an 
 evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never committed to 
 writing. This is no such case. The NPA's terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive 
 OPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors 
 promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the 
 Government that Maxwell's request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture. 
 For the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it 
 appears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her 
 motion —the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government's 
 disclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or 
 evidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under 
 the NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any 
 evidence supporting Maxwell's interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose, 
 and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 9 of 34 
 II. The indictment is timely 
 A. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations 
 Federal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. 18 
 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children, 
 Congress has provided a longer limitations period for "offense[s] involving the sexual or 
 physical abuse, or kidnaping" of a minor. 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2003, the operative version 
 of § 3283 allowed prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five. 
 Congress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-
 21, 117 Stat. 650, to allow prosecution any time during the life of the victim. 
 The parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act, 
 but untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2003 
 version of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
 involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the 
 general statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2003 version of § 3283 
 applies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2003. The Court concludes that statute of 
 limitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely. 
 1. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors 
 Maxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the SI superseding indictment involve 
 the sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the 
 alleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for 
 that purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
 involving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each 
 statutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 221 (1953). In Maxwell's view, 
 9 
 EFTA00020269
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 10 of 34 
 for example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity 
 and not follow through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential 
 ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related 
 conspiracy charges. 
 This approach is analogous to the "categorical approach" employed by courts to evaluate 
 prior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495 
 U.S. 575, 602 (1990). Generally speaking, the "categorical approach" requires that courts "look 
 only to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements" of the relevant offense to determine if the 
 provision applies "and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions." Descamps v. 
 United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a statute 
 requires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To 
 determine whether Congress used the word "offense" in a statute to refer to an offense in the 
 abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute's "text, 
 context, and history." United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2327 (2019). 
 Though it has not authoritatively settled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly 
 suggested that Maxwell's approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 
 48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017), the Second Circuit discussed at length how the text, context, and 
 history of § 3283 show that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific 
 approach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 801 
 F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015). 
 The Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, "[t]he 
 Supreme Court's modem categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction 
 contexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases." Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.

 To the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is 
 inappropriate here. 
 The Court begins with the statute's text. Statutes that call for application of the 
 categorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction. 
 Id. at 59. "The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal 
 elements to the conduct involv[ed]' in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress 
 intended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied." Id. at 
 59-60 (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but 
 that case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States 
 v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a 
 statute which uses the language "an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to 
 the victim or victims exceeds $10,000" is "consistent with a circumstance-specific approach." 
 Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (emphasis added). Thus, the word "involves" 
 generally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as committed in each 
 case. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to 
 apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60; 
 Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196. 
 The purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes 
 dealing with prior convictions, "[t]he categorical approach serves `practical' purposes: It 
 promotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions 
 in minitrials conducted long after the fact." Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 200-01 (2013). 
 In the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the 
 first instance whether "the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct." Weingarten, 
 11 
 EFTA00020271
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 12 of 34 
 865 F.3d at 60. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283 
 would be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements 
 of the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some 
 additional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least, 
 when the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not 
 justify setting aside the statute's language and apparent purpose. 
 Maxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953), to urge this 
 Court to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended 
 the limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that 
 case, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing 
 was not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as 
 required by the statute. Id. at 221. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that 
 the offense did not require fraud as an "essential ingredient." Id. at 222. It reached that 
 conclusion in large part because the statute's legislative history made clear that Congress 
 intended it to apply only to a narrow class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. Id. at 216. 
 As the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the 
 enacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. 10. "In passing recent statutes 
 related to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress 
 `evinced a general intention to "'cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as 
 possible."' Id. at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 
 F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges' holding—
 legislative history supporting a narrow interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the 
 statute's plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 13 of 34 
 Based on the statute's text, context, and history, the Court follows Weingarten and 
 concludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse 
 of a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus 
 concludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here. 
 2. The 2003 amendment to the statute of l"tations applies to these offenses 
 Maxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the 
 PROTECT Act's enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to 
 her alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in 
 Weingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the 
 view Maxwell now takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions 
 of at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773 
 F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 
 2006). 
 The Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal 
 statute applies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994). 
 Courts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct, 
 courts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past 
 conduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Id. 
 The Court begins with Landgraf s first step. To assess a statute's meaning here, courts 
 must consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including 
 the statute's history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter. 
 Mortg. Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 406 (2d Cir. 2004).

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 14 of 34 
 Section 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that "[n]o statute of 
 limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
 physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution 
 during the life of the child." The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have 
 held that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief, 
 438 F.3d at 923. The statute's plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to 
 prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a 
 new limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that 
 would otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the 
 application of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct. 
 Courts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language. 
 The Eighth Circuit has held that the 1994 amendments to § 3283, which allowed prosecution of 
 sex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See 
 United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2005). The Second Circuit has observed 
 that the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-26, 105 Stat. 123, 
 illustrates language that requires a statute's application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg. 
 Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. That statute eliminated the statute of 
 limitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that "no limitation shall terminate the 
 period within which suit may be filed." Id. The PROTECT Act's language is quite similar. 
 The history of § 3283 confirms Congress's intent to apply the extended limitations period 
 as broadly as the Constitution allows. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress 
 further extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children "may be 
 difficult to detect quickly" because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse. 
 14 
 EFTA00020274
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 15 of 34 
 Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act 
 because it found the prior statute of limitations was "inadequate in many cases." H.R. Conf. 
 Rep. No. 108-63, at 54 (2003). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not 
 be prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as 
 the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25." Id. 
 Maxwell makes no argument based on the statute's text. Instead, she contends that 
 because the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its 
 final form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past 
 conduct. However, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity 
 provision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The 
 Supreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex 
 Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations 
 does not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632-33 (2003). Senator Leahy, who co-
 sponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a committee report that the proposed 
 retroactivity provision was "of doubtful constitutionality" because it "would have revived the 
 government's authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred." 149 Cong. Rec. 
 S5137, S5147 (Apr. 10, 2003) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision 
 shortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shows only 
 that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including 
 past conduct—like Maxwell's—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired. 
 Both the text and history of the PROTECT Act's amendment to § 3283 reflect that it 
 applies Maxwell's conduct charged in the SI superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.

 However, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to 
 these charges. 
 At Lanfgraf s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past 
 conduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. IA] statute has presumptively 
 impermissible retroactive effects when it 'takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under 
 existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in 
 respect to transactions or considerations already past.'" Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting 
 Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 290). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-
 barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. 
 Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet 
 expired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir. 1995). 
 Maxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when 
 Congress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights. 
 Maxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that 
 occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a 
 lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the 
 difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a 
 defendant's interest in repose. Maxwell's fairness argument is a gripe with Congress's policy 
 judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that 
 § 3283 allows her prosecution now. 
 B. The Government's delay in bringing charges did not violate due process 
 "As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is 'the 
 primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges."' United States v. Cornielle, 
 16 
 EFTA00020276
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 17 of 34 
 171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 
 322 (1971)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of 
 limitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pm-indictment delay violates due process, a 
 defendant must show both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an 
 improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant's ability defend against the 
 charges. See id. This is a stringent standard. "Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have 
 shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses 
 prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar." DeMichele v. 
 Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999). 
 The Court sees no evidence that the Government's delay in bringing these charges was 
 designed to thwart Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. However, it is enough to say that 
 Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. 
 Maxwell contends that the Government's delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests 
 because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or 
 destroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference 
 in her case. 
 Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include 
 Jeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged 
 victims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends 
 they all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have 
 generally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable 
 testimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388 
 F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell 
 17 
 EFTA00020277
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 18 of 34 
 provides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The 
 testimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach 
 investigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to 
 establish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the 
 relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he 
 had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v. 
 Spears, 159 F.3d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1999). 
 Maxwell's arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility 
 of missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are 
 difficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and 
 they do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325-26 
 (1971); see United States v. Elsbery, 602 F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1979). 
 Finally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has 
 garnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her 
 reputation from that of Epstein's friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without 
 evidence —that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will 
 not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell's bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a 
 perjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the 
 pretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury. 
 The Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the 
 Government's delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial 
 shows otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due 
 process bars the charges here.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 19 of 34 
 III. The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity 
 Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative 
 to compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. 
 The Court concludes that the charges in the S1 superseding indictment are clear enough. 
 Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain "a plain, 
 concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged." 
 The indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the 
 defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United 
 States v. Stavrouiakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). "Under this test, an indictment need do 
 little more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in 
 approximate terms) of the alleged crime." United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d 
 Cir. 1975). In addition to dismissal, "Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
 permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity 
 the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to 
 prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second 
 time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). 
 The S1 superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts 
 supporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague 
 because it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like "grooming" and 
 "befriending" that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name. 
 Maxwell's first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and 
 place of charged conduct "in approximate terms." Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The details are 
 subject to proof at trial. "[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the 'on or about' language used 
 19 
 EFTA00020279
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 20 of 34 
 to describe the window of when a violation occurred." United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 
 364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 
 1987)). "This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse 
 of underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses." United States v. 
 Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (collecting 
 cases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time, 
 and witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when 
 abuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct. 
 Maxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges 
 impermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the 
 indictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of 
 the crime. Tram ;;;; ti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The language of the Si superseding indictment does so. 
 The Government's decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper 
 Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell's argument that some of the conduct alleged is 
 not inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government's case, not the specificity of the 
 charges. 
 Finally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not 
 provide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged 
 victims' names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally 
 need not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United 
 States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 
 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Maxwell likely knows the identity of the alleged victims described in the 
 indictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive discovery on them. 
 20 
 EFTA00020280
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 21 of 34 
 Moreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus 
 no unfairness here. See Stringer, 730 F.3d at 126. As discussed below, the Court will require 
 the parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
 IV. The perjury charges are legally tenable 
 The Court turns next to Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from 
 her answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are 
 legally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions 
 were not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are 
 legally tenable and Maxwell's defenses are appropriately left to the jury. 
 The applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who "in any 
 proceeding before or ancillary to any court ... knowingly makes any false material declaration." 
 18 U.S.C. § 1623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knowingly false and is material to the 
 proceeding in which the defendant offered it. 
 A. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge 
 The requirement of knowing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is 
 false. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 1986). As a general matter, "[a] jury is 
 best equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question." Id. 
 Courts have acknowledged a narrow exception for questions that are so fundamentally 
 ambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also 
 United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. 1970). A question is fundamentally 
 ambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d 
 at 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a 
 witness who understood the question. 
 21 
 EFTA00020281
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 22 of 34 
 At a minimum, Maxwell's motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a 
 question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at 
 trial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The evidence at 
 trial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in 
 context or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely 
 considered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the 
 alleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The 
 context of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government's evidence, could lead 
 a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are 
 questions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury's 
 role on the limited pretrial record. 
 B. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell's statements were material 
 Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the 
 allegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a 
 statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer 
 might reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 515 
 U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, 753-54 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing 
 falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be "decided by the jury, 
 not the court." Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 465 (1997). Only the most extraordinary 
 circumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d 
 406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 522-23). 
 The charged statements do not fall within this narrow exception. Maxwell contends that 
 the questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the 
 22 
 EFTA00020282
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 23 of 34 
 civil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that 
 Maxwell's answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the 
 factfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509; Kross, 14 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a 
 reasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permitted the 
 plaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiff's 
 testimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial 
 resolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against "invading the 'inviolable function of the 
 jury' in our criminal justice system," and if the "defense raises a factual dispute that is 
 inextricably intertwined with a defendant's potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that 
 dispute on a Rule 12(b) motion." United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d Cir. 2018). 
 The Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately 
 presented to the jury. 
 V. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately 
 Although the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of 
 justice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts 
 together with the Mann Act counts would require admitting evidence of other acts likely to be 
 unduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell's chosen counsel based on their 
 involvement in the earlier civil case. 
 Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a court to order separate 
 trials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking 
 severance must show significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting 
 multiple trials. United States v. Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998). The harm to the 
 defendant must be more than "solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than 
 23 
 EFTA00020283
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 24 of 34 
 one." United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. 1980). Though this standard is 
 demanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell 
 meets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell's right to the counsel of 
 her choice and risk an unfair trial. 
 Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on 
 each set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would 
 potentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a 
 joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil 
 litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell's charged conduct. This presents a 
 significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find 
 guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 
 422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice 
 the jury's ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell's truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of 
 the perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to 
 mitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved. 
 Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of 
 Maxwell's attorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely 
 implicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom 
 represent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a 
 lawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a 
 witness. N.Y. R. Prof'/ Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell's counsel in the civil action and the 
 deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not 
 required to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her 
 24 
 EFTA00020284
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 25 of 34 
 counsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the 
 Mann Act charges. 
 The Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party's attorney 
 presents serious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 173, 
 178 (2d Cir. 2009). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their own credibility, jurors might 
 perceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between 
 argument and evidence might confuse the jury. Id. Disqualification of counsel also implicates 
 Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g., 
 United States v. Kincade, No. 15-cr-00071 (JAD) (GWF), 2016 WL 6154901, at *6 (D. Nev. 
 Oct. 21, 2016). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the attorneys who 
 represented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with 
 the facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 
 1064, 1070-71 (2d Cir. 1982). 
 The Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial 
 participants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does 
 not overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and 
 evidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, 14 F.3d at 
 753-54; Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to 
 both sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far 
 beyond the narrower issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at 
 least some of Maxwell's concerns are overstated, there is little question that the jury's 
 consideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time 
 and resources to provide the requisite context.

 The balance of these considerations favors severance. "Motions to sever are committed 
 to the sound discretion of the trial judge." United States v. Casarnento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d 
 Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will 
 best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case. 
 VI. Maxwell's motion to strike surplusage is premature 
 Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the SI 
 superseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture. 
 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a court to strike surplusage from an 
 indictment on a defendant's motion. "Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be 
 granted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are 
 inflammatory and prejudicial." United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996) 
 (cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the 
 presentation of the Government's evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect how 
 specific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. I 8-cr-224 
 (MN), 2019 WL 6702361, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2019); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. 
 Supp. 2d 451, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). 
 Maxwell contends that the allegations related to "Minor Victim-3" are surplusage 
 because the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or 
 was below the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she 
 argues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an attempt to 
 introduce Minor Victim-3's testimony for impermissible purposes. 
 The Court will not strike any language from the S 1 superseding indictment at this 
 juncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is "exacting" and requires the defendant to demonstrate 
 26 
 EFTA00020286
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 27 of 34 
 clearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552 
 F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim 
 traveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the 
 Court cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the 
 charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell's state of mind. See United 
 States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992). The Court will follow the well-worn 
 path of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion 
 then. 
 VII. Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature 
 Maxwell's motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the SI superseding 
 indictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has 
 alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. "An indictment is multiplicitous when it 
 charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, 
 only one crime has been committed." United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999). 
 "The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, 
 which assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple 
 punishments for the same offense." United States v. Nakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987) 
 (cleaned up). 
 "Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does 
 not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one 
 punishment is eventually imposed." United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 
 2006). "Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to 
 dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature." United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272 
 27 
 EFTA00020287
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 28 of 34 
 (PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014) (collecting cases). The Court therefore 
 denies Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice. 
 VIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures 
 Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it 
 has in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the 
 Government's witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator 
 statements, and Rule 404(b) material. Based on the Government's response in briefing and 
 letters the parties have since submitted to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have 
 been overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not 
 entitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will 
 require the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
 A. The Court accepts the Government's representations that it has disclosed all 
 Brady and Giglio Material 
 The Supreme Court's decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. 
 United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain 
 evidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under 
 Giglio, the Government has a duty to produce "not only exculpatory material, but also 
 information that could be used to impeach a key government witness." United States v. Coppa, 
 267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154). As a general rule, "Brady and 
 its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material 
 upon request by a defendant." Id. at 146. "[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in 
 time for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law 
 simply because it did not produce the evidence sooner." Id. at 144. 
 28 
 EFTA00020288
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 29 of 34 
 Maxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio 
 material and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to 
 disclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (1) 
 records of witness interviews in connection with an ex pane declaration in support of a response 
 to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a 
 personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the 
 Government has issued for Maxwell's records as part of its investigation in this case. 
 The Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has 
 reviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents 
 includes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the 
 Government's representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has 
 complied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are 
 covered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the 
 terms of the statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. Next, the Government 
 represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and 
 so that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third 
 party, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them. 
 See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Finally, Maxwell's 
 request for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal 
 basis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents. 
 The Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and 
 Giglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady 
 and that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no 
 29 
 EFTA00020289
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 30 of 34 
 reason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus 
 far in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent letter to produce Giglio material six 
 weeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a 
 schedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively 
 prepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at 144. 
 B. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements 
 Maxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory 
 statements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3500, "provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of 
 discovery until that witness has testified on direct examination." Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. The 
 statute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of 
 witness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. "A coconspirator who testifies on 
 behalf of the government is a witness under the Act." In re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d 
 Cir. 1987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent power to expedite these disclosures. In any 
 case, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance 
 of trial. 
 The Court also rejects Maxwell's alternative request for a hearing to determine the 
 admissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admitted at 
 trial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden 
 to show that the conditionally admitted statements were made in furtherance of the charged 
 conspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a 
 mistrial. United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993). Although conditional 
 admissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government 
 30 
 EFTA00020290
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 31 of 34 
 has committed to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to 
 allow Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any 
 proffered co-conspirator testimony following the Government's Jencks Act disclosures. 
 C. Witness list 
 As a general matter, "district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the 
 identity of government witnesses." United States v. Cannon, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1975). 
 In deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a 
 defendant has made a specific showing that disclosure is "both material to the preparation of the 
 defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case." United States v. 
 Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139-140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up). 
 Maxwell has made a particularized showing that the Government must produce a witness 
 list reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old 
 allegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of 
 the defense. However, the Government's proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford 
 Maxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allows Maxwell 
 significantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this 
 District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 
 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 
 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April 13, 2021, the 
 Government produced over 20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related 
 to non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the 
 issues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of 
 discovery, the Court concludes that the Government's proposal is generally reasonable. 
 31 
 EFTA00020291
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 32 of 34 
 D. Rule 404(b) material 
 Maxwell's final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government 
 seeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(6). Under Rule 4O4(b), if the prosecutor in a 
 criminal case intends to use "evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act" against a defendant, the 
 prosecutor must "provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the 
 prosecutor intends to offer at trial" and must "do so in writing before trial—or in any form 
 during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice." The Government 
 represents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in 
 advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final 
 pretrial conference. The Government's proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge 
 admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court's attention any issues that require resolution 
 before trial. "This is all that Rule 404(b) requires." United States v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378 
 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013). The Court concludes this schedule is 
 generally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of 
 trial is strongly encouraged. 
 The Court's denial of Maxwell's requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude 
 the parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account 
 for Maxwell's specific concerns. "[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to 
 the benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court." United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 
 (2d Cir. 1974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus 
 schedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above 
 materials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient. 
 32 
 EFTA00020292
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 33 of 34 
 Given the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the 
 Court encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks. 
 IX. The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell's grand jury challenge 
 The Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of 
 the S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.' However, Maxwell's 
 motion seeking to dismiss the Si superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury 
 sitting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury 
 drawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the 
 community, because her trial would proceed in the Manhattan Division. A grand jury sitting in 
 Manhattan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 21, 2021, Maxwell shall show 
 cause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis. 
 Conclusion 
 The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's 
 non -prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the 
 statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No. 
 137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the 
 perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to 
 dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial 
 disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts 
 for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). 
 ' The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any available additional or supplement rulings in 
 light of the filing of the S2 indictment. 
 33 
 EFTA00020293
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 34 of 34 
 The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers 
 any evidence related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 
 16 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. 
 The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial 
 disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including 
 co-conspirator statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the 
 identity of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. 
 The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental 
 motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be 
 submitted by April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their 
 respective proposals. 
 The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why her motion to 
 dismiss the SI superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be 
 denied as moot.

 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 
 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As detailed in the subpoena and Maxwell's 
 moving papers, she seeks authorization to serve a subpoena to the law firm of Boies, Schiller and 
 Flexner LLP. BSF has filed a letter in opposition to the subpoena request. Additionally, the 
 Government submitted a letter requesting that it be given notice of all pending and future 
 subpoenas applications, an opportunity to challenge them, and copies of any documents 
 produced. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's motion as to Requests 1 
 through 8 and Request 12 and reserves judgment on Requests 9 through 11. The Court also 
 denies the Government's requests, though it will direct the Government to notify the Court of its 
 views as to Requests 9 through 11. 
 I. Legal Standard 
 Rule 17(c) permits subpoenas ordering the production of "books, papers, documents, 
 data, or other objects." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). When the subpoena seeks the production of 
 personal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by 
 court order. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).

 The purpose of Rule 17(c) is to facilitate the trial by designating a time and place prior to 
 trial to obtain and inspect evidentiary material. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-99 
 (1974) (citing Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951)). It is not intended 
 to provide an additional means of discovery or to serve as a general "fishing expedition." Id. at 
 698-700. As a result, courts must be mindful not to allow the Rule 17(c) process to become a 
 "broad discovery device" that would undermine the discovery procedures set forth in Rule 16. 
 United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Thus, if an item is not 
 discoverable under Rule 16, a party cannot make it discoverable simply by subpoenaing it under 
 Rule 17. United States v. Barnes, No. S9 04-CR-186 (SCR), 2008 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
 Apr. 2, 2008). 
 To determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the 
 factors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 699-700. In Nixon, the Supreme Court 
 explained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must show: (1) that 
 the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably 
 in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for 
 trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such 
 inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good 
 faith and is not intended as a general `fishing expedition."' Id. at 698-700. To clear that hurdle, 
 the Court considers (1) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. Id. at 700. 
 II. Discussion 
 A. The BSF Subpoena 
 The proposed subpoena makes twelve requests. Some of the requests relate to documents 
 that Maxwell believes will be relevant at trial. For others, the proffered relevance relates to 
 2 
 EFTA00020299
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 3 of 9 
 Maxwell's pending motions to suppress evidence. While ordinarily Rule 17(c) is "trial-focused" 
 and "may be used only to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial," at least some courts 
 have held that Rule 17(c) can be used to compel the production of documents in connection with 
 a suppression hearing. United States v. Louis, No. 04-CR-203 (LTS), 2005 WL 180885, at *3 
 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2005). Even then, the requests fail for the reasons stated below. 
 Requests 1 through 5 all fail on the basis that they do not comply with Nixon's specificity 
 requirement. Requests 1 through 5 all target communications between "any" owner, 
 shareholder, partner or employee of BSF and government officials or co-counsel in civil 
 litigation, from 2015 to the date of the subpoena. While the requests focus on a certain subject, 
 the requests are so overbroad that issuance of the Rule 17(c) subpoena would be improper. As 
 set forth in the subpoena, the term "communications" encompasses "all forms of correspondence, 
 including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other written communication of 
 information of any kind." The use of the terms "all" and "any" "do not evince specificity." 
 United States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19-CR-472 (PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 
 2021). Here, the requests do not identify specific lawyers or employees of BSF whose 
 communications are relevant. See United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2017) (discussing that while an originally requested subpoena was insufficiently specific, a new 
 requested subpoena satisfied the specificity requirement because it identified a specified set of 
 individuals whose records were sought). The requests also encompass "all" forms of 
 correspondence without limitation. And while the requested subpoenas are limited to the period 
 between 2015 and 2021, the timeframe is still overly broad. These requests are precisely the 
 kind of "fishing expedition" that the specificity requirement is designed to prevent. See Bowman 
 Dairy Co., 341 U.S. at 221. Indeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation. 
 3 
 EFTA00020300
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 4 of 9 
 See United States v. Avenatti, No. (SI) I9-CR-373 (PGG), 2020 WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
 Jan. 6, 2020). But Rule 17(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 698; 
 Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253. On the specificity prong alone, Requests 1 through 5 fail to satisfy 
 the Nixon standard. 
 Requests 1 and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials 
 sought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests 1, 2, and 8 all seek documents 
 that are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests 1 and 2 seek 
 communications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2015 
 to the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that 
 the Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule 17(c) 
 subpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government's failure to comply with its 
 discovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be 
 otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 418 
 U.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the 
 hands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government 
 has not met its discovery obligations, the Rule 17(c) subpoena process is not the proper 
 mechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly 
 joined, Maxwell must make some showing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief 
 from this Court. 
 Requests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement letters between BSF 
 and two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required showing 
 under Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule 17(c) 
 application. The only plausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell's papers is that these 
 4 
 EFTA00020301
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 5 of 9 
 documents are necessary for purposes of impeachment. But as a general matter, the need to 
 impeach witnesses generally "is insufficient to require [materials'] production in advance of 
 trial." Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701. Many courts have held that impeachment material does not 
 become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No. 15-CR-317 
 (ICMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), ), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 
 2021) (collecting cases); United States v. Scaduto, No. 94-CR-311 (WK), 1995 WL 130511, at 
 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 1995) ("Potentially impeaching statements `ripen into evidentiary 
 material. . . only if and when the witness testifies at trial...." (citation omitted)). See also 
 Avenatti, 2020 WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings 
 in question prior to trial in order "to demonstrate witnesses' bias or self-interest."). The 
 arguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance 
 the materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is little risk that 
 review of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, 
 given their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. I6-CR-467, 2017 WL 4838311, at *2 
 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2017). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF 
 clients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require 
 production of the engagement letters to the Court so that the information can be made available 
 to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness's direct testimony. See United 
 States v. Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at *3 *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992); 
 United States v. Ferguson, No. 3:06-CR-137 (CFD), 2007 WL 4577303, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. 
 26, 2007). 
 Maxwell also argues that compulsion of the materials' production under Rule 17(c) is 
 justified because the materials appear not to have been produced by BSF in response to the grand 
 5 
 EFTA00020302
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 6 of 9 
 jury subpoena at issue in Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that 
 production suggests coordination between the Government and BSF. Other than through 
 conclusory speculation, she fails to explain how the contents of those letters may be relevant to 
 her theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the 
 extent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce 
 them in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is little more than an attempt to 
 circumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not 
 yet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents 
 consistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion & 
 Order resolving some of Maxwell's pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good 
 faith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to 
 comply with them. This Court knows well that the Government has not always lived up to those 
 obligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good 
 faith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum, 
 none of Maxwell's theories justify production of these documents under the Rule 17(c) process. 
 Request 12, which seeks "any" submission to the Epstein Victims' Compensation 
 Program made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks 
 "any" submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell 
 offered to narrow this request to just those materials submitted on behalf of victims who 
 ultimately testify in this action. 
 The request's failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of 
 specificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this 
 request, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submitted to the EVCP. 
 6 
 EFTA00020303
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 7 of 9 
 See United States v. Aguilar, No. CR 07-00030 (SBA), 2008 WL 3182029, at *6 (ND. Cal. Aug. 
 4, 2008). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary 
 incentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are 
 being sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be 
 impeachment evidence does not render them "relevant" for purposes of Rule 17(c); if at all, those 
 documents would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2018 WL 2254538, 
 at *2. Maxwell's argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is 
 exculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or 
 when those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are 
 exculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for 
 purposes of cross-examination, leaving little doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And 
 to the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be 
 exculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why 
 that expectation might be reasonable. The "mere hope" that the documents may contain some 
 exculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule 17(c) subpoena (or, as here, 
 issuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-
 579 (SWK), 1984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 1984). Maxwell's reliance on cases 
 involving the Government's obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment 
 evidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2016 WL 8735699, at *2-
 3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request 12's compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell 
 may renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose 
 submissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At 
 that time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require production of these materials to 
 7 
 EFTA00020304
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 8 of 9 
 the Court so that the information may be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the 
 conclusion of each witness's direct testimony. See Giampa, 1992 WL 296440, at *3; Ferguson, 
 2007 WL 4577303, at *3. 
 The Court will reserve on Requests 9 through II in order to allow the Government to 
 weigh in on the propriety of the requests. The Court assumes that the Government has enough 
 information, based on the public filings, to provide its views. If the Government seeks the 
 specific subpoena requests, it shall confer with defense counsel and raise any dispute with the 
 Court. The Government shall file its response within one week of this Order. 
 In sum, for Request 1 through 8 and 12, the Court will not authorize service of the 
 proposed subpoena on the basis that Maxwell has failed to establish that the requests are 
 sufficiently specific and that the materials sought are relevant or admissible. Maxwell may 
 renew more tailored requests in compliance with this Order. The Court sees no basis for doing 
 so on an ex parte basis. For Requests 9 through 11, the Court will reserve its decision until it 
 hears from the Government. 
 B. The Government's Subpoena-Related Request 
 The Government seeks a preemptive, blanket ruling that it be entitled notice of all future 
 subpoenas, an opportunity to challenge them, and production of any information obtained 
 therefrom. This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena 
 for which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the 
 Court would likely consider the Government's briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty 
 to ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon. See United States v. Bergstein, No. 
 I6-CR-746 (PKC), 2017 WL 6887596, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2017). But ex parte Rule 17(c) 
 subpoenas are possible in some circumstances if justified. See Sicelos, 2018 WL 2254538, at *8

 DATE FILED: 5/3/21

 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 Last summer, the Court scheduled trial in this matter to commence on July 12, 2021. On 
 March 29, 2021, three and a half months before trial, the Government filed an S2 Superseding 
 Indictment. As a result of the late filing of the S2, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell 
 request a continuance of the trial date until either fall 2021 or January 2022. t The Government 
 opposes any continuance, but requests that if one is granted it be until March of 2022. Having 
 carefully considered the parties' respective positions, the Court GRANTS Maxwell's request for 
 a short continuance until the fall of 2021 to allow the defense to prepare for the additional 
 charges brought in the S2 indictment. The Court rejects Maxwell's alternative request to 
 continue the trial date until January of 2022 and the Government's alternative proposal that the 
 Court adjourn trial until March of 2022. 
 The Court bases its decision on a number of factors. First, the filing of the S2 indictment 
 has added a significant burden to the defense's preparation for trial. The new indictment alleges 
 The alternative request by Maxwell resulted from a conflict among lawyers involved in both this case and a 
 criminal matter before Judge Furman, which is discussed in defense counsel's letter. Dkt. No. 246 at 4. The Court 
 has been informed that Judge Furman has adjourned the trial date with respect to two defendants. The Court 
 presumes that this eliminates the September through December conflict for one of Maxwell's defense counsel. It 
 presumably does not eliminate the conflict for one of the AUSAs involved in both cases. Dkt. No. 235 at 10 n.5. 
 EFTA00020307
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 266 Filed 05/03/21 Page 2 of 3 
 that the conspiracies charged in Counts I and 3 extended to 2004 (the S I charged through 1997), 
 identifying a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two new charges: Count 5 of 
 the S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy between 
 2001 and 2004, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating in the sex trafficking of a minor 
 or aiding and abetting the same. Dkt. No. 187. These additions will require the defense to (1) 
 review a substantial amount of discovery that is now potentially relevant as a result of the S2 
 Indictment; (2) re-review discovery that it had previously considered in light of the changes to 
 the case against her; (3) conduct new investigations based on the new charges, including 
 potential interviews of new witnesses; and (4) re-evaluate her trial preparation and strategy. 
 Second, although jury trials have resumed in the district and conditions in MDC and around the 
 country are improving, the defendant's and defense counsel's preparation efforts to date have 
 been and to some extent continue to be hampered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As 
 the Government indicated in explaining the delay in filing the new charges, travel constraints and 
 other safety concerns resulting from the pandemic have slowed trial preparation and complicated 
 the logistics of conducting investigations. See Dkt. No. 199 at 2. Third, defense counsel must 
 balance preparing for trial with considering and preparing any supplemental pre-trial motions in 
 response to the new charges contained in the S2 Indictment. Although the perjury counts were 
 recently severed, the Court cannot conclude that this sufficiently offsets the additional burdens 
 placed on the defense as a result of the new charges and expanded timeframe resulting from the 
 S2 indictment. 
 The Court is very mindful of the countervailing considerations that require that any 
 adjournment be no longer than necessary. For one, the Defendant, whose counsel strenuously 
 request the adjournment, is detained pre-trial. Moreover, with many lawyers on both sides of 
 EFTA00020308
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 266 Filed 05/03/21 Page 3 of 3 
 this case, any adjournment runs the risk of precluding some attorneys from being able to 
 participate and/or requiring them to seek adjustments to schedules in other matters. And, 
 importantly, any victims and the public more broadly have a strong interest in trial proceeding 
 without undue delay. It is the Court's obligation to ensure that the case proceed to that trial as 
 expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and all relevant 
 circumstances. See 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(7)(A); 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7). 
 Having balanced all of the factors outlined above, the Court concludes that the interests 
 of justice justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 
 to be reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to 
 prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also 
 ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary or in the 
 interests of justice. 
 The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 2021, they shall 
 jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office (as is required by 
 COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest possible date this fall and to 
 seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an early fall trial start date. The parties 
 shall also discuss and propose any adjustments necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. 
 No. 250. The Government may move in the letter for any requested exclusion of time under the 
 Speedy Trial Act. 
 SO ORDERED.

 Date: Thu, 01 Apr 2021 14:53:20 +0000 
 Our client has requested that we cancel tomorrow's meeting. She has now had to recount her interactions with 
 Epstein one too many times, and since it's her understanding that it's unlikely that any of her information would 
 in fact materially advance your current prosecutions, she'd prefer to forego another interview. 
 Hope that's ok on your end, and of course let us know if you have any questions at all.

 Inline-Images: image00 Ljpg 
 All, 
 We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
 case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
 First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
 which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
 physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
 Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
 own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
 which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
 In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
 Physical Evidence 
 • All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
 and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
 accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
 o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
 pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
 photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
 o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
 with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
 o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
 and where they are. 
 • We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
 from Judge Nathan to do so. 
 • Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
 bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
 of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
 March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
 • The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
 confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
 we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
 we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
 review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
 basis. 
 • The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
 view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
 EFTA00020322
leave of the Court in advance. 
 • We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
 Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
 separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
 government. 
 • Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
 below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
 discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
 • Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
 understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
 for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
 located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
 • During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
 defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
 confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
 previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
 Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
 Thank you.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 All, 
 Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
 discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
 In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
 Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
 • There are three categories of these images: 
 o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
 been previously provided to you) 
 o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
 previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
 o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
 Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
 • The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
 and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
 EFTA00020323
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
 be viewed using Cellebrite. 
 o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
 devices. 
 o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
 image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
 other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
 o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
 to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
 • Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
 there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
 to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
 Regarding the physical evidence: 
 • Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
 associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
 FBI New York office's current investigation. 
 • The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
 items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
 Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
 you will have all evidence in one place. 
 • The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
 following conditions: 
 o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
 place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
 o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
 o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
 o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
 To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
 to be physically present for this review. 
 o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
 may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
 the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
 are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
 presence of nudity. 
 o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
 • To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
 the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
 items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
 Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
 necessary. 
 • The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
 single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
 that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
 anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
 downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
 o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
 residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
 your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
 all of those discs. 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
 Thanks,

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
 Thank you,

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

 As discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in 
 CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for 
 Maxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. However, 
 if you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date range you 
 looking for. 
 Since as two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were 
 provided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel 
 crossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in chronological 
 order for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review her travel rather 
 than going back and forth between the two PDFs. 
 If you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't hesitate 
 to reach out!

 I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell 
 released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her 
 greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested 
 because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate 
 safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is 
 getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)

 could you please take on this project of making sure the victim info in the database is accurate for the letter that will 
 go out? I can't tell if this email is just meant to supplement the data we already have, or if they're sending this as the 
 proposed list (which would be strange, since it has our statutory victims on it). Thanks.

 Good Morning, 
 I hope each of you had a good weekend. Please find language below that has been approved by FBI NY, VSD 
 executive management and our OGC rep. I'm more than happy to have a call if you would like to discuss. 
 The FBI's Victim Services Division (VSD) is committed to providing services and support to victims of crimes 
 committed by Jeffrey Epstein. Though this particular indictment is focused on specific individuals, you are still 
 entitled to your rights, resources, and referrals as a federal victim independent of this indictment. An overview 
 of these services is available at www.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services. If you would like to speak with a Victim 
 Specialist, or if you have any questions regarding your rights to victim services and referrals, please email 
 victimservices@fbi.gov.

 With apologies for the quick turn around on this, could you please send us a list of all known bank accounts held in 
 Maxwell's name (or otherwise associated with her)? For those accounts, please provide the last year/month we have

 On June 30, 2021, the Government filed a letter directed at me, and this Court ordered that I respond by

 Thanks so much,. I was actually able to scan my version of signature the other day. Attached is a subpoena 
 from another case with that signature included. Would you please insert it into all of these subpoenas for the Korea case? 
 Couple other corrections: 
 • All of the riders appear to have a typo in the sentence beginning "A list of accounts hold, controlled, or accessible 
 to the following individual(s) and/or entity(ies)," which should instead read "A list of accounts held controlled, or 
 accessible to". Would you please fix that before sending out? 
 • There are a couple instances in which the word "Alaska" is misspelled (it's written "Alaksa" in the riders). Would 
 you please correct those? 
 • Some of the riders have highlighting in them—would you please remove that? 
 With those changes, these are good to go out.

 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 In re: Second Warrant and Order For 
 Prospective and Historical Location 
 Information and Pen Register 
 Information for the Cell hone Assigned 
 Call Number , USAO 
 Reference No. 2018R01618 
 AMENDED APPLICATION 
 20 mag. 6828
 Amended Application for Second Warrant and Order 
 for Cellphone Location and Pen Register Information 
 The United States of America, by its attorney, Audrey Strauss, Acting United States 
 Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Assistant United States 
 Attorney, of counsel, respectfully requests that the Court issue the accompanying proposed Second 
 Warrant and Order for prospective and historical location information and pen register information 
 for a cellphone. As grounds for this Amended Application the Government relies on the following 
 facts and authorities. 
 I. Introduction 
 . I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
 District of New York. This Amended Application is submitted in conjunction with the 
 accompanying amended affidavit of a law enforcement agent ("Amended Agent Affidavit"), to be 
 sworn before this Court, and incorporated by reference herein. I make this Amended Application 
 based on information and belief, including the Amended Agent Affidavit, my review of other 
 documents in the case, and information received from investigative personnel. 
 2. The Investigating Agency, Target Cellphone, Subscriber, Target Subject, Service 
 Provider, Subject Offenses, Successor Service Provider, and Successor Cellphone referenced in 
 this Amended Application are as specified in the Amended Agent Affidavit. 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020372
II. Legal Authority 
 A. Prospective Location Information 
 3. The Government seeks to obtain both precision location information and cell site data 
 for the Target Cellphone on a prospective basis (the "Prospective Location Information") for a 
 period of 45 days from the date of this order — the same period of time for which a warrant for a 
 tracking device may be granted under Rule 41(e)(2)(C). It bears noting, however, that while the 
 Prospective Location Information may permit "tracking" the user of the phone in the colloquial 
 sense, this is not an application for a warrant for a "tracking device" as defined in Fed. R. Crim. 
 P. 41(a)(2)(E) and 18 U.S.C. § 3117(b). Those provisions only apply where an agent is seeking to 
 physically install a tracking device on a given object. Instead, the Prospective Location 
 Information will be obtained by requiring the Service Provider to provide the information. 
 4. The authority for this application is found in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1), which authorizes 
 a court of competent jurisdiction to require any electronic communication service provider (which 
 includes a cellular telephone service provider') to disclose any "record or other information 
 pertaining to a subscriber" other than the "contents of communications," when the government 
 obtains, inter cilia, a warrant under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. § 
 2703(cX1)(A). Because data concerning a subscriber's location, such as precision location 
 information and cell site data, constitutes "information pertaining to a subscribe?' that does not 
 include the "contents of communications," that data is among the types of information available 
 See 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) (incorporating by cross-reference statutory definitions set forth in 18 
 U.S.C. § 2510); 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15) (defining "electronic communication service" as "any 
 service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic 
 communications"). 
 2 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020373
under § 2703(c)(1)(A).2 Further, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2711(3), this Court is a court of 
 competent jurisdiction under the Stored Communications Act because it has jurisdiction over the 
 Subject Offenses. 
 5. The Government's request for cell site data also implicates the pen register statute, 
 because such data constitutes signaling information used by the Service Provider to mute 
 communications to and from the Target Cellphone. In order to collect such data, a valid pen 
 register order is required.3 Accordingly, I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that such 
 signaling information is relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating 
 Agency into suspected violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
 B. Historical Location Information 
 6. The Government also seeks historical cell site data for the Target Cellphone for the 
 period from June I, 2020 to the present (the "Historical Location Information"). Because such 
 data —like "Prospective Location Information"—constitutes information concerning a subscriber, 
 the Court is authorized to order the Service Provider to provide this data pursuant to a warrant 
 2 See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d 448, 459-60 & n. 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Kaplan, J.) 
 (cellphone location information falls within § 2703(c)(1)); accord, e.g., United States v. Caraballo, 
 963 F. Supp. 2d 341, 361 (D.Vt. 2013); In re Order, 632 F. Supp. 2d 202, 207 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); 
 In re Application, 405 F. Supp. 2d 435, 444-45 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). But see In re Application, 849 
 F. Supp. 2d 526, 574 (D.Md. 2011) (rejecting view that cellular location data falls within the scope 
 of the SCA and finding that phone must be treated as "tracking device" for purposes of Rule 41 
 where used to collect location data); In re Application, 2009 WL 159187, at *5 *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
 Jan.13, 2009) (McMahon, J.) (same). 
 3 See 18 U.S.C. § 3121 (prohibiting use of pen register or trap and trace device without an order 
 under the pen register statute); 3127(3) & (4) (defining pen register and trap and trace device to 
 include devices or processes that record, inter alio, signaling information). Although cell site data 
 constitutes "signaling" information within the meaning of the pen register statute, a separate statute 
 precludes the Government from relying "solely" on the authority provided by the pen register 
 statute to ascertain a subscriber's location. 47 U.S.C. § 1002(a). Here, the Government seeks to 
 obtain such data pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c) as well as the pen register statute, rather than 
 "solely" under the latter statute. See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 456-59. 
 3 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020374
application under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c), under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. 
 § 2703(c)(1)(A). I respectfully submit that the same probable cause supporting the Government's 
 request for a warrant to obtain the Prospective Location Information requested above also supports 
 the issuance of a warrant under § 2703(c) for the requested Historical Location Information. In 
 addition, the Government seeks toll records for the same period as the Historical Location 
 Information. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), I respectfully submit that the Amended Agent 
 Affidavit offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe 
 that the toll record information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
 C. Pen Register Information 
 7. Finally, the Government seeks an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-26 authorizing 
 the use of a pen register on the Target Cellphone for a period of 45 days from the date of this order. 
 Specifically, the Government seeks an order directing the Service Provider to furnish any 
 information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to operate, unobtrusively and with 
 minimum disruption of service, a pen register and trap and trace device to capture all dialing, 
 routing, addressing, or signaling information associated with each call transmitted to or from the 
 Target Cellphone, as specified further in the proposed Second Warrant and Order (the "Pen 
 Register Information").4
 4 The Government is also not seeking authorization to obtain post-cut-through dialed digits 
 ("PCTDD"), or digits that are dialed after a telephone call from the Target Cellphone has been 
 connected. Pursuant to the attached Order, if possible, the Service Provider will forward only pre-
 cut -through -dialed digits to the Investigating Agency. However, if the Service Provider's 
 technical capabilities require it to forward all dialed digits, including PCTDD, to the Investigating 
 Agency, the Investigating Agency will only decode and forward to the agents assigned to the 
 investigation the numbers that are dialed before the call is cut through.

 EFTA00018027
8. I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that the Pen Register Information is 
 relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating Agency into suspected 
 violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
 D. Sealing and Non-Disclosure Order to Service Provider 
 9. When the Government obtains records or information under § 2703(c), it is not required 
 to notify the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(3). Additionally, the Government may 
 obtain an order precluding the Service Provider from notifying the subscriber or any other third-
 party of the warrant or order obtained, for such period as the Court deems appropriate, where there 
 is reason to believe that such notification will result in endangering the life or physical safety of 
 an individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, or intimidation 
 of potential witnesses, or will otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. 18 U.S.C. 
 § 2705(b). 
 10. Further, 18 U.S.C. § 3I23(d) provides that an order directing installation of a pen 
 register or trap and trace device shall direct the pertinent service provider "not to disclose the 
 existence of the pen register or trap and trace device or the existence of the investigation to the 
 listed subscriber, or to any other person unless or until otherwise ordered by the Court." 
 II. Accordingly, as explained further in the Amended Agent Affidavit, in light of the 
 confidential nature of the continuing criminal investigation and the adverse consequences expected 
 in the event of premature notification, the Government respectfully requests that the Court direct 
 the Service Provider not to notify the Subscriber or any other person of the Second Warrant and 
 Order sought herein for a period of one year, subject to extension upon application to the Court, if 
 necessary. 
 12. For similar reasons, I respectfully request that the proposed Second Warrant and Order, 
 this Amended Application, and the accompanying Amended Agent Affidavit, be maintained under 
 5 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020376
seal until the Court orders otherwise, except that the Government be permitted without further 
 order of this Court to serve this Second Warrant and Order on the Service Provider; provide copies 
 of the Second Warrant and Order or the supporting Amended Application and Amended Agent 
 Affidavit as need be to personnel assisting the Government in the investigation and prosecution of 
 this matter; and disclose these materials as necessary to comply with discovery and disclosure 
 obligations in any prosecutions related to this matter. 
 III. Prior Requests 
 13. As set forth in the Amended Agent Affidavit, the Government previously requested 
 Cellphone Location and Pen Register information for the Target Cellphone in an Application and 
 Agent Affidavit submitted on or about June 29, 2020.5 Also on or about June 29, 2020, United 
 States Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker granted the application and signed a Warrant and 
 Order for the requested information. On June 30, 2020, the Government learned that the Agent 
 Affidavit contained two inadvertent errors. Accordingly, the Government is submitting this 
 Amended Application and Amended Agent Affidavit to correct those errors and to seek a Second 
 Warrant and Order. 
 5 The original application also sought authorization for Cellphone Location and Pen Register 
 information for a second Target Cellphone, , which was identified as Target 
 Cellphone-1 in that application and which was also granted on or about June 29, 2020. Because 
 there were no errors in the application with respect to Target Cellphone-1, the Government does 
 seek a Second Warrant and Order with respect to that phone.

 classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my 
 responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, 
 enticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the 
 execution of search warrants involving electronic evidence. 
 2. Requested Information. I respectfully submit this Affidavit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
 §§ 2703(c) and (c)(1)(A) and the applicable procedures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41; 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020379
18 U.S.C. §§ 2703(d) & 2705; and 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3126, in support of a second warrant and 
 order for prospective location information, historical location information, toll records, and pen 
 register information, for the Target Cellphone identified below (collectively, the "Requested 
 Information"). 
 3. Basis for Knowledge. This Affidavit is based upon my participation in the 
 investigation, my examination of reports and records, and my conversations with other law 
 enforcement agents and other individuals, as well as my training and experience. Because this 
 Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of obtaining the Requested Information, it 
 does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of this investigation. Where the 
 contents of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, 
 they are reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated. In addition, unless 
 otherwise indicated, statements by others referenced in this Affidavit were not necessarily made 
 to me, but may have been provided to me by someone else to whom I have spoken or whose report 
 I have read (and who in turn may have had either direct or indirect knowledge of the statement). 
 Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Affidavit resulting from surveillance 
 does not necessarily set forth my personal observations, but may have been provided to me by 
 other law enforcement agents who observed the events, and to whom I have spoken or whose 
 report I have read. 
 4. Target Cellphone, Subscriber, Target Subject, and Service Provider. The Target 
 Cellphone referenced in this Affidavit is the cellphone assigned call number (the 
 "Target Cellphone"). As further discussed below, the Target Cellphone is subscribed to in the 
 name of "G Max" (the "Subscriber"). GHISLAINE MAXWELL is believed to use the Target 
 2 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020380
Cellphone and is a Target Subject of this investigation. AT&T is the Service Provider for the 
 Target Cellphone. 
 5. Precision Location Capability. Cellphone service providers have technical 
 capabilities that allow them to collect at least two kinds of information about the locations of the 
 cellphones to which they provide service: (a) precision location information, also known as E-911 
 Phase II data, GPS data, or latitude-longitude data, and (b) cell site data, also known as 
 "tower/face" or "tower/sector" information. Precision location information provides relatively 
 precise location information about a cellphone, which a provider can typically collect either via 
 GPS tracking technology built into the phone or by triangulating the device's signal as received 
 by the provider's nearby cell towers. Cell site data, by contrast, reflects only the cell tower and 
 sector thereof utilized in routing any communication to and from the cellphone, as well as the 
 approximate range of the cellphone from the tower during the communication (sometimes referred 
 to as "per-call measurement" ("PCM") or "round-trip time" ("RTT") data). Because cell towers 
 are often a half-mile or more apart, even in urban areas, and can be ten or more miles apart in rural 
 areas, cell site data is typically less precise than precision location information. Based on my 
 training and experience, I know that the Service Provider has the technical ability to collect 
 precision location information from any cellphone on its network, including by initiating a signal 
 on the Service Provider's network to determine the phone's location. I further know that cell site 
 data is routinely collected by the Service Provider in the course of routing calls placed to or from 
 any cellphone on their network.' 
 ' Toll records are sometimes necessary or helpful in order to obtain or interpret historical cell site 
 data and are therefore also requested herein. 
 3 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020381
6. Successor Service Provider. Because it is possible that the Target Subject may change 
 cellphone service provider during the course of this investigation, it is requested that the warrant 
 and investigative order requested apply without need for further order to any Successor Service 
 Provider who may provide service to the Target Cellphone during the time frames at issue herein. 
 II. Corrected Facts Establishing Probable Cause 
 7. Although I understand that probable cause is not necessary to obtain all of the 
 Requested Information, I respectfully submit that probable cause exists to believe that the 
 Requested Information will lead to the location of a person, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, to be 
 arrested for the crimes of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
 violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
 violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal 
 sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting a minor with intent to engage in 
 criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
 § 1623 (the "Subject Offenses"). 
 8. On June 29, 2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an 
 indictment charging GHISLAINE MAXWELL with the Subject Offenses. The Indictment 
 charging MAXWELL is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Indictment"). That same day, United 
 States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith signed a warrant for MAXWELL's arrest, which is 
 attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Arrest Warrant"). 
 9. In light of these pending charges in the Indictment and the issuance of the Arrest 
 Warrant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL is subject to arrest for the Subject Offenses. 
 10. Also on or about June 29, 2020, the Government submitted an Application and 
 accompanying Agent Affidavit seeking a Warrant and Order permitting the FBI to obtain, among 
 4 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020382
other things, Cellphone Location Information and Pen Register Information for the Target 
 Cellphone.' Those documents were filed under the docket number 20 Mag. 6770. The original 
 Application and Agent Affidavit are attached as Exhibit C hereto. That same day, United States 
 Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker signed the requested Warrant and Order for the Target 
 Cellphone, also filed under docket number 20 Mag. 6770. The original Warrant and Order for the 
 Target Cellphone is attached as Exhibit D hereto. Pursuant to the Warrant and Order contained in 
 Exhibit D, the FBI subsequently obtained historical cell site and GPS location data for the Target 
 Cellphone. The collection of prospective location data pursuant to that Warrant and Order began 
 on or about June 30, 2020 and remains ongoing. 
 11. On the afternoon of June 30, 2020, and in the process of re-reviewing certain relevant 
 phone data in connection with another potential application, I realized that my June 29, 2020 Agent 
 Affidavit contained two inadvertent errors. First, the Agent Affidavit incorrectly stated that the 
 Target Cellphone had been in contact with a phone identified as the Isabel Maxwell Phone within 
 the last 30 days. In fact, the Target Cellphone was most recently in contact with the Isabel Maxwell 
 Phone in or about May 2020, or within the last 60 days, not the last 30 days. Second, the Agent 
 Affidavit incorrectly stated that the Target Cellphone had been in contact with a phone identified 
 as the Scott Borgerson Phone within the last 30 days. In fact, the Target Cellphone was most 
 recently in contact with the Scott Borgerson Phone in or about March 2020. The errors resulted 
 from my misreading of certain phone records for the Target Cellphone. In particular, while one 
 ' The original application also sought authorization for Cellphone Location and Pen Register 
 information for a second Target Cellphone, , which was identified as Target 
 Cellphone-1 in that application and which was also granted on or about June 29, 2020. Because 
 there were no errors in my affidavit with respect to Target Cellphone-1, this Amended Affidavit 
 does not seek a Second Warrant and Order with respect to that phone. 
 5 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020383
column in those records indicated that the Isabel Maxwell Phone and Scott Borgerson Phone had 
 themselves been active within the last 30 days, I mistook those dates to be the dates of those 
 phones' most recent contact with the Target Cellphone. I submit this Amended Agent Affidavit 
 now to inform the Court of the error, to set forth a corrected statement of the facts supporting 
 probable cause, and to seek a Second Warrant and Order authorizing the FBI to continue receiving 
 prospective location data for the Target Cellphone. 
 12. As detailed in my original affidavit, and based on my review of AT&T records, I have 
 learned that the Target Cellphone is subscribed in the name of "G Max," which appears to be a 
 shortened version of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's name. I further know from my review of AT&T 
 records the following: 
 a. The Target Cellphone has been active within the last 30 days. 
 b. The Target Cellphone has been in contact with a phone subscribed to the 
 business "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman," which I know from my review of court records is the 
 name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the 
 "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellphone 
 and the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
 c. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
 in the name of "Laura Menninger," which I know from my review of court records is the name of 
 an attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the "Laura 
 Menninger Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Laura 
 Menninger Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
 d. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
 in the name of "Isabel Maxwell," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database is 
 6 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020384
the name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the "Isabel Maxwell Phone"). The most recent 
 contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about 
 May 2020. 
 e. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
 in the name of "Scott Borgerson," which I know from my review of bank records and Amazon 
 records is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank 
 account and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within 
 approximately the last year (the "Scott Borgerson Phone"). The most recent contact between The 
 Target Cellular Device and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about March 2020. 
 13. Accordingly, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the 
 location of the Target Cellphone will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. 
 III. Request for Second Warrant and Order 
 14. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the Court require the Service 
 Provider to provide the Requested Information as specified further in the Second Warrant and 
 Order proposed herewith, including prospective precision location and cell site data for a period 
 of 45 days from the date of this Order, historical cell site data and toll records for the period from 
 June 1, 2020 through the date of this Order, and pen register information for a period of 45 days 
 from the date of this Order. 
 1. Nondisclosure. The scope of this ongoing criminal investigation and existence of 
 the Indictment and Arrest Warrant are not publicly known. As a result, premature public disclosure 
 of this affidavit or the requested Second Warrant and Order could alert GHISLAINE MAXWELL 
 that she is under investigation and subject to arrest, causing her to destroy evidence, flee from 
 prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. Specifically:

 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 The Government has moved for an order requiring David Markus to comply with Local 
 Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op-ed that he authored opining on the merits of this pending 
 case. Dkt. No. 309. 
 Mr. Markus is plainly a lawyer associated with the defense in this case. His formal 
 representation has involved handling at least one pre-trial issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular, 
 appeals to the Second Circuit of this Court's bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. 173; see also 
 United States v. Maxwell, Nos. 21-58-cr(L), 21-770-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held 
 himself out as Ms. Maxwell's attorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the 
 op-ed at issue in the Government's letter application, which describes him as "Maxwell's 
 appellate counsel." He has also attended a proceeding in this matter and spoken on Ms. 
 Maxwell's behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell's attorney. See 
 Stephen Rex Brown, Ghislaine Maxwell Makes First In-Person NYC Court Appearance, N.Y.

 arraignment-20210423-b3aza5eh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html. 
 Nevertheless Mr. Markus argues that he is not subject to Rule 23.1 because he does not 
 currently represent Ms. Maxwell in any proceedings and has not made an appearance in this

a. As evidenced by the charges alleged in the Indictment, MAXWELL is known 
 to have participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Alerting her to the existence and scope of 
 the investigation may lead her to intimidate witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(1),(4). 
 b. Additionally, the Target Subject is at liberty in the community. Premature 
 disclosure of the existence of this application and the charges contained in the Indictment could 
 result in the Target Subject fleeing from prosecution i f she were made aware of the pending charges 
 before arrest. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(2). 
 15. Accordingly, there is reason to believe that, were the Service Provider to notify the 
 subscriber or others of the existence of the warrant, the investigation would be seriously 
 jeopardized. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), I therefore respectfully request that the Service 
 Provider be directed not to notify the Subscriber or others of the existence of the Second Warrant 
 and Order for a period of one year, and that the Second Warrant and Order and all supporting 
 papers be maintained under seal until the Court orders otherwise, as specified in the Amended

 Federal Bureau of Investigation ("Investigative Agency") 
 Upon the Application and Agent Affidavit submitted by the Government in this matter: 
 I. Findings 
 The Court hereby finds: 
 1. The Target Cellphone (the "Target Cellphone") that is the subject of this Order is 
 assigned call number is subscribed to in the name of "G Max" (the "Subscriber"), 
 and is currently serviced by the Service Provider. 
 2. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1)(A) and the applicable provisions of Rule 41 of the 
 Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government's application sets forth probable cause to 
 believe that the prospective and historical location information for the Target Cellphone will reveal 
 the location of a person to be arrested for suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 2422, 2423(a), 
 and 1623 ("the Subject Offenses"). 
 3. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), the Government's application also sets forth specific 
 and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll records for 
 the Target Cellphone are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020387
4. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(1), the Government has certified that the pen register 
 information for the Target Cellphone is relevant to an ongoing investigation by the Investigating 
 Agency of GHISLAINE MAXWELL and others unknown in connection with suspected violations 
 of the Subject Offenses. 
 5. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), there is reason to believe that notification of the 
 existence of this Warrant and Order will result in flight from prosecution, and/or intimidation of 
 potential witnesses, or otherwise will seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121 et seq., 18 U.S.C. 
 §§ 2701 et seq., and 18 U.S.C. § 3103a, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: 
 H. Order to Service Provider 
 6. Service Provider. This Order shall apply to the Service Provider specified above, and 
 to any subsequent provider of service to the Target Cellphone without need for further Order of 
 this Court. 
 7. Prospective Location Information. The Service Provider shall provide to the 
 Investigating Agency on a prospective basis, for a period of 45 days from the date of this Order, 
 information concerning the location of the Target Cellphone ("Prospective Location 
 Information"), including all available: 
 a. precision location information, including GPS data, E-911 Phase II data, and 
 latitude -longitude data; and 
 b. cell site data, including any data reflecting (a) the cell towers and sectors thereof 
 utilized in routing any phone, text, or data communication to or from the Target Cellphone, and 
 (b) the approximate range of the target phone from the cell towers during the communication 
 (including per-call measurement ("PCM") or round-trip time ("RTT") data); 
 2 
 2019.07.24 
 EFTA00020388
8. Historical Location Information and Toll Records. The Service Provider shall 
 provide to the Investigating Agency all available historical cell site location information reflecting 
 the cell towers and sectors thereof utilized in routing any phone, text, or data communication to or 
 from the Target Cellphone, and the approximate range of the target phone from the cell towers 
 during the communication (PCM/RTT data), for the period from June I, 2020 through the present, 
 as well as all available toll records (including call detail, SMS detail, or data session detail records) 
 for the communications. 
 9. Pen register with caller identification and/or trap and trace device. The Service 
 Provider shall provide to the Investigating Agency, for a period of 45 days from the date of this 
 order, all dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated with each voice, text, or 
 data communication transmitted to or from the Target Cellphone, including but not limited to: 
 a. any unique identifiers associated with the phone, including ESN, MEIN, 
 MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI, SIM, MIN, or MAC address; 
 b. source and destination telephone numbers and/or Internet protocol ("IF') 
 addresses;' 
 c. date, time, and duration of the communication; and 
 d. cell-site information as specified above. 
 ' The Service Provider is not required to provide post-cut-through dialed digits ("PCTDD"), or 
 digits that are dialed after a telephone call from the Target Phone has been connected. If possible, 
 the Service Provider will forward only pre-cut-through-dialed digits to the Investigative Agency. 
 However, if the Service Provider's technical capabilities require it to forward all dialed digits, 
 including PCTDD, to the Investigative Agency, the Investigative Agency will only decode and 
 forward to the agents assigned to the investigation, the numbers that are dialed before the call is 
 cut through.

10. Technical Assistance. The Service Provider shall furnish the Investigating Agency all 
 information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the disclosure of all of the 
 foregoing information relating to the Target Cellphone unobtrusively and with the minimum 
 interference to the service presently provided to the Subscriber. 
 II. Non-Disclosure to Subscriber. The Service Provider, including its affiliates, officers, 
 employees, and agents, shall not disclose the existence of this Warrant and Order, or the underlying 
 investigation, to the Subscriber or any other person, for a period of one year from the date of this 
 Warrant and Order, subject to extension upon application to the Court, if necessary.

 13. Sealing. This Warrant and Order, and the supporting Application and Agent Affidavit, 
 shall be sealed until otherwise ordered by the Court, except that the Government may without 
 further order of this Court: serve this Warrant and Order on the Service Provider; provide copies 
 of the Warrant and Order or the supporting Application and Agent Affidavit as need be to 
 personnel assisting the Government in the investigation and prosecution of this matter; and 
 disclose these materials as necessary to comply with discovery and disclosure obligations in any 
 prosecutions related to this matter.

 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 As discussed in its previous order, the Court will hold an arraignment, initial conference, 
 and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. 
 Members of the press and the public in the United States may access the live audio feed of the 
 proceeding by calling 855-268-7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. 
 Those outside of the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214-416-0400 and 
 using the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately 500 
 callers on a first come, first serve basis. 
 The Court will provide counsel for both sides an additional dial-in number to be used to 
 ensure audio access to the proceeding for non-speaking co-counsel, alleged victims, and any 
 family members of the Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers 
 with information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will then 
 provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in access. 
 As the Court described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch 
 and listen to the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
 Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID-19, seating will be

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 16 Filed 07/09/20 Page 2 of 2 
 limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social distancing and ensure 
 public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government may contact Chambers by email if 
 there is a request to accommodate alleged victims or family members of the Defendant. 
 Members of the credentialed in-house press corps may contact the District Executive's Office 
 about seating. Otherwise, all seating will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in 
 accordance with the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous 
 order of July 7, 2020. See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes 
 that allowing for in-person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with 
 public health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. 
 Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is 
 prohibited by law. Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including 
 removal of court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to 
 future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court.

 Court. Dkt. No. 314. Rule 23.1 is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the 
 rule limits its application to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary, 
 as the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others) 
 "associated" with "pending or imminent criminal litigation." S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 
 23.1(a) (last updated Oct. 29, 2018); see also Rule 23.1(b) ("a lawyer participating in or 
 associated with the investigation"); Rule 23.1(c) ("lawyer or law firm associated with the 
 prosecution or defense"). An attorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently 
 "associated" with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial 
 statements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess 
 information that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold 
 greater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. 1982); see also People v. Buttajuoco, 
 599 N.Y.S.2d 419 (Nassau Cty. Ct. 1993). 
 Such is the case with Mr. Markus's role in the pending matter. As noted, Mr. Markus has 
 attended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell's behalf. 
 He has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court's pre-trial bail determinations. 
 Moreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell's appellate lawyer in a published 
 op-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which 
 includes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information 
 regarding the pending matter and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable. 
 Mr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1. 
 The Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and 
 the Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack of clarity 
 with respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule

 I haven't been able to find anything in which Maxwell's attorneys claim they don't know where Maxwell is. That 
 statement was only reported on (as best I can tell) in this article 
 (https://creativedestructionmed ia.cominews/politics/2020/01/23/ghisla i ne-maxwell s-lawyers-adm it-they-dont-know-
 where-she-is-either/), which refers to a letter filed with Judge Preska in January 2020, and dated December 2019. The 
 article claims that the letter admitted Maxwell's lawyers don't know where their client is. Maxwell's attorneys filed one 
 letter from that time period to Judge Preska that I've found. That letter does not include any suggestion that Maxwell's 
 counsel does not know where Maxwell is. Rather, the letter cites to newspaper articles about the frenzied attempts of 
 reporters to track Maxwell down. So seems that the article misrepresented the letter from Maxwell's attorneys. 
 In case it's helpful, though, I found a couple orders permitting alternative service because of plaintiffs' inability to serve 
 Maxwell. 
 Here is a text order in case approving alternative service after Maxwell's counsel refused to accept service. 
 06/15/2020 45 ORDER granting 43 Motion To Approve Alternate Service on Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell 
 ("Maxwell"). Plaintiffs motion is unopposed, and, based on Plaintiffs representations regarding 
 her unsuccessful efforts to locate Maxwell's current residence, her fruitless attempts to serve 
 Maxwell at multiple locations, her equally fruitless attempts to contact Maxwell via several 
 email addresses publicly associated with Maxwell, and her rejected request to Maxwell's 
 known litigation counsel to accept service on Maxwell's behalf, this Court finds that Plaintiff has 
 adequately demonstrated that she has made diligent efforts to effect service, and that personal 
 service would be impracticable. See Ransome v. Epstein, No. 17cv616 (JGK), 2018 WL 637421, 
 at *1 (S.D.NY. Jan. 30, 2018); see also Farmer v. lndyke, No. 19cv10475 (LGS)(DF) (Text Order, 
 dated Feb. 12, 2020). This Court further finds that Plaintiff's provision of a copy of the 
 Summons and Complaint by email to Maxwell's current counsel of record in the Farmer case 
 (see Declaration of Robert S. Glassman, dated May 27, 2020 (Dkt. 43-2), Ex. 3) was reasonably 
 calculated to place Maxwell on notice of this suit and to constitute sufficient service under the 
 circumstances presented here. No later than 6/18/20, Plaintiff is directed to serve Maxwell with 
 a copy of this Text Order by the same means (i.e., by email to Maxwell's counsel of record in the 
 Farmer case), and to file proof of such service on the Docket of this action. Maxwell may then 
 have until 7/9/20 to move, answer, or otherwise respond to the Complaint. (HEREBY ORDERED 
 by Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman)(Text Only Order) (Freeman, Debra) (Entered: 06/15/2020) 
 And here is a similar text order granting the same request a case after Maxwell's counsel refused to accept

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 Defendant. 
 COUNT ONE 
 SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
 S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 (Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
 Illegal Sex Acts) 
 The Grand Jury charges: 
 OVERVIEW 
 1. The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
 of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
 and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
 particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
 at least in or about 2004, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
 contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
 other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
 abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
 of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
 groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
 2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
 abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
 Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
 EFTA00020401
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 2 of 24 
 Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
 intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
 sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
 MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
 including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
 herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 3. During the time periods charged in this 
 Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
 professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
 closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
 in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
 Epstein. Additionally, between in or about 1994 and in or about 
 2004, MAXWELL was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
 properties. 
 4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
 engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
 means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
 a. MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
 Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
 asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
 families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
 friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
 2 
 EFTA00020402
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 3 of 24 
 victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
 involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
 victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
 time alone with a minor victim. 
 b. Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
 MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
 by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
 front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
 undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
 victim and Epstein. 
 c. MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
 interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
 minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
 Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
 was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
 massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
 MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
 including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
 be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
 Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
 d. In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
 minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
 opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
 Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
 3 
 EFTA00020403
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 4 of 24 
 indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
 help them. 
 e. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
 enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
 some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
 sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
 the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
 5. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
 about 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
 Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
 things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
 inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
 were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
 following: 
 a. A multi-story private residence on the Upper 
 East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the "New York 
 Residence") . 
 b. An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
 Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"). 
 c. A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
 Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"). 
 d. MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
 England.

 EFTA00020404
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 5 of 24 
 6. Additionally, beginning at least in or about 
 2001, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein 
 enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
 minor girls to visit Epstein's Palm Beach Residence to engage in 
 sex acts with Epstein, after which Epstein, MAXWELL, or another 
 employee of Epstein's would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
 in cash. Epstein and MAXWELL encouraged one or more of those 
 victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the 
 victim engage in sex acts with Epstein. Moreover, and in order 
 to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein, 
 MAXWELL, and other Epstein employees also paid certain victims 
 to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. 
 In this way, Epstein and MAXWELL created a network of underage 
 victims for him to sexually exploit. 
 7. Between at least in or about 2001 and in or about 
 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Epstein encouraged 
 and enticed one or more minor victims to engage in paid sex acts 
 with Epstein through a variety of means and methods, including 
 but not limited to the following: 
 a. Epstein's employees, including, at times, 
 MAXWELL, would call a victim to schedule an appointment for the 
 victim to massage Epstein at his Palm Beach Residence. MAXWELL 
 placed at least some of those calls while with Epstein in

 provides illustrative examples of statements that "presumptively involve a substantial likelihood 
 that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due 
 administration of justice within the meaning of the rule." S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23(d). 
 Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated with the pending case are now 
 clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.1. Indeed, 
 the above concerns do not apply only to Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that 
 "counsel[,] agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses" must take care to "protect 
 the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury." Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant 
 that criminal matters heading toward trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All 
 those associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they risk 
 being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of the upcoming 
 trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the impact it could have on this 
 matter, failure to comply could also result in attorney discipline. Id. Rule 23.1(i).

 Manhattan, New York. Epstein would often travel from New York 
 to Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments. 
 b. When a victim initially arrived at the Palm 
 Beach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee of 
 Epstein's, including, at times, MAXWELL. The victim would then 
 be escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the 
 victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN, 
 who would himself typically be naked. During these encounters, 
 EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical 
 contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and 
 indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would also 
 typically masturbate during these encounters, ask the victim to 
 touch him while he masturbated, and touch the victim's genitals 
 with his hands or with sex toys. 
 c. In connection with each sexual encounter, 
 Epstein or one of his employees or associates, including, at 
 times, MAXWELL, paid the victim in cash. Each victim was 
 typically paid hundreds of dollars for each encounter. 
 8. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
 Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
 sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
 engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
 resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
 touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals,

 placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
 directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
 directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
 MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
 9. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
 MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
 Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, Minor Victim-3, and Minor 
 Victim -4. In particular, and during time periods relevant to 
 this Indictment, MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among 
 others, with respect to minor victims: 
 a. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
 Victim -1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
 interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
 Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
 age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
 place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
 Victim -1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
 means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
 Victim -1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
 MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
 family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
 normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
 things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
 when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
 7 
 EFTA00020407
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 8 of 24 
 first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
 began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
 and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
 involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
 During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
 Victim -1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
 MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
 residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
 Victim -1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
 Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
 lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
 MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
 Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
 prcperties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
 b. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
 least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
 New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
 Victim -2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
 Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
 subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
 Victim -2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
 Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
 MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
 Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
 8 
 EFTA00020408
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 9 of 24 
 2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
 Victim -2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
 an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
 Victim -2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
 massage Epstein. 
 c. MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
 Victim -3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
 including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
 Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
 MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
 Victim -3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
 arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
 Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
 Victim -3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
 in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
 Victim -3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
 during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
 MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
 Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
 Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
 of a sexualized massage. 
 d. Minor Victim-4 was recruited to provide 
 Epstein with sexualized massages for which Minor Victim-4 was 
 paid by Epstein and/or one of his associates, including, at 
 9 
 EFTA00020409
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 10 of 24 
 times, MAXWELL, at the Palm Beach Residence beginning in or 
 around 2001. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-4 at Epstein's Palm Beach 
 Residence when Minor Victim-4 was approximately 14 years old. 
 MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-4 on multiple 
 occasions at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence, knowing that Minor 
 Victim -4 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these 
 interactions, which took place between approximately 2001 and 
 2004, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-4 to engage in sexual acts 
 with Epstein through multiple means. For example, MAXWELL asked 
 Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. 
 MAXWELL also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive 
 conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in 
 front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim-4 
 was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence. On 
 multiple occasions between approximately 2001 and 2004, Minor 
 Victim -4 provided nude massages to Epstein at the Palm Beach 
 Residence, during which Epstein engaged in multiple sex acts 
 with Minor Victim-4. Epstein's employees, including at times 
 MAXWELL, called Minor Victim-4, including from New York, to 
 schedule appointments for Minor Victim-4 to massage Epstein. 
 After each massage, Epstein or one of his employees, including 
 at times MAXWELL, paid Minor Victim-4 hundreds of dollars in 
 cash. At some point during this period, both Epstein and 
 MAXWELL invited Minor Victim-4 to travel with Epstein and 
 10 
 EFTA00020410
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 11 of 24 
 offered to assist Minor Victim-4 with obtaining a passport for 
 purposes of such travel, but Minor Victim-4 declined the 
 invitation. On multiple occasions between approximately 2001 
 and 2004, Epstein's employees, including at times MAXWELL, sent 
 Minor Victim-4 gifts, including lingerie, from an address in 
 Manhattan, New York to Minor Victim-4's residence in Florida. 
 Epstein and MAXWELL each also encouraged Minor Victim-4 to 
 recruit other young females to provide sexualized massages to 
 Epstein. In response, Minor Victim-4 brought multiple females, 
 including girls under the age of 18, to provide sexualized 
 massages for Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence. On such 
 occasions, both Minor Victim-4 and the girl she brought were 
 paid hundreds of dollars in cash. 
 MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
 10. In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
 as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
 repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
 regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the 
 abuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of the 
 specific events and acts of ab..:se detailed above.

 Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
 contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
 we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload

 Chris, 
 We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
 let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
 responses: 
 1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
 the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
 the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
 Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
 legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
 2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
 new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
 if you would like to provide one for us. 
 3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
 similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
 recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
 each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
 showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
 5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
 SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
 CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
 the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
 have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
 note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
 was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
 none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
 SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
 they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
 these images would not have CART numbers.

 We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
 call to discuss. 
 1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
 (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
 not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
 2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
 must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
 on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
 advise which way you would like to proceed. 
 3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
 the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
 missing attachments, if they exist. 
 4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
 by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
 afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
 "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
 provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 EFTA00020428
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
 These fall into the following buckets: 
 a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have

 Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
 contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
 we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload 
 those materials right away.

Subject: RE: Discovery Issues 
 Chris, 
 We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
 let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
 responses: 
 1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
 the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
 the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
 Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
 legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
 2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
 new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
 if you would like to provide one for us. 
 3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
 similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
 recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
 each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
 showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
 5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
 SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
 CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
 the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
 have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
 note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
 was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
 none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
 SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
 they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
 these images would not have CART numbers. 
 7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
 them.

 We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
 call to discuss. 
 1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
 (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
 not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
 2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
 must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
 on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
 advise which way you would like to proceed. 
 3. A number of the emails in the discovery— over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
 the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
 missing attachments, if they exist. 
 4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 —that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
 by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
 afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 5. A number of photographs — over 6500 —were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
 "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
 provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
 These fall into the following buckets: 
 a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
 "date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
 seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
 were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
 reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
 files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files.

 connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
 others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
 copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
 our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
 contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request.

 Good afternoon, 
 I spoke with and she can make herself available the following dates: 
 May 3, 4 (before 2pm), 5, 6, 12, 13 or 14. 
 She is going to take the day off of work, so no need to do it after-hours (thank you for the offer). Let me know if you 
 need additional availability.

 We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, 
 but our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue 
 to appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our 
 investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be 
 able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her 
 status as we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end.

 Just got the following update from (which I have conveyed ta: 
 • Within the last approximately 48 hours, MDC staff has conducted temperature checks in Ms. Maxwell's cell, all of 
 which revealed that the temperature in Ms. Maxwell's cell was between 71 and 74 degrees. MDC legal counsel 
 noted that the target temperature for the MDC during this season is 68 degrees. MDC staff also gave Ms. Maxwell 
 an extra blanket, so she now has three blankets in her isolation cell. 
 • MDC staff physically entered Ms. Maxwell's cell and did not observe any smell or moisture. The unit team leader 
 physically felt the papers in Ms. Maxwell's cell and observed that they felt normal and in no way damaged by 
 moisture. 
 • MDC staff will ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to bring a cup and a snack with her into her isolation cell.

The combination of cold, moisture, and sewage stench have made confinement 
 in her cell unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable. 
 Her request for an extra blanket has been denied. 
 Her request for use of her day mug for water has been denied. 
 (She's been told to cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.) 
 Her request to keep a snack in her cell has been denied. 
 The moisture accumulating in her cell risks her health and the security 
 of her legal work. 
 You have known me and my reputation among your colleagues and the court. 
 Trust me when I way that in my 35 years of federal criminal practice, having represented 
 individuals charged and convicted of terrorism and capital murder, housed in 
 MCC's 10South and FCI Florence-ADMAX (facilities I have visited), I have never witnessed 
 such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight. 
 The mistreatment of Ghislaine Maxwell reflects negatively on your Office, the Court, 
 and the BOP. The Government as a whole can and needs to do better. 
 For today, we seek the bare minimum - a change of cell to a location that is safe 
 from the cold, moisture, and stench, and an extra blanket to keep her warm. 
 The rest will be left for another day. 
 Please assist. 
 Thank you-

 Hi -
 or correct me if they have a better way but I think the best way to generate the Responsive Report 
 is to deselect (by removing the x in the column on the far left) all the data in the report and then go to the Tags view 
 and select (by putting the x back in the column on the far left) all your tags. You then go up to the top left and choose 
 the Report drop down and then choose Generate a New Report. Be sure to name it something that makes it clear that 
 it is the Responsive report and you can also choose whether to create a UFDR report or a PDF.

 I've finished the responsiveness review of the four reports that Reggie generated last week. I've tagged all of the 
 responsive items in each report. What should my next step be to generate reports that only include the tagged items? 
 Now that these are done, and I are all just waiting on the release of the remaining portions of 1872 and 
 1869, as well as any content from 1B71, 1883, and 1884. As soon as you can release even just some of those reports, 
 we will dive into the responsiveness review. 
 To give you a sense of timing: In order to give our paralegals enough time to prepare the responsive materials for 
 production in time for our 11/9 deadline, we need to finish the responsiveness review by no later than Thursday 11/5. 
 So the sooner we can get anything over the wall for us to review, the better.

 should not have chats and 1B69 should not have chats and should only have 1074 emails. And as always please stop 
 your review and let me know if you come across anything else that you think may be privileged. Thanks!

 Are you either of you in the office today? And if so, do you have time to help on this? It shouldn't take a lot of time. I 
 need the following reports released to the pros team: 
 1B72 — Release without chats 
 1867 — Release entire report 
 1868 — Release entire report 
 1869 — Release without chats and without the 93 PP emails, as tagged on the attached .pas file (so only release 
 1074 emails) 
 Thanks!

 several of Jeffrey Epstein's devicesMs going to leave a drive on your desk today, which contains data from 
 several of Epstein's phones and ipads. Would you please copy of all of that data onto a second drive? 
 Once the data is copied, we then need you to please mail one of the drives

 reply to this email with her mailing address). Please keep the second drive in your files in the officall then 
 reach out to you if she needs any additional help coordinating the review of that data for privileged materials.

 Hi everyone, 
 I've attached a summary/analysis of the Epstein trust documents we received. This document incorporates the analysis of 
 the trusts from 2019 I did previously. 
 On the bottom, you'll see each trust has a tab and then further amendments to the trust (if any) go chronologically to the 
 right. There's also key and summary tabs at the beginning of the document. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you'd like me to walk you through how to use the document, in case it 
 isn't clear. 
 Thanks, 
 p.s. I wouldn't recommend printing the document, just due to the size of the excel tables.

 We've only received the additional material today; it is voluminous which means we won't be in a position 
 for any meaningful conversation tomorrow. I suspect not before Friday either. Can we pencil in 3-4 pm on

 Mark — Hope you had a good weekend and just wanted to circle back on this. Realizing it is starting to get a bit late in the 
 day in London, would tomorrow morning (New York time) work for a follow up call on this? Perhaps around 10am our 
 time/3pm in London? If so, we can circulate another dial in.

 Hi Mark - Thanks for reaching out. We do have an active investigation and would be happy to talk. As you likely know, 
 today is a holiday in the US. Is this something we could discuss on Monday or is it more urgent than that? Thanks,

 Hi —
 Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into 
 Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth 
 division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is 
 handling ongoing work into Mr E's world ?

 In most cases, we had the agents interview the inmates without counsel after doing a Hammad memo. I've attached a 
 few examples. Where the inmate is a cooperator, we worked through the attorney. There were also two instances where 
 an inmate was not a cooperator but we worked through the attorney because of the nature of the defendant (both were 
 EDNY death eligible inmates).

 We are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the August 10, 2019 suicide of Jeffrey Epstein while in the 
 custody of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). In particular, we are 
 investigating MCC staff's (i) decision not to reassign a cellmate to Epstein on August 9, 2019, contrary to regular BOP 
 practice and direct orders from the Warden; (ii) the failure of correctional officers assigned to the Special Housing Unit 
 ("SHU") at which Epstein was housed the night of August 9, 2019, to perform the required overnight counts and 30-
 minute checks; and (iii) the falsification of records related to those count slips and 30-minute checks, in violation of Title 
 18, United States Code, Section 1519. 
 We are also investigating any efforts, following Epstein's death, to obstruct justice by destroying relevant records at MCC. 
 In particular, we learned today that all institutional count slips for dates prior to August 10, 2019, which we requested on 
 August 12, 2019, are apparently "missing." Today, we received a tip from a guard at MCC that while the guard was 
 stationed at the rear gate, inmate brought down bales of shredded paper on Thursday and Friday of last 
 week (August 15 and 16), and reported that he had been asked to shred documents by the BOP after-action team 
 (although it is not clear from the tip whether took part in any shredding) and that "they are shredding everything." 
 We would like to interview regarding these events. is a sentenced defendant who was prosecuted out of the 
 District and is currently serving a term of imprisonment related to 
 The assigned AUSA has no objection to us interviewing =. Investigating agents will seek to interview at 
 MCC, and will direct him not to discuss his prior criminal case or VOSR. We believe that will be more likely to 
 cooperate and be forthcoming in this setting, rather than going through his attorney. The proposed contact is permissible 
 under Hammad for several reasons. First, is not represented in connection with his status as a potential witness. 
 Second, agents will be instructed not ask any questions about his prior criminal case. Accordingly, the proposed 
 contact is permissible.

 Discussion: 
 We are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the August 10, 2019 apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein 
 while in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). In particular, we 
 are investigating MCC staff's (i) decision not to reassign a cellmate to Epstein on August 9, 2019, contrary to regular BOP 
 practice and direct orders from the Warden; (ii) the failure of correctional officers assigned to the Special Housing Unit 
 ("SHU") at which Epstein was housed the night of August 9, 2019, to perform the required overnight counts and 30-
 minute checks; and (iii) the falsification of records related to those count slips and 30-minute checks, in violation of Title 
 18, United States Code, Section 1519. We would like to have agents interview three inmates who were housed in the 
 same area of the SHU with Epstein on August 9 and 10, 2019, in order to discuss what they saw and heard that night, 
 including whether officers performed any overnight checks, or said or did anything upon discovering Epstein in his cell. 
 While we anticipate interviewing other cooperating witnesses who were in the SHU that night, no cooperating witness 
 was housed in the same area of the SHU as Epstein. Thus, these three inmates would be the most likely to have overheard 
 or seen something of relevance. While ten other inmates were housed in the same area as Epstein and these three 
 inmates, we have conferred with the AUSAs assigned to those matters and do not believe that those inmates would be 
 appropriate individuals to approach, given their pending charges. 
 Each of the three inmates is considered a potential witness in our investigation, and each is also currently being 
 prosecuted by our Office in connection with other crimes. Investigating agents will seek to interview the inmates at MCC, 
 will advise them of their Miranda rights prior to speaking with them, and will direct them not to discuss their ongoing 
 criminal case. None of the investigating agents have had any involvement in the investigations of the conduct for which 
 these individuals have already been charged, and they will make that clear to the inmates before trying to interview them. 
 Nor do we intend to ask any of the inmates about why they are in the SHU or about facts which may implicate them in 
 misconduct while housed at the MCC. Instead, our questioning will be narrowly focused on the general behavior of the 
 guards while the inmates have been housed in the SHU (including whether checks are or are not regularly done) and, 
 more specifically, the events on the night of August 9-10. We believe that the inmates may be more likely to cooperate 
 and be forthcoming in this setting, rather than going through their attorneys. An overview of each of the inmates is set 
 forth below. 
 • is currently charged by Indictment in

, in violation of-
 . His guidelines are months' imprisonment. His sentencing is 
 scheduled for . We have conferred with AUSAs and to 
 whom the case is assigned, and they have no objection to us proceeding in this manner. 
 The proposed contact is permissible under Hammad because the inmates are not represented in connection with their 
 status as potential witnesses to the events of August 9 and 10, 2019. Moreover, agents will be instructed to advise the 
 inmates of their Miranda rights, make clear they are not part of the investigation that gave rise to the inmates' pending 
 charges, not ask any questions about their open criminal cases, and direct the inmates not to speak about their open 
 criminal cases. Additionally, while there is no question that the Sixth Amendment, including its right to counsel, ordinarily 
 applies at the point of indictment, none of these defendants have been indicted for the conduct about which we propose 
 to question them. Nor, as noted, do we intend to question them about anything that might require them to implicate 
 themselves in misconduct while being housed as a result of the crimes for which they have previously been charged. 
 Accordingly, we believe the proposed contact is permissible.

 Nude Photos of Underage Girls Seized From Jeffrey

 Investigators seized nude photographs of underage girls from the Manhattan townhouse of Jeffrey Epstein 
 as part of a new investigation into allegations he exploited dozens of minors for sex, prosecutors revealed 
 on Monday. 
 That detail was mentioned by federal prosecutors on Monday as they unsealed an indictment charging Mr. 
 Epstein with sex trafficking and made an appeal to other women who may have been abused by him to 
 come forward. 
 "They deserve their day in court and we are proud to stand up for them by bringing this indictment," the 
 United States attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, said. 
 Mr. Epstein, 66, is accused of engaging in sex acts with dozens of vulnerable minors, some as young as 14, 
 during naked massage sessions, then paying them hundreds of dollars in cash. He also asked some of the

 United States Courthouse 
 40 Foley Square 
 New York, New York 10007 
 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of 
 August 17, 2020 (the "Defense Letter"), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the 
 defendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the "Civil Cases") discovery materials produced 
 by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other 
 discovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should 
 be denied.' 
 As an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce, 
 substantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include 
 materials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative 
 methods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more 
 than 165,000 pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense 
 Letter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated 
 civil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated 
 "Confidential" thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government's designation is entirely 
 appropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by 
 the issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
 ' The Government has drafted this letter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed 
 materials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to 
 seal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Letter repeatedly references, and attaches as 
 exhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if 
 filed publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate letter, under seal, proposing redactions 
 to the Defense Letter and requesting that the attachments to the Defense Letter be filed under seal. 
 EFTA00017805
girls to recruit other underage girls, the indictment said. 
 "In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations 
 including New York and Palm Beach," the indictment said. 
 Mr. Berman's decision to seek an indictment in Manhattan was an implicit rebuke to the decision by 
 prosecutors in Miami in 2008 to enter an agreement with Mr. Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal 
 prosecution and a possible life sentence. 
 Under that deal, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and spent about a year in a Palm 
 Beach jail. He was permitted to leave the facility six days a week to work. 
 Mr. Berman made it clear his office was not bound by the agreement, which was overseen by Alexander 
 Acosta, then the United States attorney in Miami who is now President Trump's secretary of labor. 
 "That agreement, by its terms, only binds the Southern District of Florida," Mr. Berman said. 
 The agreement has been examined in a series of reports in The Miami Herald and is being challenged in 
 court. A federal judge ruled earlier this year Mr. Epstein's accusers should have been consulted about the 
 deal before it was signed. 
 The indictment unsealed in Manhattan on Monday said that from 2002 to 2005 Mr. Epstein and his 
 employees engaged in a sex trafficking scheme, bringing underage girls to his Upper East Side mansion 
 and his palatial compound in Palm Beach, Fla., to engage in sex acts with him. 
 The indictment said Mr. Epstein used employees and assistants to arrange sexual rendezvous with at least 
 one girl at his New York residence and two at his home in Palm Beach. 
 Mr. Epstein is accused of having the girls perform nude massages, at which point he would masturbate and 
 touch their genitals with his hands or with sex toys. 
 The girls were paid hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter and, once recruited, were asked to 
 return to the mansion several times, where they were abused again, the indictment said. Mr. Epstein, the 
 court documents read, "created a similar network of minor girls to victimize" in Florida. 
 "This conduct, as alleged, went on for years and involved dozens of young girls, some as young as 14," 
 Mr. Berman said. "The alleged behavior shocks the conscience." 
 [Read the indictment.] 
 The charges unsealed Monday by the Southern District of New York signal a prosecution that some of his 
 accusers have been awaiting for years. 
 Accusations of pedophilia and sexual predation have dogged Mr. Epstein for decades. And now, in the 
 #MeToo era, his case has been held up as a prime example of insulated, powerful men avoiding 
 accountability. 
 For more than a decade, Mr. Epstein, a hedge fund manager, avoided a lengthy prison sentence, largely 
 because of the agreement his lawyers struck with federal prosecutors in 2008. 
 Mr. Epstein's social circle is filled with other high-profile connections, including to former President Bill Clinton, Prince 
 Andrew of Britain and a host of others. 
 In 2002, Mr. Trump described Mr. Epstein as "a terrific guy." 
 "He's a lot of fun to be with," Mr. Trump told New York Magazine. "It is even said that he likes beautiful 
 women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." 
 EFTA00018156
On Saturday, F.B.I. agents and New York Police Department officers used a crow bar to force open the wooden doors of 
 Mr. Epstein's East 71st Street mansion. 
 The charges unsealed Monday mirror those that federal prosecutors had prepared in Miami against Mr. 
 Epstein more than a decade ago. In 2005, law enforcement officials there investigated Mr. Epstein after the 
 parents of one of his accusers reported an incident to the police. 
 As first reported in The Miami Herald last year, prosecutors had prepared a 53-page indictment accusing 
 Mr. Epstein of being a sexual predator. But those charges were shelved in 2008 after an eleventh-hour deal 
 was reached between the United States attorney's office in Miami and Mr. Epstein's lawyers. 
 The plea agreement granted Mr. Epstein immunity from federal prosecution and let him plead guilty to two 
 prostitution charges in state court. Federal prosecutors arranged for the plea deal to be kept secret from Mr. 
 Epstein's accusers until it was finalized in court. 
 In April, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had violated the law in offering the plea agreement without 
 informing Mr. Epstein's accusers. The Justice Department also opened a probe into the incident in 
 February.

 Hey 
 Here are the documents you requested in regards to my investigation into Mr. Epstein. 
 On March 15, 2019 Mr. Epstein signed the Virgin Islands sex offender registry Notification of Duty to Report Travel (IML) 
 form. 
 EFTA00018159
On March 22, 2019 Mr. Epstein travelled to Vienna, Austria where he and three (3) female passengers went to coffee and 
 it appears this travel was not reported. 
 On April 25, 2019 Mr. Epstein travelled to Morocco and it appears this travel was not reported. 
 Please note if this information is made public I strongly believe it may hamper our ability to confirm this information as 
 the investigation is ongoing. Especially with his resources. 
 Any questions, please contact me.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 46 Filed 08/21/20 Page 2 of 5 
 Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 21, 2020 
 Page 2 
 In particular, the Defense Letter seeks this Court's authorization to use materials relating 
 to applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other 
 judicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit 
 compliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the "Subpoenas"). Those Subpoenas were issued 
 to a certain recipient (the "Recipient") after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into 
 Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its 
 standard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued 
 the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government 
 that it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in 
 or about February 2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to 
 request modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas. 
 In or about April 2019, one court ("Court-1") granted the Government's application, and permitted 
 that the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further 
 dissemination —to the Recipient. 2 Subsequently, the second court ("Court-2") denied the 
 Government's application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both 
 Court -1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal, 
 except that both have expressly permitted the Government to produce those filings to the defendant 
 as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Letter now seeks to use 
 those discovery materials in the Civil Cases. 
 At base, the defendant's application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process 
 of criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the 
 criminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is 
 to enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of 
 materials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an 
 effort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It 
 should be denied for multiple reasons. 
 First, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides 
 that any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of 
 designation, "[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the 
 defense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the 
 defense of this action." Protective Order 11 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed, 
 the defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her own proposed protective order. 
 This was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See 
 Defendant's Proposed Protective Order ¶ 1(a) (Dkt. 29-1). Yet less than a month later, the 
 defendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the 
 2 In the Defense Letter, the defendant argues that the Government "must have given a copy of the 
 sealed order" to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the 
 Government's statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant's 
 suggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2019 and was issued for 
 the purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision 
 that it could be transmitted to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient 
 well over a year before it became "discovery" in this criminal case.

 July 11, 2019 
 Jeffrey Epstein, the financier facing sex-trafficking charges in New York, has been described by 
 prosecutors as a man of enormous wealth: He owns a $77 million mansion on the Upper East Side, a $12 
 million estate in Palm Beach, Fla., a private island in the Caribbean and a private jet, they said. 
 And on Thursday, Mr. Epstein, 66, asked a federal judge to allow him to use some of his wealth to stay out 
 of jail while he awaits trial, filing a detailed bail proposal with the court. 
 Mr. Epstein asked the court to release him on substantial bond and pledged to put up his palatial 
 Manhattan townhouse and his private jet as collateral. He also proposed he be allowed to remain under 
 house arrest in his Upper East Side house, and said he would agree to electronic monitoring of his 
 location. He said he would surrender his passport and ground his jet. 
 In addition, his lawyers proposed that Mr. Epstein would hire private round-the-clock security guards who 
 would "virtually guarantee" that he would not flee his house and would show up for court. 
 A handful of superrich defendants have sought and occasionally obtained, over sharp objections from the 
 government, similar bail provisions that allow them to finance a kind of personal jail rather than being 
 held in a government lockup. 
 Such bail packages have prompted intense debate about their fairness. The judge in Mr. Epstein's case, 
 Richard M. Berman, rejected a similar  proposal in 2016 from a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader in a 
 money laundering case. 
 At the time, Judge Berman wrote that the proposal was "unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity 
 and unequal treatment in favor of a very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy." 
 Prosecutors had said on Monday after the charges were announced that they would ask to have Mr. Epstein 
 held in jail until his trial. They said in court that he posed "an extraordinary risk of flight and danger," and 
 that he had "nearly infinite means" and "tremendous incentives to use those means to flee prosecution." 
 Judge Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan is scheduled to take up Mr. Epstein's bail proposal at 
 a hearing on Monday. 
 Mr. Epstein was arrested Saturday night aboard a private jet at Teterboro Airport after arriving from Paris. 
 He has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a high-security facility in Lower Manhattan 
 where accused terrorists, mobsters and, most recently, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, have 
 awaited trial. 
 If convicted, Mr. Epstein faces up to 45 years in prison on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. The 
 indictment unsealed on Monday by Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said that 
 between 2002 and 2005, Mr. Epstein recruited dozens of underage girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
 after which he paid them hundreds of dollars in cash. 
 The indictment also accused Mr. Epstein of encouraging some of his victims to recruit other underage girls 
 that he could then abuse, and paying his "victim-recruiters" hundreds of dollars for each girl that they 
 brought to him. "In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit," the 
 indictment said.

 Trump Doesn't Know About Labor 
 Thank (io,i ve got so many inept cabinet members.

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Wednesday publicly defended his role in overseeing the prosecution of 
 Jeffrey Epstein.CreditCreditAnna Moneymaker/The New York Times 
 So, did you enjoy the parade for the U.S. women's soccer team? People sure did seem happy. I believe this is 
 partly because the players are terrific and partly because many Americans are desperate to think about something 
 other than Donald Trump. 
 And, good Lord, his crack team of cabinet members. On Wednesday, Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta tried to 
 hold back the outrage that's been building since people learned that, as a federal prosecutor in South Florida, he 
 had brokered a very lenient punishment for Jeffrey Epstein, a rich guy who liked to have sex with underage girls. 
 Explanation: It was a good deal. You know how this administration feels about good deals. 
 "The Palm Beach state attorney's office was ready to let Epstein walk free," Acosta said in his calm, sort of 
 toneless voice. "Our prosecutors ... presented the ultimatum." Which was that Epstein, who had molested a 
 parade of teenagers, some only 14, had to serve at least a little jail time. The punishment Acosta wrangled with 
 his alleged best possible efforts involved 13 months in prison, during which Epstein was free to spend most days 
 at his office as long as he slept overnight in the clink. 
 The victims had no idea that might be the end of the story. The case is now in the hands of federal prosecutors in 
 New York who are going after Epstein on other sex-trafficking charges. (You may have noticed that over the last 
 few years virtually everything that happens in this country winds up in the hands of New York prosecutors.) 
 Do you think Acosta ever asked himself whether he could have fought harder? Nah. The problem was the 
 victims, who were too "scared and traumatized" to be good witnesses. Asked by reporters if he had any regrets, 
 he just said that was "a very hard question." 
 Have you heard anybody in the Trump administration apologize for anything? Well, there was the occasion the 
 secretary of health and human services said he was sorry he spent $400,000 of our tax dollars to fly around in 
 specially chartered planes. But that was a long time and a whole lot of bad behavior ago. 
 About Jeffrey Epstein. He sounds like one of the worst people imaginable, so we are, of course, stunned to hear 
 he used to be tight with our current chief executive. "Terrific guy," Trump said in an interview with New York 
 magazine in 2002. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and 
 many of them are on the younger side." 
 The palship no longer exists. "I had a falling-out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of 
 his, that I can tell you," said the president, who appears to have erased the lot-of-fun-to-be-with period. 
 Are you shocked by any of this? Hey, early in our acquaintanceship we learned Trump is a guy who bragged 
 about being so important he could get away with grabbing women by their private parts. Who was put into office 
 thanks to Russian manipulation of our election. Some days you just want to sigh and talk a lot about women's 
 soccer. 
 Ever since the Epstein scandal arose, Trump has been defending Acosta, stressing what an "excellent" job he's 
 doing. After all, the president told reporters, "our economy is so good, our unemployment numbers are at record 
 lows." You might have thought he was under the impression the secretary of labor had something to do with 
 boosting the economy. As opposed to things like workplace safety and collecting job statistics. 
 And oh, yeah, human trafficking. Very embarrassing that Acosta is one of the people who's supposed to protect 
 underage women from being sold as sex slaves. 
 Hmm. Before this week, what do you think Donald Trump thought the Department of Labor did? 
 A) Something about delivering babies. 
 B) Something about getting good people to, you know, mow the lawn and stuff. 
 C) Something. 
 The president is oblivious, but otherwise almost nobody likes the job Acosta's been doing. People who care 
 about workers are naturally outraged that he's been trying to water down everything from mine safety regulations 
 to the rules that prohibit restaurant managers from grabbing a piece of the waiters' tips.
 Trump insiders, of course, feel undermining workers' rights is supposed to be Acosta's mission. And they 
 complain he's been sort of inept at it. Mick Mulvaney, the Trump Acting Chief of Staff For Life, has been trying 
 to take control. Recently, Acosta's chief of staff was pushed out for a lack of, um, leadership. Or, as one former 
 administration official told Politico, "There are times when he goes completely loony." 
 You've got to be appalled by Acosta's failure to stand up for vulnerable children being lured into serving as sex 
 playthings for a man who truly does epitomize the concept of filthy rich. 
 But are you upset that Trump is too much of an ethical beanbag to get rid of him? The sad truth is that we're 
 really probably better off with cabinet members too inept to accomplish anything at all.

 Government in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably 
 applies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here. 
 Second, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective 
 order that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal 
 discovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allow the 
 defendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those 
 that are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third 
 parties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly 
 concerned about the defendant's interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her 
 counsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly 
 inappropriate for defense counsel to be permitted to sift through the criminal case discovery and 
 cherry -pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend 
 against accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-
 sealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time. 
 And yet that is what the defendant proposes. 
 Third, the specific documents at issue pertain to a parte applications made as part of an 
 ongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain 
 under seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those 
 matters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Letter, remain sealed? As 
 the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the 
 investigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of 
 Jeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, however, have not 
 been made public.' Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were 
 produced under a "Confidential" designation. Any argument that such materials are not 
 "confidential" would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also 
 misapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.5 See, 
 3 The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (1) as noted above, the permission from Court-1 
 to provide the April 2019 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions 
 the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the 
 record relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The 
 defendant's claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without 
 any application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect. 
 To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the 
 nature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental 
 letter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an 
 explanation. 
 5 Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are 
 improperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-1 and 
 Court -2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because

 I can certainly send you the court order on the bail determination once it's issued. If you haven't gotten it from me by 
 later next week, could you please just remind me? I don't want it to get lost in the avalanche of current stuff. 
 Also just to note, we obviously have no position (or request, directive, hint, nod, or wink) whatsoever regarding his 
 passport —we don't know what that process is so we completely defer on the substance. But of course happy to get you 
 the order, and let us know if anything else would be helpful.

 The State Department has gotten several inquires regarding Epstein's passport. He currently has one valid 
 passport and Consular Affairs (CA) would like to revoke it. 
 I understand he will have a bail hearing on Monday. Would you be able to send me the court order (even if he is 
 remanded) so CA can revoke to the book? I assume if he is released on bail there will be a travel restriction 
 imposed/surrender of his passport.

 FYI : The Domestic Agencies who supply the Staff to the rich and famous, cover up crimes in order to collect 
 fee's and to continue doing business. 
 They send Staff for interviews knowing fine well that the client is either violent, a drunk/ drug abuser, 
 physically/ verbally abusive, or even YES, a pedophile. 
 MANY very rich clients ask for "Pretty Staff' and often they are sexual harassed on a daily basis in return for 
 monies favors, etc. 
 For example "Do this for me, and your family in the Philippines will be able to buy that house" 
 These very rich families have the Staff sign "Confidentiality Clauses" and then have their lawyers scare the hell 
 out of any Staff Members who dares to answer back, criticize, or threaten to go to the Police or the Press, as the 
 lawyers threaten the Staff with the "Confidentiality Papers" and say things like "You will NEVER work 
 again, and we will take your house, or apt away from you with Court costs so shut up" 
 Then the same lawyers hand checks to disgruntled, or abused Domestic Workers as a pay-off to shut up and to go 
 away and the Domestic Agencies then are told to blacklist the individual. 
 This is how 5th and Park Avenue operate and yes, even CPW and Tribeca 
 THEN to top it off the Domestic Agencies then threaten the Staff and say "If you dare to go to the Police, or 
 the Press, or even the US Attorneys Office, we will blacklist you and no Agency will ever work with you ever 
 again" 
 How do you think Epstein and so many others get away with abuse for so long 
 999999???
 It is designed that way. All are scared to talk and all are threatened one way or another. 
 The US Attorneys Office could expose this, and for sure the damn will burst wide open on the likes of Seinfeld, 
 Kalikow, Black, Soros, and many many more,,,,,,,,, 
 The Domestic Agencies are just as guilty as the Clients who are up to no good, as they are licensed and bonded, 
 and should know better. 
 They cover up for the Clients, and even work with the lawyers of the rich to defend the rich from any legal cases 
 against them. 
 The key to all the abuse by the rich and famous in NYC is for the Domestic Employee's to feel safe to walk into 
 the US Attorney's Office any time and file a complaint. 
 NOT the 19th Precinct who cover up for the rich,,,,,,,,,,,, as the rich are very cunning, and offer ex Detectives 
 cushy jobs as Driver/ Security when they retire from the 19th 
 EFTA00018180
No, the US Attorneys Office need to have an open door for employee's of the rich and famous, so that they can 
 feel safe. 
 The NYPD are hired by the rich, so there is a bias 
 No US Attorney ever goes to work for a Celebrity as a Security/ Driver detail 
 Allow Domestic Workers a safety net to walk into your office, regardless of "Confidentiality Clauses" and you 
 will hear it all 
 Trust me, it's not pretty. 
 Epstein is NOT alone in NYC The abuse is all over From sexual to major tax evasion. Suitcases 
 of cash taken onto private planes.... and more

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 46 Filed 08/21/20 Page 4 of 5 
 Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 21, 2020 
 Page 4 
 e.g., United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) ("As a general proposition, 
 courts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are 
 presumptively accessible, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might 'adversely affect 
 law enforcement interests.") (citing United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050)); see also 
 United States v. Park, 619 F. Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that the need to "maintain 
 the secrecy of the Government's investigation" outweighed the public's right of access to certain 
 sentencing documents). 
 Fourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal 
 defendant should be permitted to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the 
 Government aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—
 perhaps because few defendants attempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, 15 Cr. 
 025, 2017 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. I, 2017) (discussing the relative lack of specific 
 guidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also 
 United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 721 (5th Cir. 2015) ("[m]otions to modify protective 
 orders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent"), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of 
 blurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant attempts here. See 
 Calderon, 2017 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant's application for modification of a 
 criminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOIA suit); United States 
 v. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2020 WL 1495880, at *2-.3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2020) (denying 
 a defendant's motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of 
 pursuing claims in a civil action, even following the completion of trial). 
 Absent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion, 
 makes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In 
 particular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant's argument that the 
 Government secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling 
 the defendant. That is how grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense 
 counsel's overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the 
 Government obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about 
 the manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested. 
 Certainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has 
 engaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to 
 suggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to 
 circumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case. 
 In any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant's civil adversary has access 
 to is the lone April 2019 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil 
 Cases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make 
 similar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government 
 obtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently 
 they recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury 
 investigation.

 requested —the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously 
 oppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case. 
 Finally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehow necessary 
 to her ability to bring issues to the attention of other courts, the Defense Letter completely fails to 
 explain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery 
 materials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil 
 Cases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization 
 for compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the 
 Civil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that 
 courts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the 
 defendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in 
 those cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of 
 malfeasance.' 
 In sum, the defendant's arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the 
 relevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court 
 to permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate 
 a civil case. Accordingly, the application in the Defense Letter should be denied.

 If anything, the Defense Letter suggests that the defendant intends to use criminal discovery 
 materials to attack the Government in the Civil Cases, attacks of no discernable relevance in those 
 cases and made in a forum in which the Government is not a party and would have no opportunity 
 to respond.

 (I) In General. A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects the subpoena 
 designates. The court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be offered in 
 evidence. When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them. 
 (2) Quashing or Modifying the Subpoena. On motion made promptly, the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance 
 would be unreasonable or oppressive.

 subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court 
 order. Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that 
 the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object. 
 (d) Service. A marshal, a deputy marshal, or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena. The server must deliver a copy 
 of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day's witness-attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance. The server

 States. 
 (2) In a Foreign Country. If the witness is in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. § 1783 governs the subpoena's service. 
 (g) Contempt. The court (other than a magistrate judge) may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena 
 issued by a federal court in that district. A magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a 
 subpoena issued by that magistrate judge as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 636(e).

Independent 
 Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
 PROTOCOL 
 May 29, 2020 
 I. PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW 
 The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") is a voluntary, independent Program that 
 has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by 
 Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). 
 The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Estate") has retained the services of nationally recognized claims 
 administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the 
 Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the "Administrator"). This 
 Protocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and 
 representatives of the Estate. 
 Through the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and 
 offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse. 
 The Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
 • The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have 
 unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
 Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop 
 participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution 
 of the Release. 
 • The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or 
 overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to 
 the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the 
 Program. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to 
 determine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. 
 Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to 
 review or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity. 
 • There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to 
 compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to 
 each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the 
 Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive 
 discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will 
 pay all eligible claims based on the Administrators determination. 
 I I Page 
 EFTA00018200
• All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to 
 race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To 
 ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process 
 so that all Claimants can equally access the Program's claim process. Individuals 
 with disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their 
 claims and to request special process accommodations. 
 The Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were 
 harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they 
 have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. 
 The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
 determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date ("Filing Deadline"). All 
 individual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period. 
 To complement the Program's resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent 
 of the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert, 
 leading legal academic and advocate of victims' rights. Ms. Hamilton's role will be to further inform the 
 Administrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse, 
 and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or 
 updating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in 
 interactions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-
 determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The 
 Administrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant's prior written consent, request that Ms. 
 Hamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in 
 her discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants' files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton. 
 As set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration 
 of the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims 
 submitted to the Program. 
 During the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her 
 representatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton 
 will maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains 
 through her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants' submissions.

 EFTA00018201
II. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 
 A. Eligibility Criteria 
 The persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused 
 by Epstein. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
 • The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein. 
 • An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may 
 participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met. 
 • An individual who previously entered into a settlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual 
 abuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are 
 met. 
 • An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may 
 participate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual 
 acted under duress as a result of her own sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other 
 eligibility criteria are met. 
 • If the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with 
 prejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities 
 and/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or 
 prior to the signed acceptance of the compensation determination offer letter and executed 
 Release in order to receive payment. 
 B. Legal Representatives of Claimants 
 An individual may file a claim on a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority 
 to act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The "Legal Representative" of an 
 individual Claimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal 
 guardian authorized by law to serve as the minor's legal representative; (2) in the case of an 
 incompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's 
 legal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person 
 who has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's estate by a court of 
 competent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an attorney authorized to 
 represent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program. 
 Legal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such 
 proof may include a power of attorney; documentation showing the individual's appointment as 
 guardian or guardian ad litem; documentation showing the individual's appointment as personal 
 representative of the Claimant's estate (such as letters of administration); a copy of a retainer 
 Wage 
 EFTA00018202
agreement showing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the attorney or a signed 
 statement by an adult Claimant and the attorney that a licensed/admitted attorney is acting on her 
 behalf. 
 III. CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION 
 A. Claims Submission Process 
 Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
 otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the 
 Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions 
 for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed 
 a lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to 
 be eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain 
 free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals 
 must, however, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at 
 the time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment. 
 Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
 not otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before 
 the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at 
 www.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire setting forth their 
 name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested 
 information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the 
 individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is 
 eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant 
 Program information. 
 Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates 
 that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It 
 does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive 
 compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has 
 been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. 
 Registrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the 
 Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their attorney to the 
 Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective 
 Date through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline ("Registration Deadline"). It is important 
 to note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained 
 above, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline. 
 4IPage 
 EFTA00018203
All Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant's ability and filed no later than the Filing 
 Deadline. Claim Forms should be uploaded to the Program website at www.EpsteinVCP.com, or mailed 
 via overnight courier (a pre-paid courier voucher will be included with each packet) to the Administrator 
 at the following address: 
 Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
 Attn: Jordana H. Feldman, Administrator 
 Claimants are invited to provide documentation identified in the Claim Form, and any other 
 corroborating or supporting information sufficient to substantiate the claim, satisfy eligibility 
 requirements, and allow the Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. If the claim is 
 being presented by a Legal Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for 
 submitting the necessary documentation relating to the represented Claimant. 
 Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant 
 and the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed 
 relevant to the Administrator's evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator's 
 final disposition of the claim. 
 If a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant, 
 explain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant's Legal 
 Representative (where applicable) to assist in submitting a complete claim. 
 B. Claims Evaluation and Determination 
 Claims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each 
 submitted individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all 
 required documentation has been submitted to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to 
 Claimant's good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation. 
 1. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims 
 As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
 information available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will 
 consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
 • The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the 
 nature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the 
 age of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include 
 (i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and 
 (ii) contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the 
 abuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others. The 
 SIPage 
 EFTA00018204
Administrator acknowledges that some Claimants may not be able to provide any 
 documentation to corroborate their Claim based on the nature and circumstances of Epstein's 
 conduct. If a Claimant's written and oral presentation is deemed to be credible by the 
 Administrator, the Claimant may still be eligible for compensation under the Program. 
 • Whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate 
 Office of the District Attorney, United States Attorney's Office, or other law enforcement 
 agency. 
 • Whether the Administrator finds the claims of the individual to be credible after complete 
 review of all relevant documentation and other evidence provided by the Claimant and the 
 Estate. 
 As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
 information available, the amount of compensation that should be offered to each eligible Claimant. 
 The Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited 
 to: 
 • The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the Claimant. 
 • The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse. 
 • The nature and extent of the Claimant's physical or psychological damage resulting from the 
 sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual abuse on the Claimant. 
 • The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and circumstances, supporting 
 documentation and corroborating evidence. 
 • Whether the Claimant previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and 
 received a payment pursuant to such agreement. 
 The Administrator will confidentially send the Claimant a compensation determination offer letter 
 including the following: (1) the Administrator's eligibility decision regarding the claim; (2) the amount of 
 compensation offered; (3) a Release to be signed by the Claimant if the Claimant accepts the offered 
 compensation; and (4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer shall be valid for 60 days from 
 the date of the compensation determination offer letter. 
 The Administrators determinations in this Program will not be binding on any potential criminal 
 investigation involving Claimant's claims. 
 2. Opportunities to be Heard 
 The Claimant will be afforded an opportunity to be heard, either before or after the Administrator 
 renders her determination. Upon request by the Claimant, the Administrator will be available to meet in 
 person (as practicable in light of the COVID-19 pandemic), by video conference, or by teleconference to

further discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet 
 with the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EosteinVCP.com and will be 
 scheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting 
 with a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location, 
 though the Claimant is not obligated to attend any such meeting. 
 3. Release 
 By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations 
 of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the 
 Release. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the 
 Claimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all 
 past and future claims (including Ifs pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of 
 sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the 
 offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time 
 prior to the execution of the Release. 
 The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries 
 may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related 
 entities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to 
 participate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However, 
 the Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant's ability to report and discuss 
 allegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the 
 Release will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permitted to 
 discuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose. 
 Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney selected by the Claimant. If the 
 Claimant is not represented by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal 
 counseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and 
 binding nature of the Release. 
 No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under 
 the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding 
 tax liability for payments pursuant to the Program. 
 4. Payments 
 Upon the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's receipt of 
 the Claimant's executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing 
 lawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the 
 Administrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as 
 directed by the Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. All 
 71 Page 
 EFTA00018206
payments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant's physical injuries, physical sickness and 
 resulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section 104(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 C. Program Integrity 
 For the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible 
 Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent 
 claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies, 
 irregularities or duplication. 
 Each Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information 
 provided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the 
 Claimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may 
 result in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be 
 potentially fraudulent or to contain information known by the Claimant to be false when made will be 
 forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the 
 District Attorney and/or United States Attorney's Office for possible investigation and prosecution. 
 D. Confidentiality/Privacy 
 The Program is confidential.1 By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal 
 Representative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by the Claimant pursuant to 
 the Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the 
 following purposes: 
 I) Processing and evaluating the Claimant's claim; 
 2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and 
 3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims. 
 When documents or other information maintained or submitted by the Estate become part of a 
 Claimant's file for purposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to 
 assist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. No information 
 provided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant's name and the date(s) 
 and location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and, 
 for purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant 
 alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained 
 solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any 
 claim, regardless of forum. The Program's files are not available for inspection, review or copying by 
 the Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent 
 All parties agree that they are using the services of a third•party administrator to help reach a resolution of Individual claims 
 of sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, settlement and all other pertinent 
 privileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law. 
 8IPage 
 EFTA00018207
mediation privileges, settlement privileges and other privileges apply. 
 To protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by 
 the Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of 
 the Program. 
 Individual Claimants are not bound through the Program by any rules of confidentiality. Claimants may, 
 at their sole and voluntary option, disclose information in their possession regarding their claim, their 
 compensation and their experience with the Program. 
 All confidentiality requirements are subject to law, regulation and judicial process. 
 E. Reporting 
 The Administrator shall, on a monthly basis, confidentially provide reports regarding the number and 
 total value of claims paid each month to the Probate Court of the United States Virgin Islands and the 
 Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands. Such reports will report on an aggregate level 
 only. No individual Claimant information will be published or disclosed in a way that compromises 
 Claimant confidentiality.

 created, manufactured or possessed by the United States Inspector General. 
 Please see U.S. v. Bryan, 868 F.2d 1032 (1989) if you maintain that Mr. Thomas is not

AO 89B (07/16) Subpoena to Produce Documents, Information, or Objects in a Criminal Case (Page 3) 
 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective 12/1/08) 
 (c) Producing Documents and Objects. 
 (I) In General. A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects the subpoena 
 designates. The court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be offered in 
 evidence. When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them. 
 (2) Quashing or Modifying the Subpoena. On motion made promptly, the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance 
 would be unreasonable or oppressive. 
 (3) Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About a Victim. Atter a complaint, indictment, or information is tiled, a 
 subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court 
 order. Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that 
 the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object. 
 (d) Service. A marshal, a deputy marshal, or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena. The server must deliver a copy 
 of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day's witness-attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance. The server 
 need not tender the attendance fee or mileage allowance when the United States, a federal officer, or a federal agency has requested the 
 subpoena. 
 (e) Place of Service. 
 (I) In the United States. A subpoena requiring a witness to attend a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United 
 States. 
 (2) In a Foreign Country. If the witness is in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. § 1783 governs the subpoena's service. 
 (g) Contempt. The court (other than a magistrate judge) may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena 
 issued by a federal court in that district. A magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a 
 subpoena issued by that magistrate judge as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 636(e).

 Chris, 
 I have asked our paralegal and IT staff how large a drive we will need, and I hope to have an answer for you by our 1:30 
 call today. 
 As for the most recent production, the hard drive contains the production prepared by our vendor, which includes 
 approximately 1.2 million documents. The CD contains the final portion of the responsive images from Epstein's iPhone. 
 So they were produced separately because they were prepared by different offices: the hard drive was prepared by the 
 vendor, and the CD was prepared by our paralegals. 
 Because we are planning to put all productions onto a single hard drive, as you requested, the files from the CD will be 
 included on that new drive, so Ms. Maxwell will have those files both on a CD and on a hard drive. 
 Best,

 Thanks, 
 We will provide another drive to load the full production. We just have to figure out how big it needs to be. If you have 
 any thoughts on that, please let me know. 
 Also, can you explain the difference between the hard drive and the CD? Did you just need a little more space than what

 Re: United Stases v. Chislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter in connection with the Court's Order of 
 March 24, 2021, regarding the defendant's application for an order authorizing a subpoena 
 pursuant to Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for records from Boies Schiller 
 Flexner LLP ("BSF"). For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that 
 the Court (1) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena 
 to BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule 17(c) returnable 
 in advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule 17(c) subpoenas 
 be produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order. 
 I. Background 
 As the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million 
 pages of discovery pursuant to the Government's various discovery obligations, including Rule 
 16. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government, 
 including material provided pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3500 and Giglio material. 
 EFTA00018236

 Page 2 
 Those obligations, and not Rule 17 subpoenas, provide the avenue through which 
 defendants in criminal cases obtain discovery. As the Supreme Court has explained, "[i]t was not 
 intended by Rule 16 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule 17 to give a right of 
 discovery in the broadest terms." Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951); 
 see also United States v. Purin, 486 F.2d 1363, 1368 (2d Cir. 1973) ("A subpoena duces tecum in 
 a criminal case is not intended as a means of discovery."). Unlike the rules of civil procedure—
 permitting the issuance of subpoenas to seek production of documents or materials which, although 
 themselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize 
 the issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule 17. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F. 
 Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); United States v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. 138, 141 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) 
 (Rule 17(c) cannot be used "to obtain leads as to the existence of additional documentary evidence 
 or to seek information relating to the defendant's case. This type of discovery, permissible under 
 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has not been authorized for criminal trials."). 
 The purpose of Rule 17(c) is to "expedite the trial by providing a time and place before 
 trial for the inspection of specific materials that the parties intend to offer into evidence. See 
 United States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19 Cr. 472 (PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 
 2021) (citing Bowman Data, Co., 341 U.S. at 220 (1951)); see also United States v. Ulbricht, 858 
 F.3d 71, 109 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that the rule "allows parties to subpoena documents and 
 objects to be introduced at criminal trials"), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by United 
 States v. Chambers, 751 F. App'x 44, 46 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order). Accordingly, 
 the Supreme Court has explained that, to require production of materials pursuant to Rule 17(c), 
 the party seeking production must show that: 
 (1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are 
 not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise 
 EFTA00018237
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 195 Filed 04/05/21 Page 3 of 11 
 Page 3 
 of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial 
 without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that 
 the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay 
 the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not 
 intended as a general "fishing expedition." 
 United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974) (footnote omitted); see United States v. 
 Skelos, 988 F.3d 645, 661 (2d Cir. 2021) (affirming a decision to quash subpoenas through 
 application of Nixon); United States v. Pena, No. 15 Cr. 551 (AIN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *1-*2 
 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2016) (applying Nixon, rather than the "more liberal standard" of United States 
 v. Tucker, 249 F.R.D. 58 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), to the propriety of a Rule 17(c) subpoena). 
 The Nixon test is demanding. The defendant must establish that the defense's "application 
 is made in good faith and is not intended as a general `fishing expedition.' Nixon, 418 U.S. at 
 700; United States v. Yian, No. 94 Cr. 719 (DLC), 1995 WL 614563, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 
 1995) (quashing subpoena that "call[s] for the production of the entire investigative file and is 
 accurately described as a fishing expedition"); United States v. Cuthbertson, 630 F.2d 139, 144 
 (3d Cir. 1980) ("[T]est for enforcement is whether the subpoena constitutes a good faith effort to 
 obtain idented evidence rather than a general `fishing expedition' that attempts to use the rule as 
 a discovery device." (emphasis added)). Indeed, because the Rule poses such a risk of abuse and 
 misuse, courts are stringent in holding those seeking to obtain documents to Rule 17(c) to their 
 burden of demonstrating that the documents sought are (1) relevant, (2) admissible, (3) specifically 
 identified, and (4) not otherwise procurable, and it is "insufficient" for a party to show only that 
 the subpoenaed documents "are potentially relevant or may be admissible," United States v. RW 
 Prof! Leasing Servs. Corp., 228 F.R.D. 158, 162 (E.D.N.Y 2005) (emphasis added). "[A] mere 
 hope that the documents, if produced, may contain evidence favorable to the defendant's case will 
 not suffice. Rule 17(c) requires a showing that the materials sought are currently admissible in 
 EFTA00018238

 evidence; it cannot be used as a device to gain understanding or explanation." United States v. 
 Rich, No. 83 Cr. 579 (SWK), 1984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 1984) (internal quotation 
 marks omitted) (emphasis added). Accordingly, subpoenas that call for "any" and "all" records 
 "do not evince specificity" and "read[] like a discovery request, which is not permitted under Rule 
 17(c)." Tagliaferro, 2021 WL 980004 at *3; see Pena, 2016 WL 8735699, at *3. And "[g]enerally 
 the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of 
 trial." Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701 (citations omitted); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(h) ("No party may 
 subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness under this rule."). 
 If a subpoena calls for "personal or confidential information about a victim," the subpoena 
 may be served "only by court order" following "notice to the victim so that the victim can move 
 to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). After a subpoena 
 issues, "[t]he court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or 
 before they are to be offered in evidence." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). "When the items arrive, the 
 court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them." Id. 
 II. The Court Should Direct the Defendant to Provide Notice of Prior and Future 
 Applications Under Rule 17(c) to the Government 
 The Government has legitimate and cognizable interests in Rule 17(c) subpoenas issued by 
 the defense. In particular, courts have routinely found that the Government has standing to move 
 to quash Rule 17(c) subpoenas that target information about anticipated Government witnesses 
 "based on the Government's 'interest in preventing any undue lengthening of the trial, any undue 
 harassment of the witness and his family, and any prejudicial over-emphasis on the witness's 
 credibility."' United States v. Ray, -- F.R.D. --, No. 20 Cr. 110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *7 
 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) (alterations omitted) (quoting United States v. Giampa, No. 92 Cr. 437 
 (PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992)); see United States v. Becgstein, No. 16 
 EFTA00018239

 Page 5 
 Cr. 746 (PKC), 2017 WL 6887596, at *2-*3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2017) ("Preventing the undue 
 harassment of a cooperating witness is a legitimate governmental interest giving rise to standing 
 in this context."); cf. United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 552, 558-60 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) 
 (concluding that the Government failed to establish a legitimate interest where, among other 
 things, none of the subpoenaed entities had been "publicly identified by the Government as trial 
 witnesses, or as particularly vulnerable witnesses"). That is particularly true where the subpoena 
 at issue seeks material that the defendants would be entitled to, if at all, as Giglio or 3500 material 
 given that the Government has a cognizable interest in "controlling the timing of disclosures as 
 to" witnesses who are expected to testify at trial, and for whom the Government has various 
 disclosure obligations. United States v. Cole, No. 19 Cr. 869 (ER), 2021 WL 912425, at *2 
 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2021); see Bergstein, 2017 WL 6887596, at *3. Finally, the Government has 
 standing to challenge subpoenas that call for its own communications. See United States v. Carton, 
 17 Cr. 680 (CM), 2018 WL 5818107, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2018) (quashing a subpoena for 
 communications with the Government).' 
 The only way for the Government to vindicate those interests is with notice so that the 
 Government may, as appropriate, have an opportunity to quash the subpoenas. There is no avenue, 
 after a subpoena is issued and fulfilled, for the Government to protect its interests in the timing of 
 disclosures about victims or the disclosure of the Government's own communications. That is 
 particularly important given that a subpoena recipient may lack sufficient knowledge about the 
 ' The Government also has standing to challenge a Rule 17(c) subpoena at the request of a victim, 
 witness or third-party impacted by the subpoena. See Ray, 2020 WL 6939677, at *7 ("Courts have 
 acknowledged that the Government has standing to challenge Rule 17(c) subpoenas directed to a 
 non-party when the non-party authorizes the Government to assert his or her right by request or by 
 indicating its joinder in a motion to quash." (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).

 case or motivation to move to quash an otherwise improper subpoena.2 Accordingly, the 
 Government respectfully requests notice of all subpoenas with pretrial return dates issued or sought 
 to be issued under Rule 17(c).3
 While, as the Court noted in its Order, Rule 17(c) subpoenas are frequently issued ex parte 
 in this district, the issue is rarely litigated. See, e.g., United States v. States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 
 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (noting, without extended discussion, that subpoena had issued upon ex 
 parte application); United States v. Earl; No. 03 Cr.0364 (NRB), 2004 WL 350725, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
 Feb. 25, 2004) (noting that the defendant may seek subpoenas ex parte). When courts have considered 
 the issue, however, many have directed that the parties should give each other notice of Rule 17(c) 
 subpoenas unless a party can justify proceeding ex parte. See United States v. Skelos, No. 15 Cr. 
 317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018) (explaining that courts have 
 permitted ex parte requests "where a reason existed for doing so," and requiring notice "[t]o further 
 reduce the risk that trial will be delayed, unless a party has a compelling reason for proceeding ex 
 parte with a subpoena request"), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021); United States v. St. Lawrence, 
 16 Cr. 259 (CS), Dkt. No. 66 at 6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2016) (requiring motions for Rule 17(c) 
 subpoenas and permitting ex parte applications "if the movant can articulate a reason why it should 
 be"); United States v. Boyle, No. 08 Cr. 523 (CM), 2009 WL 484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 
 2009) (requiring noticed motions for Rule 17(c) subpoenas to "assur[e] that such subpoenas are 
 not abused or used for impermissible discovery," and permitting ex parte applications "where a 
 2 For example, a financial institution may lack sufficient knowledge about the case or motivation 
 to expend the resources to move to quash what appears to be a routine subpoena that broadly seeks 
 financial records for a Government cooperator or lay witness to be used for impeachment purposes, 
 notwithstanding the fact that such a subpoena may run afoul of the Nixon standard. 
 3 The Government is not seeking notice of subpoenas returnable at trial.

 party can demonstrate" a basis (emphasis omitted)); United States v. Weisman, 01 Cr. 529 (BSJ), 
 2002 WL 1467845, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2002) (similar); see also United States v. Fox, 275 F. 
 Supp. 2d 1006, 1012 & n.7 (D. Neb. 2003) (surveying the caselaw and adopting the "majority 
 view" that Rule 17(c) "does not ordinarily permit the use of ex parte applications by the 
 government or the defense for subpoenas seeking pretrial production of documents unless the sole 
 purpose of seeking the documents is for use at trial," and even then, only if "there is a good trial-
 related reason" and generally requiring production in the presence of the opposing party); 2 Wright 
 & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Procedure § 275 (4'h ed.) ("It has been held, however, that in limited 
 circumstances, both the government and a defendant may make an ex parte application for a pre-
 trial subpoena duces tecum" (emphasis added)). But see Ray, 2020 WL 6939677 at *8 ("Courts 
 in this District have long followed the practice of permitting both the defense and the Government 
 to submit ex parte applications for Rule 17(c) subpoenas."); United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 
 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (permitting ex parte applications because a party must "detail its trial 
 strategy or witness list in order to convince a court that the subpoena satisfies the Nixon 
 standards"). Notice of Rule 17(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse 
 and address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language 
 of Rule 17: while Rule 17(b) expressly provides for an ex parte procedure for indigent defendants 
 seeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an application for the 
 production of documents and objects pursuant to Rule 17(c).4
 4 In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule 17(c) is simply an extension of Rules 17(a) and (b)'s 
 provisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice. See 2020 WL 6939677, at 
 *8 (quoting United States v. Florack, 838 F. Supp. 77, 79 (W.D.N.Y. 1993)). However, Rule 17(c) 
 subpoenas for records are quite unlike subpoenas for trial testimony: they can be made returnable 
 before trial, and Rule 17(c)'s text provides that materials obtained pursuant to such a subpoena 
 may be returnable to the Court, which may in turn "permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect 
 all or part of them," and subjects the subpoenas to motions to quash. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1)-(2) 
 EFTA00018242
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 195 Filed 04/05/21 Page 8 of 11 
 Page 8 
 Moreover, as the information currently available to the Government about the BSF 
 subpoena makes plain, the Government's concerns are well founded. Indeed, the defendant has 
 already sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government's interests 
 by expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications 
 with the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears 
 that the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which 
 plainly runs afoul of the Nixon test. (Letter from BSF to the Court at 2, Dkt. No. 191).5 Insofar 
 as the defendant is attempting to engage in such an improper expedition in this case—or even if 
 the defendant is merely pushing the limits of a Rule 17 subpoena—the Government respectfully 
 submits that it should be afforded the opportunity to bring its concerns to the Court's attention. 
 The Government recognizes that some information, such as portions of a defendant's 
 explanation for why a particular request in a particular subpoena meets the Nixon standard, may 
 reveal critical defense strategy meriting ex parte consideration by the Court. But the Government 
 respectfully submits that interest can be served through specific defense requests tailored to the 
 particular redaction or application at issue, rather than a default whereby the defendant is permitted 
 to proceed entirely ex parte in seeking documents and materials pursuant to Rule 17(c). 
 (emphasis added); see United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ("Rules 17(a) 
 and 17(b), which govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at trial, also do not provide guidance 
 as to the proper procedure for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum."). These procedures are, 
 at a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding azparte or under the rules that govern subpoenas 
 for trial testimony. 
 5 The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court's 
 March 24, 2021 Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2021. To the extent the defendant did 
 file such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the 
 Government is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF 
 subpoena.

 III. Any Records Obtained Pursuant to a Rule 17(c) Subpoena Should Be Marked 
 Confidential Under the Protective Order and Produced to the Opposing Party 
 Additionally, and to the extent the defendant has issued or will issue other subpoenas a 
 pane pursuant to Rule 17(c), the responsive records should be produced to the Government and 
 marked confidential pursuant to the protective order. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). 
 First, materials gathered pursuant to a Rule 17(c) subpoena by either party should be 
 promptly made available to their adversary. As noted above, the text of Rule 17(c) plainly provides 
 that materials obtained pursuant to a subpoena may be returned to the Court which "may permit 
 the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). Nowhere 
 does the Rule provide for one party's ability to use a subpoena to secretively gather material in 
 advance of trial, nor does it include a categorical exception due to concerns about defense or trial 
 strategy. Indeed, because the purpose of Rule 17 is to obtain evidence for use at trial, and not to 
 investigate for evidence or obtain impeachment material, disclosure of the fruits of a Rule 17(c) 
 subpoena fits neatly with Rule 16's reciprocal obligations for disclosure of evidence that the 
 defendant intends to introduce in her case-in-chief. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(A); United States 
 v. St. Lawrence, 16 Cr. 259 (CS), Dkt. No. 66 at 6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2016) ("It seems to the Court 
 that because Rule 17(c) subpoenas are intended to obtain specific materials that the party expects 
 to offer into evidence, Rule 16 would oblige the party to make the materials available to the other 
 side anyway.").6
 By contrast, to the extent the defendant has improperly obtained information through a 
 Rule 17(c) subpoena, the Government should have the opportunity to move to preclude its use at 
 trial. In order to permit such a motion to be made in a timely manner—and so as to avoid the 
 6 To the extent the Government makes use of Rule 17(c) subpoenas, it similarly will promptly 
 produce all material received to the defendant.

 unnecessary delay and disruption that will occur if the Government only learns of the existence of 
 such material during trial—the Government seeks disclosure of any records obtained in response 
 to such a subpoena. At a minimum, the Court should order production of subpoena returns directly 
 to the Court, so it may screen out irrelevant or improper information and determine whether any 
 materials should be made available to the Government as well as the defendant. 
 Second, the Court should direct that any material obtained pursuant to a Rule 17 subpoena 
 be marked confidential and subject to the protective order. As noted above, the BSF subpoena 
 appears to call for a substantial amount of sensitive personal information about victims. For 
 instance, according to the letter from BSF, the subpoena to BSF requests the "original, complete 
 copy" of a victim's diary. (Letter from BSF to the Court at 5, Dkt. No. 191). To the extent the 
 defendant has obtained or will obtain sensitive information about victims or witnesses, it should 
 be treated as "confidential" under the protective order much like other such information in this 
 case.

 single drive containing all productions, we can certainly accommodate that request. Please let me know if you would like 
 us to use one of the drives already at the MDC for this purpose, or if you would like to provide my office with a new drive. 
 My understanding from the MDC is that for security purposes, the laptop will be kept in a locker to which only two 
 lieutenants have access. Those two lieutenants work Monday through Friday 8:30am to 3:30pm, which is when Ms. 
 Maxwell will have access to the laptop. For the remainder of the 13 hours of review time, Ms. Maxwell may review her 
 discovery on the MDC computer. The laptop is being provided to allow Ms. Maxwell to open files that she could not open 
 on the MDC computer. 35 hours per week should be more than sufficient to review any excel files or other file types that 
 cannot be viewed on the MDC computer.

 Good afternoon AUSAM, 
 The FOLA media team advised they downloaded media from file number 31E-MM-108062, including audio and video. However, there seem to be some technical issues, 
 as they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the IA Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a "codec problem," meaning there was probably some sort of 
 user error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever 
 sent us the media. With this one exemption, the rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items. 
 I'm not sure if this is all the media contained in the file though. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or need further assistance.

 Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we 
 were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents 
 that looked like the attached file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, we have them from 
 the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent.

We will send someone to pick up the new production. But as we discussed, if Ms. Maxwell has to rely on the existing hard 
 drives to view the discovery on the new laptop, that is not going to work. 
 For one thing, Ms. Maxwell still has not received the hard drive you produced on November 9, which was supposed to 
 contain replacement copies of the files on the hard drive produced on September 3 (which was broken in MDC) and the 
 files in the October 2 production (see attached email). We cannot rely on a drive that has not been made available to Ms. 
 Maxwell. 
 Also, when we spoke about the laptop, my understanding was that if you could not load the files directly onto the laptop, 
 you would create a new hard drive that contained the entire discovery production and that you would verify that the files 
 on that hard drive were readable on the new laptop. That way, we would not have to rely on a patchwork of prior hard 
 drives which had a lot of problems. 
 To be clear, I don't think the laptop solution you have proposed will solve the problems that Ms. Maxwell has been 
 experiencing and is not consistent with what we discussed. If there is no way to load the full discovery on the laptop 
 itself, then please advise if you are able to create a new hard drive that contains the complete production (without the 
 highly confidential materials) that can be made available to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. 
 Also, I have been informed by Ms. Maxwell, that the MDC told her today that she will only be able to use the laptop to 
 review discovery from 8:30am-3:30pm on weekdays. That is only seven hours a day, as opposed to the 13 hours a day 
 (plus weekends) that the BOP had agreed to before. There is no reason for this restriction. It is also not acceptable. In 
 this latest production alone, there are over 2 million pages to review. Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly review that much 
 material by trial if her review is restricted in this way. Please confirm that she will be able to have the full 13 hours per 
 day (plus weekends) to review the discovery, as previously agreed. 
 Thanks, 
 Chris

 Counsel, 
 A drive and a CD containing a new discovery production in the above-referenced case are now available for pickup at One 
 St. Andrew's Plaza. Attached please find the accompanying discovery letter. 
 This morning, I hand delivered a copy of this production and a laptop to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell. My understanding 
 from the MDC is that Ms. Maxwell will be permitted to use this laptop and a power cord to review her discovery drives. 
 Our IT staff, paralegal staff, and I have all confirmed that this laptop is able to open every file type contained in the 
 discovery productions to date. The laptop does not have sufficient storage space to save the productions on the laptop 
 itself, but we have saved all discovery cover letters to date on the desktop for ease of access. Ms. Maxwell will need to 
 use the hard drives with the laptop to review her discovery.

 Hi =, 
 Thanks for your help with this. We spoke with at BOP legal this morning, and she highlighted three 
 specific requirements for the laptop: 
 • It must be disabled for all communications, including wifi/bluetooth 
 • All games and entertainment programs must be disabled/uninstalled 
 • All audio and video recording capabilities must be disabled 
 is conferring with the Warden in the next few days to determine whether our laptop request will be approved. If 
 the request is approved, we are aiming to deliver the laptop to MDC on November 16th, if at all possible. We would need 
 time to load the laptop with files before it goes to MDC.

 I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
 would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
 review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
 did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
 huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
 Thanks so much—

 Following up on the below, given the development of the virus pandemic over the past week, any foreign travel for us is 
 completely shut down. We certainly will plan to come to the U.K. whenever we are permitted, but in the interim this 
 makes it even more valuable to get even a summary of what your client would expect to convey to us. Would it be 
 possible to set up a call for later this week or sometime next week? And profound apologies for the inconvenience in 
 changing plans, we certainly don't want to cause additional stress or anxiety to your client, the circumstances are just 
 completely beyond our control. 
 thank you,

 Just to clarify, would it be possible for you to provide us even a very general or high-level summary of what she has told 
 you? We ordinarily don't go into interviews completely blind when witnesses have counsel — and the Weinstein 
 investigation had a great number of problems that we have been able to avoid. And separately, we'll of course keep you 
 updated on our approval process as well. 
 thanks again,

 Thanks 
 I am afraid that an attorney proffer will not be possible. I have been working with the DA in New York on the Weinstein 
 case and have simply offered up my clients to questions which has worked well. 
 I am of course happy to speak over the phone but it seems to me that you are better off getting the information first hand. 
 If you wish it may be sensible for you to initially have a call with my client? 
 My client has made a complaint to the Met police regarding a sexual assault by Jeffrey Epstein whilst in London and in 
 the employment of G Maxwell. Apart from the complaint itself, no further information has been provided to the police. 
 I appreciate the issue re coronavirus of course. 
 Kind regards, 
 Jill

 Hope you're doing well. As our team reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up 
 with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in 
 the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached 
 file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, 
 we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of 
 materials you sent.

 we last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the

 Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
 York (Loretta A. Preska,Judge). 
 UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, 
 ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the District Court be and hereby is 
 AFFIRMED. 
 Defendant -Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from a July 23, 2020 order unsealing certain 
 litigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell's April 2016 deposition transcript. She argues 
 that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of the deposition materials. 
 Specifically, she argues that there is a lower presumption of access to the deposition materials at 
 issue in this case than to the summary judgment materials we ordered unsealed in Brown v. Atwavehc 
 929 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 2019), and that her interests outweigh the public's interests. We assume the 
 parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on 
 appeal) 
 When reviewing a district court's decision to seal a filing or maintain such a seal, "we 
 examine the court's factual findings for clear error, its legal determinations de novo, and its ultimate 
 decision to seal or unseal for abuse of discretion." Brown, 929 F.3d at 47 (citing Bernstein v. Bernstein 
 Litowitt Berger dr Grossman LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2016)). A district court abuses its 
 discretion if it "(1) bases its decision on an error of law or uses the wrong legal standard; (2) bases its 
 decision on a dearly erroneous factual finding; or (3) reaches a conclusion that, though not 
 necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding, cannot be located 
 within the range of permissible decisions." Klipscb Grp. Inc. v. Epro E-Commerce Ltd, 880 F.3d 620, 
 627 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
 Although Michael Cemovich, DBA Cemovich Media, did not enter an appearance in this 
 appeal, letters of his dated July 31, 2020 and September 9, 2020 are before the Court.

 EFTA00018290
Case 20-2413. Document 140-1, 10/19/2020, 2955244, Page3 of 3 
 We cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of 
 the deposition materials. While "the presumption of public access in filings submitted in connection 
 with discovery disputes or motions in Iimine is generally somewhat lower than the presumption 
 applied to material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions such as motions for 
 dismissal or summary judgment," the District Court correctly held that the deposition materials are 
 judicial documents to which the presumption of public access attaches, and did not abuse its 
 discretion in rejecting Maxwell's meritless arguments that her interests superseded the presumption 
 of access. Brown, 929 F.3d at 50. The District Court's order articulated and applied the correct legal 
 framework in its individualized review of the materials to be unsealed. 
 CONCLUSION 
 We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal 
 and find them to be without merit We DENY the motion to consolidate this appeal with the 
 pending appeal in United States a Maxwell, No. 20-3061-cr. For the foregoing reasons, we also 
 AFFIRM the July 23, 2020 order of the District Court. 
 In the interest of judicial economy, any further appeal in this civil case shall be referred to 
 this panel. 
 The mandate shall issue forthwith.

 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
 Plaintiff, 
 -against-
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 Defendant. 
 No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
 MEMORANDUM & ORDER 
 LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge: 
 The Court has reviewed Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's letter 
 requesting reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020, decision 
 to unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's 
 depositions, and (2) court submissions excerpting from, quoting 
 from, or summarizing the contents of the transcripts. (See dkt. 
 no. 1078.) 
 Ms. Maxwell's eleventh-hour request for reconsideration is 
 denied. As Ms. Maxwell acknowledges in her letter, reconsideration 
 is an "extraordinary remedy." In re Beacon Assocs. Litig., 818 F. 
 Supp. 2d 697, 701 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting In re Health Mgmt. Sys. 
 Inc. Sec. Litig., 113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). Such 
 motions "are properly granted only if there is a showing of: (1) 
 an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of 
 new evidence; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent 
 manifest injustice." Drapkin v. Mafco Consol. Grp., Inc., 818 F. 
 Supp. 2d 678, 696 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). "A motion for reconsideration 
 1 
 EFTA00018294
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 2 of 4 
 may not be used to advance new facts, issues or arguments not 
 previously presented to the Court, nor may it be used as a vehicle 
 for relitigating issues already decided by the Court." Bennett v. 
 Watson Wyatt & Co., 156 F. Supp.2d 270, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). 
 Here, Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration hinges on her 
 assertion that new developments, i.e., her indictment and arrest, 
 provide compelling reasons for keeping the deposition transcripts 
 sealed. (See dkt. no. 1078 at 5.) But, despite Ms. Maxwell's 
 contention that she could not address the effect of those events 
 in her objections because they occurred after the close of 
 briefing, (id.), 1 this is plowed ground. Indeed, in her original 
 objection to unsealing, Ms. Maxwell argued that the specter of 
 ongoing criminal investigations into unknown individuals 
 associated with Jeffrey Epstein--a group that, of course, includes 
 Ms. Maxwell--loomed large over the Court-ordered unsealing 
 2 The Court notes as a practical matter that Ms. Maxwell was 
 arrested on July 2, 2020--that is, three weeks prior to the Court's 
 July 23 decision to unseal the materials at issue. To the extent 
 that they relate to the to the Court's balancing of interests in 
 the unsealing process, the issues that Ms. Maxwell raises in her 
 request were surely plain the day that Ms. Maxwell was apprehended. 
 Ms. Maxwell, however, did not seek to supplement her objections to 
 unsealing despite ample time to do so. In fact, the Court notified 
 the parties on July 21, 2020, that it would announce the unsealing 
 decision with respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, together with 
 other documents, on July 23. (See dkt. no. 1076.) Even then, Ms. 
 Maxwell made no request for delay or to supplement her papers. 
 Ms. Maxwell did not raise her "vastly different position," 
 (Transcript of July 23 Ruling at 16:2-3), until moments after the 
 Court had made its decision to unseal the relevant documents.

 • DK is one of the Dechert attorneys conducting the Apollo internal investigation regarding Leon Black's 
 relationship with Epstein. Mandate is to understand what the relationship was between the two men and why 
 Black was paying Epstein money. Looks to be Epstein was being paid for some reason other than the services he 
 was providing. 
 • DK reaching out to ask SDNY if there is anything available publicly that would shed any light on either Black's 
 relationship with Epstein and/or Epstein's source of expertise to charge money. DK made clear he is not asking for 
 SDNY to provide anything that is not public or would not be ordinarily accessible by third parties. 
 • • indicated would check with team and get back to DK.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 3 of 4 
 process. (See dkt. no. 1057 at 5.) This argument, specifically 
 Ms. Maxwell's concern that unsealing would "inappropriately 
 influence potential witnesses or alleged victims," (id.), and her 
 reference to "publicly reported statements by Plaintiff, 
 Plaintiff's counsel, the United States Attorney for the Southern 
 District of New York, and the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin 
 Islands" about those investigations, (id.), carried with it the 
 clear implication that Ms. Maxwell could find herself subject to 
 investigation and, eventually, indictment. The Court understood 
 that implication as applying to Ms. Maxwell and thus has already 
 considered any role that criminal charges against Ms. Maxwell might 
 play in rebutting the presumption of public access to the sealed 
 materials. Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the 
 Court's July 23 ruling is accordingly denied. 
 Given the Court's denial of Ms. Maxwell's request for 
 reconsideration, the Court will stay the unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's 
 and Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed or redacted order 
 or paper that quotes from or discloses information from those 
 deposition transcripts for two business days, i.e., through 
 Friday, July 31, 2020, so that Ms. Maxwell may seek relief from 
 the Court of Appeals. Any sealed materials that do not quote from 
 or disclose information from those deposition transcripts shall be 
 unsealed on July 30, 2020, in the manner described by the Court's 
 Order dated July 28, 2020. (See dkt. no. 1077.) Ms. Maxwell's and

 Hi 
 In response to the letter we filed yesterday, today Maxwell's counsel filed her own letter demanding that Judge Nathan 
 order the Warden of the MDC to appear for a court proceeding to address the defense's complaints about Maxwell's 
 conditions of confinement. Judge Nathan endorsed that letter with an order that the parties confer and provide another 
 update letter by Tuesday 12/1. Attached is the defense letter with Judge Nathan's endorsement. 
 Would you be available tomorrow (11/25) afternoon to discuss, please? Apologies for the late request, but we are hoping 
 to address this before the Thanksgiving holiday.

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 USDC SDNY 
 DOCUMENT 
 ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
 DOCO: 
 DATE FILED:  11/24/20 
 As counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, I write in response to the government's letter, dated 
 November 23, 2020 (see Dkt 74), reporting Ms. Maxwell's conditions of detention and 
 confirming that she is currently in quarantine due to contact with a staff member, assigned to her 
 isolation pod, who tested positive for COVID-19. 
 The government recites a variety of allowances given Ms. Maxwell, including being 
 permitted out of her cell three times a week during quarantine for a maximum of 30 minutes, the 
 total time allotted for showering, making personal calls, and using the CorrLinks email system to 
 communicate with family and counsel. However, the letter presents an incomplete picture of 
 Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement. 
 The government fails to mention a variety of issues brought to the attention of the MDC, 
 including but not limited to the fact: that all email correspondence between Ms. Maxwell and 
 counsel was deleted in advance of the 180-day period, when deletion is expected to occur; that 
 after being administered two nasal swab tests, under threat of 21-day quarantine if she declined 
 to be tested, Ms. Maxwell was ordered to remove her COVID-protection mask for an in-mouth 
 inspection, further risking exposure to the virus; that Ms. Maxwell was initially quarantined 
 without soap or a toothbrush; that medical and psychology staff, who checked on Ms. Maxwell 
 daily pre-quarantine, have ceased doing so daily since quarantine and have neither informed her 
 of results of the COVID tests nor provided information in response to her inquiry regarding what 
 she should do if she becomes symptomatic. 
 The letter omits the fact that while staff are not supposed to enter Ms. Maxwell's 
 isolation cell during quarantine, an unidentified man entered to take photographs and a guard 
 entered to search. Further, while counsel assumed that an in-person legal visit scheduled for 
 Saturday, November 21, would be canceled as a result of Ms. Maxwell's quarantine status, no 
 notification was provided; and a request for a substituted legal call was not accommodated.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 76 Filed 11/24/20 Page 2 of 2 
 LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM 
 The government highlights what Ms. Maxwell is permitted but not what she is denied: 
 equal treatment accorded other inmates in general population. Ms. Maxwell has spent the 
 entirely of her pretrial detention in de facto solitary confinement under the most restrictive 
 conditions where she is excessively and invasively searched and is monitored 24 hours per day. 
 In addition to camera surveillance in her cell, a supplemental camera follows her movement 
 when she is permitted to leave her isolation cell and is focused on Ms. Maxwell and counsel 
 during in-person legal visits. And despite non-stop in-cell camera surveillance, Ms. Maxwell's 
 sleep is disrupted every 15-minutes when she is awakened by a flashlight to ascertain whether 
 she is breathing. 
 Ms. Maxwell is a non-violent, exemplary pretrial detainee with no criminal history, no 
 history of violence, no history of mental health issues or suicidal ideation. She is overmanaged 
 under conditions more restrictive than inmates housed in 10South, the most restrictive unit in the 
 MCC; or individuals convicted of terrorism and capital murder and incarcerated at FCI Florence 
 ADMAX, the most restrictive facility operated by the BOP. The MDC concedes that it is unable 
 to place her in general population for her safety and the security of the institution but fails to 
 explain why she is deprived of all other opportunities provided to general population inmates. 
 Stating that Ms. Maxwell "continues to have more time to review her discovery than any 
 other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine" gives the unfair impression that she is being 
 given a perquisite. However, given the voluminous discovery in this case, the most recent 
 production alone being 1.2 million documents, the time accorded Ms. Maxwell remains 
 inadequate for her to review and prepare the defense of her life. 
 Due to the failure of MDC's Warden and Legal Department to respond to recurring 
 problems and complaints, counsel have reached out to the government. While we appreciate any 
 assistance provided by government counsel, it has done little to redress the many concerns 
 regarding the disparate treatment of Ms. Maxwell. 
 Rather than receive second-hand information from counsel, the defense requests that the 
 Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to report directly to the Court and counsel on Ms. 
 Maxwell's conditions of detention. 
 Your consideration is greatly appreciated. 
 Very truly yours,

 OF JUDGE NATHAN'S INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES IN CRIMINAL CASES) 
 The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 United States District Court 
 Southern District of New York 
 40 Foley Square 
 New York, New York 10007 
 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 800 Third Avenue 
 New Yolk, NY 10022 
 +1 212 957 7600 phone 
 whwtcohensresser cool 
 On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for 
 Release on Bail (the "Motion") and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all 
 counsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the 
 Motion. For the reasons explained below, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 
 49.1(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting 
 materials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an 
 in camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other 
 confidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the 
 government, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting 
 that sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those 
 that the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case. 
 In the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell's request for bail and granted the 
 government's motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial 
 information that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive 
 bail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly, 
 Ms. Maxwell now seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0. 
 Ms. Maxwell's renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if 
 made public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including: 
 • Letters from Ms. Maxwell's family members and close friends, who have agreed to 
 serve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell's renewed bail application. The letters 
 contain personal details that, if made public, would invite identification and

 harassment of the sureties and other third parties, including minor children. They are 
 legitimately afraid that if their identities become public, they will be subjected to the 
 same relentless media scrutiny and threats that Ms. Maxwell has experienced for 
 more than a year, like the following sample of social media posts: 
 "they need to get this bitch n string her up by her neck . . Peking monster . . . 
 #GhislaineMaxwell." 
 "I hope someone finds her and kills her. That would be justice. Obviously her 
 lawyers know's where she is, someone should stick them up to batteries untill we 
 fi nd out where she is." 
 "SHE'S HERE in Massachusetts ?! The bitch #GhislaineMaxwell who 
 ftSexTrafficked young girls for #Epstein ?!?! Why the hell isn't she being brought in 
 for questioning @ManchesterMAPD ?! WE DO NOT WANT HER HERE! 
 #SleezyLeach She is CLOSE ENOUGH to me, I could grab her myself!" 
 • A financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins Limited, that provides 
 a summary of Ms. Maxwell's financial condition from 2015-2020 and discloses all of 
 her assets, all assets held in trust, and assets held by other family members. 
 • A discussion and analysis of certain materials produced by the government in 
 discovery marked "Confidential" and their impact on the government's case against 
 Ms. Maxwell, which must be filed under seal pursuant to the terms of the Protective 
 Order in this case (Dkt. 36). 
 Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1(d) provides that "a court may order that a filing be made under seal 
 without redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing 
 to file a redacted version for the public record." While the Second Circuit has recognized a 
 presumption of access under both common law and the First Amendment, it is appropriate to 
 permit the filing of documents under seal if "countervailing factors" in the common law 
 framework or "higher values" in the First Amendment framework so demand. Lugosch v. 
 Pyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256 
 F. Supp. 3d 355, 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits 
 and finding that privacy interests "outweigh any public interest in disclosure, whether derived 
 from the First Amendment or the common-law right of access"). 
 Moreover, a lower presumption of public access applies to documents submitted in 
 connection with powers that are "ancillary to the court's core role in adjudicating a case" than to 
 "material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions." Brown v. Maxwell, 929 
 F.3d 41, 49-50 (2d Cir. 2019) (applying lower presumption to documents submitted in 
 connection with discovery and evidentiary motions than to summary judgment filings). Thus, a 
 lower presumption of public access attaches the parties' pretrial bail submissions than to exhibits 
 introduced at trial or in connection with a motion to dismiss.

 Here, that lower presumption is far outweighed by the significant privacy interests 
 implicated by the materials at issue. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 
 1995) ("[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court's 
 balancing equation"). If Ms. Maxwell's sureties are publicly identified, they will be harassed 
 simply for their association with and support of her. Indeed, some of Ms. Maxwell's closest 
 friends and famil have alread suffered ificant cons -i uences. For example, 
 The sureties are legitimately scared that they and their children will suffer the same 
 consequences, and may not be able to come forward at all, if the Court does not allow their 
 letters and their identities to be sealed. See id. at 1051 ("[C]ourts have the power to insure that 
 their records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]"). These 
 individuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell's accusers, no longer minors, who 
 have been permitted to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities. 
 The presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's privacy interest 
 in details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that 
 would be implicated if Ms. Maxwell's assets were publicly disclosed. See id. (personal financial 
 records traditionally considered private, not public). 
 Similar privacy interests led the court to permit the redaction of bail submission materials 
 in United States v. Nejad ("Sadr"), Case 1:18-cr-00224-AJN (S.D.N.Y.). Like this case, Sadr 
 involved a defendant with meaningful assets and a bail package with numerous co-signers. At 
 the initial bail hearing, Judge Carter ordered both defense counsel and the government to redact 
 attachments to their submissions because they contained "sensitive private information with 
 respect to a whole series of individuals." (Id., Dkt. 21 at 25.) The privacy interests at stake here 
 are significantly higher, given the documented threats against Ms. Maxwell and harassment of 
 her family and friends. 
 For the reasons set forth above, we believe that portions of the Motion, and certain 
 materials submitted in support thereof and in opposition thereto, should be filed under seal. We 
 respectfully request an in camera conference to address these issues and other confidentiality 
 concerns related to the Motion. We have consulted with the government, which consents to the 
 redaction and sealed filing of (1) the names and identifying information of any proposed 
 cosigners, (2) any discovery materials designated confidential under the Protective Order in this 
 case, and (3) any information derived from confidential discovery materials in this case. The 
 government does not consent to the in camera conference.

 That's great, thank you for letting us know, and we'll check on that right away and get back to you as soon as possible. 
 The only wrinkle, which unfortunately is completely beyond our control, is that there is now some talk of government 
 international travel being prevented due to the coronavirus situation, but we'll talk to the relevant people here 
 immediately. 
 One thing that would be extremely helpful for us in the near-term, including in terms of getting approvals here — and we 
 talked about this on the phone as well — would be to get an attorney proffer about your understanding of generally what 
 information you expect your client will convey on the subjects we've spoken about? We completely understand that it's 
 best to have her tell her story directly to us, but in terms of our preparation it's often very useful for both us and the 
 witness for us to have had a conversation with counsel in the first instance. Would it be possible to set up a call to have 
 that discussion? We could do as soon as tomorrow or Friday, or also next week. 
 Thanks very much,

 United States District Judge 
 United States Courthouse

 New York, NY 10007 
 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
 S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell renew our request that the Court release the names of 
 potential jurors, for attorneys' eyes only, as soon as the written questionnaires are distributed. 
 Based on the Court's statement during the October 21 teleconference, it was counsel's 
 understanding that juror names would be provided to counsel on the Juror Sheet to be inserted in 
 the questionnaire. In responding to the Court's order regarding approval of the video to be played 
 to prospective jurors, the government importuned the Court to deny counsel the opportunity to 
 properly vet jurors at this critical state of the proceeding. Not knowing the names of the 
 potential jurors will prevent the parties from conducting necessary background research on the 
 jurors in advance of voir dire so that they may evaluate potential challenges and strikes. Due to 
 the large number of potential jurors (600), waiting until voir dire to release the names of the 
 jurors will make it virtually impossible for the parties to conduct any meaningful research to 
 uncover issues that may require follow-up questions, lead to additional cause challenges, or 
 enable the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges in an informed manner. 
 Recently, in Sines, et at v. Kessler, et at, 17-CV-72 (KNM) (W.D. Va.), the civil case 
 brought against the organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the United 
 EFTA00018373
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 407 Filed 11/03/21 Page 2 of 7 
 LAW OFFICES OF OOOBI C.STERNHEIM 
 States District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered a semi-anonymous jury (jurors 
 were publicly referred to by number only) and released the names of all potential jurors to 
 counsel, plus all pro se defendants (including Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell), who 
 are allegedly prominent white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the leaders of hate groups that 
 planned, promoted, and executed the violent acts in Charlottesville. (See Exhibit A, annexed.) 
 The defendants in Sines included factions of the Ku Klux Klan. The concerns for juror privacy in 
 Sines dwarf any conceivable concerns in this case and Sines is also the subject of extensive 
 ongoing publicity. We submit that withholding the names of 600 jurors until the day of jury 
 selection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury and is a 
 procedure that would violate due process in this particular case.' 
 "An impartial jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of 
 interest and bias." United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, 111 (2d Cir. 2015). In Parse, a case 
 before Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and 
 three of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86. 
 After trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground 
 that one of the jurors, Juror No. I (Catherine M. Conrad), "had lied and withheld material 
 information during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley appointed Bobbi 
 C. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror 
 was examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867 
 F.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2012) found it "undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire 
 and concealed important information about her background" (id. at 451), her level of education, 
 place of residence, criminal history, and other matters. Parse, 789 F.33 at 87-90. 
 ' We are unaware of any other recent high-profile case in which a written juror questionnaire was 
 used and the Court withheld the names of the jurors from counsel following the completion of 
 the questionnaires.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 407 Filed 11/03/21 Page 3 of 7 
 LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.STERNHEIM 
 Judge Pauley granted a motion for a new trial as to Parse's three co-defendants but held 
 that Parse had waived his right to an impartial jury because his attorneys had sat on background 
 research collected before and during trial that suggested Conrad's voir dire answers were false. 
 Id. at 101. On appeal, the Second Circuit "had no difficulty with the ruling of the district court in 
 the present case that the jury empaneled to hear the case against these defendants was not an 
 impartial jury." Id. at III. Moreover, the Second Circuit reversed Judge Pauley's ruling that 
 Parse had waived his right to an impartial jury, and vacated Parse's conviction. Id. at 118. 
 The result in Parse was that a three-month trial, with 41 witnesses and some 1,300 
 exhibits, was undone by the falsehoods of one juror during voir dire—falsehoods that could have 
 been uncovered by thorough background research and prompt action by the parties. Numerous 
 bar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct intemet research on 
 potential jurors. Some bar associations have opined that professional standards of competence 
 and diligence may require such research. For example, just weeks after Judge Pauley conducted 
 a post-conviction evidentiary hearing in Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the 
 following in Formal Opinion 2012-2: 
 Just as the intemet and social media appear to facilitate juror misconduct, the same 
 tools have expanded an attorney's ability to conduct research on potential and sifting 
 jurors, and clients now often expect that attorneys will conduct such research. Indeed, 
 standards of competence and diligence may require doing everything reasonably 
 possible to learn about the jurors who will sit in judgment on a case. 
 Similarly, in 2014, the American Bar Association recognized the "strong public interest 
 in identifying jurors who might be tainted by improper bias or prejudice," and therefore opined 
 that it was proper for counsel to research "a juror's or potential juror's Internet presence, which 
 may include postings by the juror or potential juror in advance of and during a trial. . . ." See 
 Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 466 at 1-2, Am. Bar

 Assn. (2014); see also New York State Bar Association, Dec. 8, 2015 Report of the Social Media 
 Committee of the Commercial and Federal Litigation Section, at 15 ("[I]t is not only permissible 
 for trial counsel to conduct Internet research on prospective jurors, but [] it may even be 
 expected."). 
 Other courts have acknowledged that using the intemet to conduct background research 
 on prospective jurors is a "rudimentary practice" during jury selection. United States v. Stone, 
 No. 19-0018 (ABJ), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67359, at *93 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2020); see also 
 Carino v. Muenzen, No. A-5491-0811, 2010 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2154, at *27 (Super. Ct. 
 App. Div. Aug. 30, 2010) (trial judge erred in preventing counsel from using the intemet during 
 jury selection). It is so routine that a party who fails to uncover disqualifying information about 
 a potential juror, despite a reasonable opportunity to do so, risks waiving the right to use that 
 information in post-conviction proceedings. Stone at *90 (denying motion to vacate conviction 
 and for a new trial because, inter alia, "the defense could have discovered the [foreperson's 
 social media] posts as early as September 12, 2019, the day counsel received access to the 
 completed juror questionnaires, including the foreperson's, which had her name printed legibly 
 on the signature page."). 
 Having additional time to conduct background research on each of the venirepersons is 
 the best way to ensure a fair and impartial jury. Balancing the need to protect juror privacy 
 against Ms. Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury weighs in favor of releasing the names of 
 potential jurors to counsel upon the completion of their written questionnaires, not at voir dire.

 Upon this Court's own motion, upon notice that Plaintiffs' counsel may seek to designate 
 certain non-lawyers within their list of six (6) persons to be provided electronic access to the jury 
 questionnaires, and otherwise finding good cause shown, the Court hereby AMENDS Pretrial

 'Uncontrollable' Jeffrey Epstein: 5 Takeaways 
 From Judge's Bail Decision 
 By Ben Weiser 
 Mr. Epstein was willing to pay almost anything to stay out of jail. But the judge suggested he 
 could not curb his sexual fixation with minors. 
 July 19, 2019 
 [What you need to know to start the day: Get New 
 York Today in your Mbar" 
 A federal judge on Thursday denied Jeffrey 
 Epstein's request for bail pending his trial on sex-
 trafficking charges in Manhattan. As a result, Mr. 
 Epstein, 66, a wealthy financier who owns a private 
 jet, luxury homes around the world and a private 
 island in the Caribbean, will have to spend months 
 in a Manhattan jail that typically holds accused 
 mobsters, drug dealers and terrorists. 
 The judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District 
 Court, agreed with prosecutors that Mr. Epstein was 
 not only a flight risk, but posed a threat to others —
 particularly teenage girls - if released. 
 The judge's strong rebuke of Mr. Epstein's conduct 
 and request to be allowed house arrest stood in 
 sharp contrast to how the authorities in Florida had 
 treated the financier in 2007. 
 f 
 EFTA00018384
That year, he reached a widely criticized deal that 
 let him avoid federal prosecution on charges he 
 sexually abused and trafficked minors. Instead, he 
 pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor 
 for prostitution and ended up serving 13 months in 
 jail. He was allowed to leave the facility six a days 
 a week,  ostensibly to work. 
 Here are five takeaways from Judge Berman's 
 opinion. 
 Mr. Epstein was willing to pay almost any price 
 to stay out of jail 
 Unlike so many people charged in state and federal 
 courts, affording bail was not a problem for Mr. 
 Epstein. He had offered to post a gargantuan bond, 
 secured by his $56 million mansion on East 71st 
 Street in Manhattan and his  private jet. 
 "I am authorized to say to the court," one of Mr. 
 Epstein's lawyers told Judge Berman, "that 
 whatever bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign —
 whether it's $100 million or an amount close to the 
 amount of the assets that we have provided — Mr. 
 Epstein is prepared to sign it." 
 Mr. Epstein provided the court with a one-page 
 summary of his assets that placed their value as of 
 June 30 at $559 million. 
 His lawyers said he would even pay for 24-hour 
 private security to assure that he did not flee. The 
 government argued he was seeking special 
 treatment, a "gilded cage," as one prosecutor put it 
 in court.

The judge was concerned that if released, Mr. 
 Epstein would again abuse teenage girls 
 Judge Berman's decision portrayed Mr. Epstein as 
 sex offender who could not be trusted to curb his 
 sexual fixation with teenagers. He pointed to the 
 nature of Mr. Epstein's alleged crimes and his 
 propensity to commit them. 
 "The crimes Mr. Epstein has been charged with are 
 among the most heinous in the law principally, in 
 the court's view, because they involve minor girls," 
 the judge wrote. 
 A federal indictment charged that between 2002 and 
 2005, Mr. Epstein and his employees paid dozens of 
 underage girls — at least one as young as 14 years 
 old — to give him massages while nude or topless 
 at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, 
 Fla. 
 During the massages, he engaged in various sex 
 acts with them, the indictment said. He also used 
 some of the teenagers to recruit other girls to abuse, 
 paying the "victim-recruiters" hundreds of dollars 
 for each girl they brought to him, the indictment 
 said. 
 "Mr. Epstein's alleged excessive attraction to sexual 
 conduct with or in the presence of minor girls —
 which is said to include his soliciting and receiving 
 massages from young girls and young women 
 perhaps as many as four times a day — appears 
 likely to be uncontrollable," Judge Berman wrote. 
 "It seems fair to say that Mr. Epstein's future 
 behavior will be consistent with past behavior," the 
 judge added. 
 EFTA00018386
His immense wealth, private planes, 
 international travel and liquid cash made Mr. 
 Epstein a flight risk 
 Given Mr. Epstein's wealth, the risk of flight was 
 "exceptionally high," the office of Geoffrey S. 
 Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, 
 told the judge in court papers. 
 Besides his New York mansion, Mr. Epstein's asset 
 summary listed multi-million-dollar properties in 
 New Mexico; Palm Beach; Paris and the Caribbean. 
 Prosecutors have said Mr. Epstein's primary 
 residence is a private island in the United States 
 Virgin Islands. 
 Mr. Epstein's assets also included $56 million in 
 cash and more than $300 million in securities and 
 other financial instruments. Prosecutors also said 
 his sex registration documentation (stemming from 
 his 2008 guilty plea in Florida) listed no fewer than 
 15 motor vehicles, including seven Chevrolet 
 Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a 
 Mercedes-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade and a 
 Hummer. 
 Then there was a safe that the authorities said they 
 searched in Mr. Epstein's mansion in Manhattan, in 
 which they found more than $70,000 in cash, 48 
 loose diamonds ranging in size from approximately 
 one to 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring. 
 The judge concluded that Mr. Epstein was "a 
 serious risk of flight" and "no conditions can be set 
 that will reasonably assure his appearance at trial." 
 The contents of Mr. Epstein's safe gave the judge 
 pause 
 EFTA00018387
Inside that safe the authorities also found an 
 Austrian  passport bearing Mr. Epstein's photograph 
 but another person's name, the judge noted. The 
 judge's opinion made it clear that prosecutors and 
 Mr. Epstein's lawyers disagreed sharply over the 
 passport's significance. 
 Prosecutors said the passport showed Mr. Epstein 
 knew how to obtain false travel documents or 
 assume other identities. 
 Defense lawyers told the judge that Mr. Epstein, 
 whom they described as "an affluent member of the 
 Jewish faith,"acquired the passport in the 1980s 
 "when hijackings were prevalent," in connection 
 with Middle East travel. The passport expired 32 
 years ago, the defense wrote, and "was for personal 
 protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, 
 only to be presented to potential kidnappers, 
 hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes 
 occur." 
 In the back and forth, prosecutors noted that the 
 passport included numerous stamps showing it was 
 used to enter France, Spain, Britain and Saudi 
 Arabia in the 1980s. The defense said Mr. Epstein 
 was given the passport by a friend, the trips were 
 not his and he had never used it. 
 The passport was not the only unusual item found 
 inside Mr. Epstein's mansion. The authorities said 
 they found hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
 sexually suggestive photographs of fully or partially 
 nude females, including photos that appeared to be 
 of underage girls. Some of the photos were 
 discovered in the locked safe. 
 The judge was concerned Mr. Epstein might try 
 to intimidate or buy off witnesses 
 EFTA00018388
Judge Berman also made it clear he thought Mr. 
 Epstein might seek to silence witnesses against him 
 if he were granted pretrial release. "Mr. Epstein's 
 dangerousness is considerable and includes sex 
 crimes with minor girls and tampering with 
 potential witnesses," the judge wrote. 
 The judge highlighted the government's argument 
 that Mr. Epstein had tried to influence possible 
 witnesses against him when he wired $350,000 late 
 last year to two  people close to him, shortly after 
 the Miami Herald started publishing an exposé 
 about him. The Herald's series quoted his accusers, 
 described how he had sexually abused teens for 
 years, and laid out the lenient plea agreement he 
 had negotiated with the United States attorney in 
 Miami. 
 The judge also cited evidence from prosecutors that 
 Mr. Epstein or his representatives had harassed or 
 intimidated witnesses in civil suits. 
 For instance, he quoted a Palm Beach police report 
 in 2006 about a threat made to one of Mr. Epstein's 
 accusers. The report said the accuser had claimed 
 that one of Mr. Epstein's associates had told her that 
 those who helped Mr. Epstein "will be 
 compensated" and those who hurt him "will be 
 dealt with." In another case, a parent of one of Mr. 
 Epstein's alleged victims had reported that Mr. 
 Epstein's private investigator had driven the 
 parent's car off the road. 
 "A court may order detention if there is a serious 
 risk that the defendant will attempt to threaten, 
 injure or intimidate a prospective witness or juror," 
 the judge noted.

 Attorney General Bill Barr 
 will not recuse himself from 
 Jeffrey Epstein child sex 
 prosecution 
 PUBLISHED 10 MIN AGO 
 Attorney General William Barr will not recuse himself from involvement in the new federal criminal 
 prosecution of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, an official said Tuesday. 
 But Barr will recuse himself from an internal Justice Department probe of current Labor Secretary's 
 Alex Acosta involvement in approving a controversial no-prosecution deal with the wealthy 
 financier a decade ago, an official said. 
 Barr's decision to have oversight over the Epstein prosecution came on the heels of reports that he 
 had recused himself from the case, which is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
 Southern District of New York. 
 And it came as a bevy of Democratic members of Congress and presidential candidates demanded 
 that Acosta resign because of his role as then-U.S. Attorney in Miami in signing off on a deal to not 
 prosecute Epstein in the mid-2000s. 
 Epstein, 66, is accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005 after they 
 were brought to his luxurious residences on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and in Palm Beach, 
 Fla. 
 EFTA00018398
Epstein was being eyed for the same alleged conduct in Florida that federal prosecutors have now 
 charged him with in Manhattan. 
 A Justice Department official on Tuesday said that Barr consulted with career ethics officials at the 
 department, and concluded he did not have to recuse himself from the current prosecution in 
 Manhattan. 
 However, Barr was quoted Monday as saying he was recusing himself from the Epstein case. 
 "I'm recused from that matter because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a 
 firm I subsequently joined for a period of time," Barr told reporters on Monday. 
 Barr joined that law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, in 2009. 
 Kirkland & Ellis had represented Epstein in 2008, when he was being investigated in Florida. 
 Barr's comment Monday seems to have referred — or does so now — to his continued recusal from 
 the Justice Department's internal probe into the non-prosecution of Epstein as signed off by Acosta. 
 "Due to his prior association with Kirkland and Ellis, the Attorney General has and will remain 
 recused from any retrospective review of the resolution of the earlier [Southern District of Florida] 
 matter," the Justice Department official told CNBC on Tuesday.

 Company on behalf of Epstein's customers. We are told that up until his arrest Epstein was trading currencies 
 through Deutsche for his client. We are told that Deutsche is considering going into bankruptcy court to take 
 control of these assets and is coordinating its efforts with your office. can you give me any guidance on this for 
 our story

 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
  x 
 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
 S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 Defendant. 
 x 
 COUNT ONE 
 (Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
 Illegal Sex Acts) 
 The Grand Jury charges: 
 OVERVIEW 
 1. The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
 of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
 and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
 particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
 at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
 contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
 other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
 abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
 of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
 groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
 2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
 abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
 Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
 EFTA00018407
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 2 of 18 
 Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
 intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
 sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
 MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
 including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
 herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 3. During the time periods charged in this 
 Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
 professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
 closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
 in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
 Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
 properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
 Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
 including in the below image: 
 EFTA00018408
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 3 of 18 
 4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
 engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
 means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
 a. MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
 Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
 asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
 families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
 friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
 victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
 involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
 victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
 time alone with a minor victim. 
 b. Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
 MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
 by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
 front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
 undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
 victim and Epstein. 
 c. MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
 interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
 minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
 Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman . 
 was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
 3 
 EFTA00018409
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 4 of 18 
 massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
 MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
 including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
 be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
 Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
 d. In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
 minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
 opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
 Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
 indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
 help them. 
 e. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
 enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
 some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
 sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
 the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
 5. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
 Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
 sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
 engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
 resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
 touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
 placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals,

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 5 of 18 
 directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
 directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
 MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
 6. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
 about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
 Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
 things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
 inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
 were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
 following: 
 a. A a multi-story private residence on the 
 Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
 "New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
 photograph: 
 EFTA00018411
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 6 of 18 
 b. An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
 Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
 folloKing photograph: 
 c. A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
 Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
 following photograph:

 EFTA00018412
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 7 of 18 
 d. MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
 England. 
 7. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
 MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
 Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
 particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
 MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
 respect to minor victims: 
 a. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
 Victim -I was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
 interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
 Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
 age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
 place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
 Victim -1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
 means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
 Victim -1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
 MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
 family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
 normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
 things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
 when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
 first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
 began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
 7 
 EFTA00018413
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 8 of 18 
 and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
 involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
 During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
 Victim -1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
 MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
 residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
 Victim -1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
 Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
 lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
 MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
 Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
 properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
 b. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
 least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
 New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
 Victim -2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
 Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
 subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
 Victim -2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
 Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
 MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
 Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
 2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
 Victim -2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
 8 
 EFTA00018414
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 9 of 18 
 an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
 Victim -2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
 massage Epstein. 
 c. MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
 Victim -3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
 including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
 Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
 MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
 Victim -3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
 arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
 Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
 Victim -3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
 in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
 Victim -3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
 during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
 MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
 Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
 Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
 of a sexualized massage. 
 MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
 8. In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
 as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
 repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
 regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

 Re: United States v. Chislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of 
 August 10, 2020 (the "Defense Letter" or "Def. Ltr."), requesting that the Court order the 
 Government to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses 1I months prior to trial, and 
 requesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of 
 the Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied. 
 A. The Defendant's Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses 
 For the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the 
 Court for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2020 (Dkt. 28) 
 (denying the defendant's request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and 
 attorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements "concerning this case"); Order 
 dated July 30, 2020 (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant's application for a protective order that would 
 allow the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant's most recent 
 application, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the 
 form of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the "Indictment"), 
 fully 11 months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of 
 discovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
 had no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
 including for witness lists and 3500 material. 
 In the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production, 
 arguing that "almost six weeks since" the arrest of the defendant, the Government is "just now 
 beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would 
 begin as soon as the Court entered a protective order." Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the 
 Government somehow delayed that initial production is nonsense. As the Court is aware, the

ATTACHMENT A 
 I. Premises to be Searched—Subject Premises 
 1. The premises to be searched (the "Subject Premises") are described as a multi-story 
 single-family residence located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, and include all locked 
 and closed containers found therein. A photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises 
 is included below: 
 IL Items to Be Seized 
 A. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of the Subject Offenses 
 This warrant authorizes the seizure of certain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of 
 violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex 
 trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
 The items to be seized from the Subject Premises are any computer devices and storage 
 media that may contain any electronically stored information falling within the categories set forth 
 in Section B of this Attachment, including, but not limited to, desktop and laptop computers, disk 
 drives, modems, thumb drives, personal digital assistants, smart phones, digital cameras, scanners, 
 routers, modems, and network equipment used to connect to thd Internet. In lieu of seizing any 
 such computer devices or storage media, this warrant also authorizes, in the alternative, the 
 copying of such devices or media for later review. 
 The items to be seized from the Subject Premises also include: 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00018427
1. Any items or records needed to access the data stored on any seized or copied 
 computer devices or storage media, including but not limited to any physical keys, encryption 
 devices, or records of login credentials, passwords, private encryption keys, or similar information. 
 2. My items or records that may facilitate a forensic examination of the computer 
 devices or storage media, including any hardware or software manuals or other information 
 concerning the configuration of the seized or copied computer devices or storage media. 
 3. Any evidence concerning the identities or locations of those persons with access to, 
 control over, or ownership of the seized or copied computer devices or storage media. 
 B. Search and Seizure of Electronically Stored Information 
 As set forth in Section A to this attachment, this warrant authorizes the search of the Subject 
 Premises for any computer devices and storage media that may contain any electronically stored 
 information falling within the categories set forth below: 
 4. Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims 
 of the Subject Offenses; 
 5. Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses; 
 6. My nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
 appear to be teenage girls, or younger; 
 7. Records or other items that evidence ownership, control, or use of, or access to 
 devices, storage media, and related electronic equipment used to access, transmit, or store 
 information relating to the Subject Offenses, including, but not limited to, sales receipts, 
 warranties, bills for Internet access, handwritten notes, registry entries, configuration files, saved 
 usernames and passwords, user profiles, e-mail contacts, and photographs; 
 8. My child erotica, defined as suggestive visual depictions of nude minors that do 
 not constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). 
 C. Review of ESI 
 Law enforcement personnel (including, in addition to law enforcement officers and agents, 
 and depending on the nature of the ESI and the status of the investigation and related proceedings, 
 attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the government in 
 this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) will create a forensic 
 image of the Subject Devices (if practicable) and review the ESI contained therein for information 
 responsive to the warrant, that is, for the materials specified in Section B of this Attachment. 
 In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to 
 determine which files or other ESI contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such 
 techniques may include, for example: 
 2 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00018428
• surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to 
 looking at the outside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer 
 believed to contain pertinent files); 
 • conducting a file-by-file review by "opening" or reading the first few "pages" of such 
 files in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory 
 examination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its relevance); 
 • "scanning" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted data or 
 deliberately hidden files; and 
 • performing electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to 
 determine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of 
 the investigation6; and 
 • reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry data, and any 
 other information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. 
 . Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, 
 documents, or other electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section 
 ILA of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a 
 complete review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its 
 contents and to locate all data responsive to the warrant. 
 6 Keyword searches alone are typically inadequate to detect all relevant data. For one thing, 
 keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files, such as images and videos, do 
 not store data as searchable text. Moreover, even as to text data, there may be information properly 
 subject to seizure but that is not captured by a keyword search because the information does not 
 contain the keywords being searched.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 41 Filed 08/13/20 Page 2 of 5 
 Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 13, 2020 
 Page 2 
 protective order was docketed on Friday, July 31, 2020'—the timing of which was principally the 
 result of the defendant's own refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed protective order. The 
 Government then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than 12,000 
 pages the following Wednesday, August 5, 2020. Additionally, the Government continues to 
 produce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense 
 counsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than 150,000 pages, principally consisting of 
 financial records.2 Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of 
 electronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial 
 discovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has 
 now produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 21, 2020, and 
 approximately 11 months prior to trial. 
 In sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations, 
 providing more than 165,000 pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks following the 
 entry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the 
 general topics and sources of the materials. 
 Against this backdrop, the Defense Letter claims that over the course of just five days, 
 defense counsel determined, having "expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level 
 content," Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based 
 on the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the 
 defendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied. 
 Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in 
 the litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately 11 months before 
 trial —nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel, 
 United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975), although the opinion acknowledged 
 the ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the 
 Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to do so in that case 
 because the defendant there, as here, had made "only an abstract, conclusory claim that such 
 disclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial." Id. at 301-02. In United States v. 
 Rueb, 00 Cr. 091 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at '8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001), while the Court ordered 
 the Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial, 
 following the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those 
 circumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District 
 of New York opinion from 2009 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court 
 ' The Defense Letter states that the protective order was "entered" by the Court on July 30, 2020. 
 While that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on 
 July 31, 2020. 
 2 The Government's most recent discovery transmittal letter also included the months and years of 
 birth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether 
 she will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline 
 for any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.

Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA 
 New York Times 
 By James B. Stewart, Matthew Goldstein and Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 7/31/19 
 Jeffrey E. Epstein, the wealthy financier who is accused of sex trafficking, had an unusual dream: He hoped to 
 seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch. 
 Mr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar 
 with his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition. 
 Mr. Epstein's vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the 
 science of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial 
 intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of 
 improving the human race through controlled breeding. 
 Mr. Epstein, who was charged in July with the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14, was a serial illusionist: 
 He lied about the identities of his clients, his wealth, his financial prowess, his personal achievements. But he 
 managed to use connections and charisma to cultivate valuable relationships with business and political leaders. 
 Interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the same 
 tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in 
 eugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics. 
 Lawyers for Mr. Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking charges, did not respond to requests 
 for comment. 
 Mr. Epstein attracted a glittering array of prominent scientists. They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist 
 Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen 
 Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and 
 best-selling author; George M. Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be 
 altered to create superior humans; and the M.I.T. theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate. 
 The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some of 
 the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, and 
 even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. 
 Scientists gathered at dinner parties at Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion, where Dom Perignon and expensive 
 wines flowed freely, even though Mr. Epstein did not drink. He hosted buffet lunches at Harvard's Program for 
 Evolutionary Dynamics, which he had helped start with a $6.5 million donation. 
 Others flew to conferences sponsored by Mr. Epstein in the United States Virgin Islands and were feted on his 
 private island there. Once, the scientists — including Mr. Hawking — crowded on board a submarine that Mr. 
 Epstein had chartered. 
 The Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker said he was invited by colleagues — including Martin 
 Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and biology, and the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss — to 
 "salons and coffee klatsches" at which Mr. Epstein would hold court. 
 While some of Mr. Pinker's peers hailed Mr. Epstein as brilliant, Mr. Pinker described him as an "intellectual 
 impostor." 
 EFTA00018442
"He would abruptly change the subject, A.D.D.-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack," Mr. 
 Pinker said. 
 Another scientist cultivated by Mr. Epstein, Jaron Lanier, a prolific author who is a founding father of virtual 
 reality, said that Mr. Epstein's ideas did not amount to science, in that they did not lend themselves to rigorous 
 proof. Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace. 
 Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. 
 Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor. 
 Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was 
 bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you. 
 At one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor 
 because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had 
 rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have 
 more children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been 
 "voted off the island" and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein's gatherings. 
 Then there was Mr. Epstein's interest in eugenics. 
 On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his 
 ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would 
 give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and 
 wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it. 
 It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a 
 gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. 
 One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other 
 recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin 
 Islands. 
 The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the 
 law. 
 Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a 
 scientist who told him that Mr. Epstein's goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-square-
 foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as working at 
 NASA, but he did not remember her name. 
 According to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts of 
 the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted to 
 strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. The 
 repository discontinued operations in 1999.) 
 Mr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the 
 dinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen 
 candidates to bear Mr. Epstein's children. 
 Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA. 
 One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier's interest in cryonics, an 
 unproven science in which people's bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told 
 this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen. 
 EFTA00018443
Southern Trust Company, Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island-incorporated business, disclosed in a local filing that it was 
 engaged in DNA analysis. Calls to Southern Trust, which sponsored a science and math fair for school children 
 in the Virgin Islands in 2014, were not returned. 
 In 2011, a charity established by Mr. Epstein gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, which 
 now operates under the name Humanity Plus. The group's website says that its goal is "to deeply influence a new 
 generation of thinkers who dare to envision humanity's next steps." 
 Mr. Epstein's foundation, which is now defunct, also gave $100,000 to pay the salary of Ben Goertzel, vice 
 chairman of Humanity Plus, according to Mr. Goertzel's résumé. 
 "I have no desire to talk about Epstein right now," Mr. Goertzel said in an email to The New York Times. "The 
 stuff I'm reading about him in the papers is pretty disturbing and goes way beyond what I thought his misdoings 
 and kinks were. Yecch." 
 Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of law at Harvard, recalled that at a lunch Mr. Epstein hosted in 
 Cambridge, Mass., he steered the conversation toward the question of how humans could be improved 
 genetically. Mr. Dershowitz said he was appalled, given the Nazis' use of eugenics to justify their genocidal 
 effort to purify the Aryan race. 
 Yet the lunches persisted. 
 "Everyone speculated about whether these scientists were more interested in his views or more interested in his 
 money," said Mr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein's defense lawyers in the 2008 case. 
 Luminaries at Mr. Epstein's St. Thomas conference in 2006 included Mr. Hawking and the Caltech theoretical 
 physicist Kip S. Thorne. One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, 
 recalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome. Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated 
 with how certain traits were passed on, and how that could result in superior humans. 
 Mr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through John Brockman, a literary agent 
 whose best-selling science writers include Richard Dawkins, Daniel Goleman and Jared Diamond. Mr. 
 Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. 
 For two decades, Mr. Brockman presided over a series of salons that matched his scientist-authors with potential 
 benefactors. (The so-called "billionaires' dinners" apparently became a model for the gatherings at Mr. Epstein's 
 East 71st Street townhouse, which included some of the same guests.) 
 In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif, where Mr. Epstein 
 was introduced to scientists, including Seth Lloyd, the M.I.T. physicist. Mr. Lloyd said that he found Mr. Epstein 
 to be "charming" and to have "interesting ideas," although they "turned out to be quite vague." 
 Also at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockman's Edge Foundation, 
 were the Google founders Sergey Brim and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos, who was accompanied by his mother. 
 "All the good-looking women were sitting with the physicists' table," Daniel Dubno, who was a CBS producer at 
 the time and attended the dinner, was quoted as saying. Mr. Dubno told The Times that he did not recall the 
 dinner or having said those words. 
 Mr. Brockman was Mr. Gell-Mann's agent, and Mr. Gell-Mann, in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 
 book "The Quark and the Jaguar," thanked Mr. Epstein for his financial support. 
 EFTA00018444
However impressive his roster of scientific contacts, Mr. Epstein could not resist embellishing it. He claimed on 
 one of his websites to have had "the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists," including Mr. Pinker, 
 Mr. Thorne and the M.I.T. mathematician and geneticist Eric S. Lander. 
 Mr. Pinker said he had never taken any financial or other support from Mr. Epstein. "Needless to say, I find 
 Epstein's behavior reprehensible," he said. 
 Mr. Thorne, who recently won a Nobel Prize, said he attended Mr. Epstein's 2006 conference, believing it to be 
 co -sponsored by a reputable research center. Other than that, "I have had no contact with, relationship with, 
 affiliation with or funding from Epstein," he said. "I unequivocally condemn his abhorrent actions involving 
 minors." 
 Lee McGuire, a spokesman for Mr. Lander, said he has had no relationship with Mr. Epstein. "Mr. Epstein 
 appears to have made up lots of things," Mr. McGuire said, "and this seems to be among them." 
 Some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new charges in South Florida 
 South Florida Sun Sentinel 
 By Marc Freeman 
 7/30/19 
 Financier Jeffrey Epstein has been branded a pervert and an abuser, but not all of his victims want to see him 
 prosecuted further in South Florida. 
 Some of the girls Epstein assaulted at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 have already reached financial 
 settlements with him and fear they'll lose their anonymity. Federal prosecutors — the ones who approved his 
 lenient plea deal to begin with — say they fully support that position. 
 Epstein faces separate federal sex trafficking charges in New York, but the debate about prosecuting him in 
 South Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West Palm Beach is considering whether to strike 
 down parts of a controversial 2007 deal that gave him and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from federal 
 charges. 
 U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement violated the 
 federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark about it until after it had 
 been finalized. 
 Marra must decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for two of 
 Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. 
 The victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are 
 long overdue charges in Florida. 
 "To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New 
 York," their lawyers wrote. "But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's crimes 
 in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large." 
 Lawyers for the U.S. government disagree. 
 They concede that prosecutors back then "fell short" of treating victims properly as they reached a settlement 
 with Epstein. But the attorneys now contend "the past cannot be undone" and the deal must be upheld under the 
 law. 
 Among their arguments is that many victims clearly want to let it go, because they are content with financial 
 settlements they obtained from Epstein, and his 2008 guilty plea to two state prostitution charges. That plea

 ordered disclosure of a certain victim identity shortly after the indictment, the Court noted that the 
 Government had already confirmed to the defendant the identities of three of the four relevant 
 victims, and that a fourth victim, whose identity was at issue, was the subject of a charge that failed 
 to identify the date of her alleged rape or any prior encounters between the victim and the 
 defendant. 2009 WL 427111, at *2. None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the 
 Indictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the 
 defendant's conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.' 
 To the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges 
 against her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such 
 motion can be made in December with all other motions and following the completion of 
 discovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of 
 this case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be 
 meaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery. See United States v. 
 Mahabub, 13 Cr. 908 (AJN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2014) (denying a 
 motion for a bill of particulars that sought, among other things, the "alleged victim and noting that 
 "[a] bill of particulars is not required unless the charges of the indictment are so general that they 
 do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused. The government can also 
 discharge its obligation to disclose this information by other means, such as by presenting evidence 
 in discovery. . . . A bill of particulars is not meant to provide the details of the government's 
 evidence, or to be used as an investigative tool.") (emphasis added, quotations and citations 
 omitted); see also United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *7 
 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars and noting that such motions 
 are not "a general investigative tool, a discovery device or a means to compel the government to 
 disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial") (emphasis added) (quotations and 
 citation omitted); cf. United States v. Sindone, 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *2 
 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars to identify "the unnamed 
 alleged victim(s)" but instructing the government to disclose the name of any victim it did not 
 intend to call as a witness at trial by 14 days prior to the start of trial). 
 Alternatively, to the extent defense counsel is unable to assess or comprehend the discovery 
 produced by the Government, the Government is more than willing to discuss with the defense 
 3 Defense counsel's invocation of the protective order in support of its argument, Def. Ltr. at I, 3, 
 should be of little comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the 
 defendant's counsel who represent her in both this criminal matter as well as in certain civil 
 matters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials 
 in discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant's counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing 
 that they purportedly had received "critical new information" from the criminal case that it could 
 not disclose "because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action," and further noting 
 publicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in 
 the civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
 No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. 1100). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to 
 scrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal 
 standards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief. 
 EFTA00017834
resulted in 13 months in Palm Beach County Jail and registering as a sex offender. 
 The prosecutors say they reached this position based on "conversations" with the victims and their lawyers, 
 without giving a specific number. 
 Attorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's 
 Office in April. 
 "She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail," Kuvin said. "She said, `I don't know if that's a 
 realistic possibility, but that's what I want.'" 
 He said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. 
 "When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be 
 handled," Kuvin said. "But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come 
 forward ... is enough to put him away." 
 The federal prosecutors explained that while some victims "would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, 
 they valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in 
 any criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or the 
 public." 
 This is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, 
 wrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. 
 Kitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. 
 But they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still "exacerbates the harm to 
 victims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim." 
 Kuvin said he agrees, "It's a valid concern for some of the victims." 
 Attorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's reasoning 
 to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. 
 Lawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to 
 prosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. 
 The lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the 
 prosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. 
 "The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no 
 credence from the Court," wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane Doe 
 I and Jane Doe 2. 
 They also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged "risk" to some victims outweighs 
 obtaining justice for their clients. 
 "But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous," they wrote this 
 month. 
 Epstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal 
 shouldn't be blown up to allow new charges. 
 Jeffrey Epstein faces 'a million pages' of evidence: defense lawyer 
 EFTA00018446
New York Post 
 By Andrew Denney and Bruce Golding 
 7/31/19 
 Prosecutors have 1 million pages of evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, his lawyer revealed in court Monday —
 without shedding any new light on the jailhouse incident that left the convicted pedophile with bruises on his 
 neck. 
 No marks were visible on Epstein's neck, and he never appeared to be in pain during the 15-minute hearing in 
 Manhattan federal court. 
 The judge overseeing the case tentatively scheduled Epstein's trial for June 2020 after a prosecutor said the child 
 sex -trafficking charges against him should be resolved as "swiftly as possible." 
 "We don't think any delay in this is in the public interest," Manhattan Assistant US Attorney said. 
 Epstein's trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and the defense will have all the prosecution's evidence 
 against the multimillionaire financier by Oct. 31, she said. 
 Defense lawyer Martin Weinberg objected to starting the trial before September 2020, saying, "We need time to 
 review a million pages of discovery." 
 But Judge Richard Berman said he was blocking out time in June 2020 on the presumption that the defense 
 would be ready by then. 
 Weinberg didn't make any mention of the July 23 incident in which law enforcement sources have said Epstein, 
 66, was found sprawled on the floor of his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he's being held 
 without bail. 
 Weinberg declined to answer questions about the incident outside court. 
 Epstein, who wore dark blue jail scrubs over a brown T-shirt, didn't speak during the hearing. 
 He's pleaded not guilty to accusations he sexually abused dozens of underage girls - some as young as 14 — in 
 his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. 
 Berman set a Sept. 13 deadline for defense motions in the case, and Weinberg said he planned to seek dismissal 
 of a conspiracy charge on grounds of double jeopardy tied to allegations that underpinned a non-prosecution 
 agreement that Epstein struck in 2008 with then-Miami US Attorney Alex Acosta. 
 That deal was exposed last year in an award-winning series of stories by the Miami Herald, and controversy that 
 erupted following Epstein's July 6 arrest forced Acosta to resign as President Trump's labor secretary. 
 Jeffrey Epstein appears in court for first time since reported jail injuries 
 The Guardian 
 By Victoria Bekiempis 
 7/31/19 
 Financier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in his 
 sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. 
 He wore dark blue jail scrubs during his brief appearance in Manhattan federal criminal court on Wednesday 
 morning, in a proceeding scheduled before the apparent incident behind bars last week. 
 There were no signs of injuries that had been reported at the time and he appeared well and more neatly 
 presented than at some previous hearings. 
 EFTA00018447
The Jeffrey Epstein scandal 
 His lawyers did not bring up the incident in court and refused to comment on the topic following the hearing, 
 which focused on scheduling issues. 
 Prosecutor asked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: "We don't think that any delay 
 in this case is in the public interest." 
 The Manhattan US attorney's office alleged earlier in July that Epstein "sexually exploited and abused dozens of 
 minor girls" from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. 
 The disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago. 
 Epstein has long been accused of sexually abusing underage girls. He also has purported connections to Donald 
 Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite circles, including for several years in a relationship 
 with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. 
 Epstein and the Miami US attorney's office, headed at the time by Alexander Acosta, brokered a plea deal in 
 2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 teenage girls. 
 Under this arrangement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than 
 if he had faced federal charges. The Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown exposed the secretive nature of this 
 agreement. Acosta resigned from his post as Trump's labor secretary following extensive criticism of the deal. 
 Epstein has unsuccessfully requested bail while awaiting trial. The 66-year-old, who registered as a sex offender 
 following the Florida case, had maintained through lawyers that he neither posed a danger nor risk of flight. 
 In rejecting Epstein's request, Judge Richard Berman said, "the government has established danger to others and 
 to the community by clear and convincing evidence", adding: "I doubt that any bail package can overcome a 
 danger to the community." 
 Epstein's lawyers are appealing against the decision, according to court filings. 
 Late last week, Judge Berman also ruled in favor of prosecutors' proposed protective order, which will keep case 
 materials relating to "the government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals" under wraps. 
 Judge sets tentative date for Jeffrey Epstein's trial 
 Associated Press 
 By Larry Neumeister and Jim Mustian 
 7/31/19 
 A subdued Jeffrey Epstein listened passively in court Wednesday as a judge said he won't face trial on sex 
 trafficking charges before June 2020, and more likely a few months afterward. 
 There was no mention at the Manhattan federal court appearance or any visible sign of injuries after the 66-year-
 old financier was found on the floor of his cell last week with neck bruises. 
 Epstein's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, refused to say what might have left his client with neck bruises after the court 
 hearing. 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney urged a June trial date for the man accused of arranging to have sex with 
 girls as young as age 14, saying there is "a public interest in bringing this case to trial as swiftly as possible." 
 But Weinberg said the case is far from "ordinary," adding the defense team won't be ready before Labor Day 
 2020. He said prosecutors delayed bringing charges that relate to alleged crimes that occurred in the early 2000s 
 at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Florida. 
 EFTA00018448
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said a trial projected to last four to six weeks could tentatively begin 
 June 8, but he'll likely defer to defense lawyers' needs if they are not ready. 
 Epstein's demeanor in court was noticeably different from previous appearances, when he was actively engaged 
 with his lawyers and looking through papers. 
 On Wednesday, he sat quietly, his hands folded in front of his face through much of the 20-minute proceeding. 
 Occasionally, he looked toward courtroom artists and reporters seated in a jury box. 
 Epstein has remained at the Metropolitan Correction Center, which is adjacent to the downtown Manhattan 
 courthouse. 
 He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges that carry the potential for up to 45 years in prison. 
 Berman refused bail after concluding he is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Prosecutors have said 
 they fear he might try to influence a growing number of witnesses who support charges that he recruited and 
 abused dozens of girls in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. His lawyers had argued he should be allowed 
 to stay under house arrest in his Manhattan mansion. 
 His lawyers say an agreement reached with federal prosecutors a dozen years ago disallows the charges and they 
 say he has committed no new crimes. 
 The lawyers agreed to file written arguments about the agreement and double jeopardy claims by Sept. 13. Oral 
 arguments will occur in October. 
 The non-prosecution deal was reached before he pleaded guilty in state court in Florida to prostitution-related 
 charges involving underage girls. Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to 
 many victims. While he served a 13-month jail term, he was permitted to leave jail to work for 12 hours a day, 
 six days a week. 
 Epstein was arrested July 6 when he arrived at a New Jersey airport on a private jet from Paris, where he has a 
 home. 
 Did Jeffrey Epstein try to kill himself? He and his lawyer, back in court, aren't saying

 Victims of Jeffrey Epstein share the emotional toll that sexual abuse has taken on them — even years after the 
 abuse occurred. Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown interviewed the young women, most speaking for the first 
 time about Epstein. BY EMILY MICHOT I JULIE K. BROWN 
 For the first time since he was found semi-conscious in his jail cell with telltale bruise marks on his neck, 
 accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein appeared in a Manhattan court room. 
 Epstein — onetime friend of the rich and powerful, including current President Donald Trump and past President 
 Bill Clinton — learned Wednesday that he will not face trial until at least next June. 
 The multimillionaire part-time resident of Palm Beach sat subdued in front of U.S. District Court Judge Richard 
 M. Berman. The 66-year-old defendant wore dark blue jail scrubs and glasses. 
 His lawyer, Martin Weinberg, declined to reveal any details about the incident at the Metropolitan Correctional 
 Center, which occurred July 23, including whether it was a suicide attempt, an attack by a fellow detainee or 
 something else. His client is being held without bond. 
 Wednesday's hearing in New York City lasted just 15 minutes. 
 EFTA00018449
Epstein, a financier who owns homes around the world, including a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, was 
 arrested July 6, nearly eight months after the Miami Herald published Perversion of Justice, a two-year 
 investigation of a much-reviled secret plea deal in 2007-2008 that spared Epstein a sweeping federal indictment 
 despite allegations of sexual abuse by nearly three dozen underage girls. 
 He had just arrived from France at New Jersey's Teterboro airport on his private jet when authorities met him 
 and took him into custody. 
 During the early- and mid-2000s, Epstein allegedly ran what amounted to a sexual pyramid scheme, using 
 recruiters to lure girls as young as 14 to his lavish Palm Beach and Manhattan mansions with the promise that 
 they would receive $200 to give a man a massage. The girls have alleged that they were coerced into sex. 
 The girls were paid additional money if they would recruit others girls, police and court records allege. Epstein 
 had assistants schedule as many as three visits a day. 
 Rather than face federal charges that could have put him away for life, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court to 
 minor prostitution charges and served just a year in the county stockade — which permitted him to leave the 
 lockup for his luxurious downtown West Palm Beach office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. This "work 
 release" arrangement, highly unusual for a sex offender, is now under criminal investigation by order of the Palm 
 Beach sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, who oversees the stockade and approved the work release. 
 Although Assistant U.S. Attorney said it is important to move swiftly ahead with Epstein's court 
 case, his defense attorney said he needs time in light of the approximately one million pages of documents that 
 that comprise the evidence collected against his client. 
 Labor Secretary Alex Acosta held a press conference to defend his role in handling the Jeffrey Epstein sexual 
 abuse case. Acosta was a U.S. Attorney who approved the Epstein plea deal in 2008. By CSPAN 
 In the meantime, Epstein will be given a chance to argue that the non-prosecution agreement, executed in 2008, 
 gave him, his schedulers, his alleged madam and others immunity from federal charges and that the new charges 
 constitute impermissible double jeopardy. 
 In its series of articles, the Herald highlighted the role of Alexander Acosta, then-U.S. attorney for the Southern 
 District of Florida, in approving the immunity agreement, including a controversial stipulation that Epstein's 
 accusers not be told of the arrangement. Facing searing criticism after Epstein's arrest, Acosta resigned his post 
 as President Trump's labor secretary. 
 Jeffrey Epstein could face sex trafficking trial next June 
 Reuters 
 7/31/19 
 Financier Jeffrey Epstein could go to trial on charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as 
 early as next June, though his lawyers told a court on Wednesday they may need more time. 
 At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors sought a June 2020 trial date, while a lawyer for Epstein 
 asked that it wait another three months. 
 The lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said Epstein and his legal team needed more time to review evidence, expected to 
 total more than 1 million pages. 
 U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tentatively set aside time for a trial beginning June 8, but 
 revisit the issue later. He said he normally allowed defendants more time to prepare if they wished. 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney said a trial is expected to last four to six weeks. 
 EFTA00018450
Prosecutors have accused Epstein of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude "massages" and 
 other sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others. Epstein has pleaded not guilty. 
 Wednesday's hearing occurred one week after Epstein was reportedly found unconscious and with neck injuries 
 in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan. 
 Epstein, dressed in blue jail scrubs, had no visible injuries on Wednesday. His lawyers declined to comment on 
 the reports after the hearing. 
 Epstein is appealing Berman's July 18 denial of his request to remain under house arrest in his $77 million 
 mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side while awaiting trial. 
 The charges against Epstein focus on alleged misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005. 
 They followed Epstein's 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges in Florida, in exchange for the Justice 
 Department's agreement not to prosecute him on similar charges. 
 Epstein served 13 months in jail and agreed to register as a sex offender under the 2008 agreement, which is now 
 widely considered too lenient. 
 His lawyers have argued this month that the agreement barred federal prosecutors in Manhattan from pursuing 
 the current case over the same conduct. Weinberg said at Wednesday's hearing that they intended to file motions 
 on the issue. 
 U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is overseeing the current case, has said there is no such bar. 
 Epstein Lawyers Ask for a Year to Review a Million Pages 
 Bloomberg 
 By Chris Dolmetsch , Bob Van Voris , and Patricia Hurtado 
 7/31/19 
 Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a blizzard of documents prosecutors have 
 gathered against the fund manager as they prepare to defend him against charges of sex trafficking in minors and 
 conspiracy. 
 Prosecutors asked a judge to schedule Epstein's trial for next June, but defense attorney Martin Weinberg said his 
 team wanted to wait until September 2020, because they haven't yet begun to receive documents from the 
 government. 
 "We need time to receive a million pages of discovery and prepare to defend a four- to six-week trial," Weinberg 
 said during a brief hearing in Manhattan on Wednesday. "We need time to assess events that occurred 14 to 17 
 years ago." 
 The judge set a tentative trial date of June 8 and asked the parties to keep him updated on their progress. 
 Epstein, who didn't speak in court, was arrested on July 6 after stepping off his private plane in New Jersey from 
 a trip to Paris. He has pleaded not guilty and said he has fully complied with the law for more than 14 years. 
 Marks on Neck 
 Epstein is accused of molesting teenage girls from 2002 to 2005. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state 
 charges of soliciting prostitution, after striking a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Federal prosecutors in 
 New York say they are not bound by the deal as they now pursue their own charges. 
 EFTA00018451
In court Wednesday, there was no discussion of what happened to the 66-year-old Epstein last week at New 
 York's Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he has been held since his arrest. People familiar with the matter 
 said he was found injured and unresponsive in his cell, with marks on his neck. Authorities are investigating 
 whether he was assaulted, possibly by another inmate, or whether the injuries were self-inflicted. Weinberg 
 declined to respond to questions about the incident outside court. 
 Also in court was Gloria Allred, the activist lawyer who has represented women accusing Roy Moore, Bill 
 Cosby and President Donald Trump of sexual assault. After the hearing, she said she was representing other 
 Epstein accusers who "were not in the Florida case." She said other women have approached her about their 
 experiences with Epstein but were reluctant to discuss them for fear of retaliation. 
 The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, has urged others who may be victims to come forward and 
 cooperate with the government. Allred declined to say whether her clients have spoken to prosecutors. 
 The case is U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
 Collins 
 Editorial: Failures of ethics 
 Buffalo News 
 By News Editorial Board 
 7/29/19 
 The ethics specialists are right and so are the members of a special ethics panel, including both Democrats and 
 Republicans, who are paying attention. Good for them. The conduct of Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, exposed 
 a range of issues Congress needs to treat as tumors, and cut them out. 
 Collins was indicted last year on allegations of insider trading. But he was routinely smashing ethical standards —
 of both formal and common sense varieties — before he was ever charged with a crime. 
 A year before Collins was indicted, the Office of Congressional Ethics reported that it found "a substantial 
 reason to believe" that Collins violated federal law by touting the stock of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an 
 Australian biotech firm, based on inside information. 
 The office also said Collins may have broken House ethics rules by persuading National Institutes of Health 
 officials to meet with a staffer from that company. 
 At least as troubling are the actions Collins took that were not deemed to be ethical violations. Speaking to a 
 bipartisan House task force charged with drawing up new ethics rules based on Collins' arrest, ethics experts 
 worried about lawmakers who sit on the boards of privately owned companies, or who serve as partners in other 
 businesses or who are directors of nonprofit organizations. Collins still does all three. 
 Earlier this year, in response to Collins' arrest, the House barred lawmakers from serving on the boards of 
 publicly traded companies. Collins did that, too, as a board member — and leading stockholder — of Innate 
 Immunotherapeutics. It's how prosecutors say he obtained the insider information that led to his arrest. 
 There was more. Collins authored a provision of the 2016 "21st Century Cures Act" that sped drug approval for 
 companies like Innate. Collins, with a straight face, claimed there was no conflict because Innate had no business 
 before U.S. regulators. But in 2017, the company practically beamed that it had "received clearance from the 
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application lodged last 
 month." 
 EFTA00018452
The fact that Collins' role in the legislation could also have benefited other companies — and may even have been 
 worthy of passage — does nothing to change the associated fact that he was pushing for legislation whose 
 adoption could have lined his pockets. It was classic self-dealing. 
 The drug in question was meant to treat multiple sclerosis. It failed in clinical trials in 2017 and prosecutors say 
 Collins illegally spread the word to family and others who were able to sell their stock before its price collapsed 
 on the bad news. 
 Collins has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is scheduled for February. But regardless of what a judge 
 or jury ultimately decides about Collins, he has shown himself to be indifferent to the need for a member of 
 Congress to conduct himself in a way that reflects well on the institution and on the voters who entrust him with 
 public office. 
 In that, he has shown Congress that it needs to act. It can't count on its members using good judgment, especially 
 when millions of dollars are at stake. 
 The good news is that it seems ready to meet that public obligation. It is considering measures that would 
 prohibit lawmakers from serving as partners in limited liability corporations, joining committees that oversee 
 their business interests and serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations. Staff members would also be 
 barred. 
 Sadly, some Republican members have defended Collins, despite the clear conflicts of interest. But the 
 Republican on the ethics task force, Rep. Van Taylor of Texas, expressed no disagreement with the panel's 
 Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, who said she expected to move "rather quickly" on writing new rules. 
 Taylor sees the tasks as "very narrow," focused on preventing lawmakers from serving in outside positions that 
 could pose conflicts. The remarkable thing is that those restrictions need to be put in writing. Thank Collins for 
 that. 
 Securities and Commodities Fraud 
 Stewart 
 Southern District Will Pursue A Retrial Of "Silver Platter" Case 
 Forbes 
 By Walter Pavlo 
 7/30/19 
 Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading charges back in May 2015 during U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's 
 reign over the Southern District of New York. Now, over four years since his indictment, Sean can reflect back 
 on a wild journey of being convicted, sentenced to 3 years prison, having that conviction overturned, being 
 released from prison halfway through his term and, now, having a new date to go back to trial to face the charges 
 again. 
 Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading for passing material non-public information on potential deals to his 
 father, Robert, who then passed it on to his former friend and trader, Richard Cunniffe. Sean, a Yale graduate 
 who had worked in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase and Perella Weinberg, mentioned some details about 
 his work while talking to Robert. Sean's information made it to Cunniffe who made over a million dollars on the 
 trades, sharing a small amount (less $100,000) with Robert. How much did Sean make on the trades? ZERO 
 dollars. He had no idea that Cunniffe traded because he did not even know who Cunniffe was. 
 It was a clear case of misappropriation where information was used without Sean's knowledge, so it was not a 
 "classical" insider trading case. However, Bharara's team of U.S. attorneys was looking for cases that targeted 
 EFTA00018453
wealthy Wall Street traders who seemed to have an advantage over the average trader. Sean's case was a good 
 fit. 
 Cunniffe was busted by the FBI and soon became a government informant, taping calls and other meetings with 
 Robert. In one of those calls, Robert stated that Sean said of the information he had passed on to Cunniffe, "I 
 can't believe it. I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest." So the primary evidence in the case, 
 the case that came to be known as the "silver platter" case, was based on a statement that was attributed to Sean. 
 It's a phrase that Sean's new defense team wants to be excluded from the proceedings. 
 When Robert was arrested, under duress of FBI questioning, he said nine (9) times that Sean was not in on his 
 scheme with Cunniffe (here is entire tape transcript here). Robert also admitted his own role and that of 
 Cunniffe's during the interrogation. When it came to trial, neither that tape nor Robert's testimony was allowed 
 because of legal maneuvering by prosecutors. The video tape was suppressed and Robert did not testify due to 
 threats from prosecutors that he would be charged for perjury due to his conflicting accounts. Here is what the 
 jury missed from that tape: 
 FBI AGENT: Tell me about the first time that Sean gave you information on a deal. 
 ROBERT STEWART: Well, uh, I wouldn't characterize any of these as — I mean Sean would mention stuff. I 
 don't think he had any idea that I would trade on any of this stuff Uh, I've never mentioned that I did, to him. 
 Ummm 
 AGENT: If that's true, how do you explain the comment you made to Rick [Cunniffe] that Sean got angry with 
 you when he gave you this information on a silver platter and you didn't invest. 
 ROBERT: Uhh, I think I was just saying that to Rick because Sean said, oh, you know, ahh, all these deals, you 
 know, you — if you were trading you could make like millions of dollars. And I said, you know, Sean, no 
 one's going to trade and make millions of dollars on this stuff. That wasn't his intention. 
 Robert took the 5th but did submit an affidavit that if he were to testify he would have said Sean did not know 
 about the trades by Cunniffe. 
 Looking back at the trial, there was not a single email, document, or text message that suggested that Sean was a 
 knowingly participated in the trading scheme. This is interesting since there were so many incriminating 
 documents between Cunniffe and Robert. There were no witnesses who gave testimony on Sean's knowledge 
 and intent, including Cunniffe, the cooperator, who on the stand acknowledged that he never knew Sean. 
 Furtnermore, trading records and actions undertaken by Sean suggest he did not know trading had taken place. 
 Last fall, the 2nd Circuit overturned Sean's conviction, something rare in most cases, especially a reversal on an 
 evidentiary ruling, which suggests the 2nd Circuit felt that Sean may be innocent and the judge's mistakes 
 resulted in an unfair trial. The appellate court ruled that Robert's post-arrest video interrogation should have 
 been allowed. Sean was released from prison and has been in legal limbo until the SDNY decided that they 
 would move to move forward with another trial on the same charges. 
 Stewart will have a new judge this time around. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain was replaced by Judge 
 Rakoff, a man who seems to be on a mission to define insider trading laws himself. He also has new attorneys 
 Steven M. Witzel, Lawrence Gerschwer, R. David Gallo and Leigh G. Rome of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & 
 Jacobson LLP. 
 If Sean is found guilty, he would face the prospect of being sentenced to prison and returning to prison to 
 complete a term. On the other hand, it would not be out of the question for Judge Rakoff to give him "time 
 served" in prison even if Sean is found guilty. Rakoff, not a fan of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, seems to 
 be one of those judges that uses common sense in his approach to sentencing. Earlier this week, Rakoff 
 EFTA00018454
sentenced a man to 14 months in prison for knowingly leaking insider information on Sherwin Williams' 
 acquisition of Valspar. 
 While Sean may have made some mistakes, these could have been handled by the companies he worked for and, 
 at the most severe, an enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SDNY seems intent 
 on trying to interpret insider trading laws by putting on elaborate trials with the threat of putting people in prison 
 for years. It is a waste of resources. 
 It looks like the ghost of Bharara still haunts the SDNY. 
 Thompson 
 Easton man accused of stealing $7M via fake Bitcoin transactions 
 Lehigh Valley Live 
 By Sarah Cassi 
 7/30/19 
 An Easton man who headed a cryptocurrency escrow company was arrested last week on federal charges he 
 allegedly stole $7 million from two companies by lying about Bitcoin transactions. 
 Jon Barry Thompson, also known as J. Barry Thompson, was the principal of Volantis, which included a 
 cryptocurrency escrow company called Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and a related company, Volantis Market 
 Making LCC. 
 The 48-year-old Thompson was arrested in Easton, and was charged with two counts each of commodities fraud 
 and wire fraud. Easton police assisted in serving the arrest warrant at 6:15 a.m. Thursday at Thompson's West 
 Burke Street home on College Hill. 
 What happens to the money when a criminal's stash is in bitcoin? 
 When a criminal's stash is in bitcoin, the stakes are now much higher in forfeiture cases with the soaring value of 
 the virtual currency. 
 Thompson was released after posting $500,000 bond. Messages left for comment at a phone number listed for 
 Thompson and for his defense attorney, Matthew Siembieda, were not immediately returned. 
 Prosecutors said Thompson stole $7 million from two companies after lying about transactions of the peer-to-
 peer digital currency Bitcoin — $3 million from one company and $4 million from a second. 
 Thompson offered minimized settlement default risk in cryptocurrency transactions, and claimed there was no 
 risk of default, prosecutors allege. 
 In June and July 2018, Thompson convinced the first company to send Volantis more than $3 million for a 
 Bitcoin purchase, prosecutors allege. Thompson allegedly assured the company he had the Bitcoin in hand and 
 that money could not be lost. 
 Thompson took the money, but never provided the company the promised Bitcoin or returned its money, 
 prosecutors said. 
 Thompson allegedly gave the company a fake account statement showing he had the company's money but in 
 reality sent the more than $3 million to a third-party entity purportedly in exchange for Bitcoin without first 
 receiving any of the Bitcoin in hand.

 any such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the 
 Government a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared 
 to engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure 
 of 3500 material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce 
 reasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2021 to permit the defense to investigate witnesses. 
 But particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government's strong desire to protect the 
 privacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant's request, the 
 Government respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly 
 three months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial 
 motions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the 
 identity of its witnesses. 
 B. The Defendant's Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement 
 The defendant's requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the 
 Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request 
 that the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") should also 
 be denied.' 
 As an initial matter, the defendant's argument that she is being treated "worse" than other 
 inmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is 
 entirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has 
 never before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison. 
 Additionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her 
 person or space as appropriate.5 It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific "privileges given to 
 other pretrial detainees" the defendant believes she is being denied. 
 More generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized 
 assessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons 
 including safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the 
 determination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style 
 accommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will 
 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made little 
 or no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government 
 learned of the defendant's specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time 
 from the Defense Letter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues 
 as appropriate. Moreover, as noted below, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the GOP's 
 plan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and 
 ultimately modify) that plan. 
 5 Defense counsel claims that prison staff "constantly observe" the defendant "including her phone 
 conversations with defense counsel." This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is 
 able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
 MDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete 
 calls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line. 
 EFTA00017835
In July 2018, Thompson allegedly convinced a second company to send Volantis more than $4 million for 
 Bitcoin purchases. Again, Thompson is accused of sending a substantial portion of the money to a third party 
 without first receiving any Bitcoin in return, prosecutors allege. 
 Thompson never gave the second company any Bitcoin and did not return its money, prosecutors said. 
 "Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis 
 Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase," 
 Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a news release. "As his clients soon realized, however, 
 Thompson's representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they 
 had entrusted with him because of his lies." 
 FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney said Thompson used phrases and terminology that the victimized 
 companies didn't understand, and he "allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency." 
 "Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest 
 in Bitcoin," Sweeney said. 
 The complaint doesn't identify the companies allegedly victimized by Thompson. 
 Forbes previously reported Symphony, an Irish investment company that specializes in trading cryptocurrencies, 
 gave Thompson 3.6 million Euros to purchase Bitcoin on its behalf. 
 Symphony never received any Bitcoin and its money was never returned. 
 In that case, the plaintiff withdrew the complaint it had brought in federal court in Pennsylvania and, instead, 
 reached a private settlement with Thompson. Thompson then breached the agreement by failing to make the first 
 settlement payment, Forbes reported. 
 Pinto-Thomaz 
 Popular Paint Brand Insider Trading Results In Prison Term: Feds 
 Patch 
 By Chris Dehnel 
 7/30/19 
 A former analyst for a major financial ratings agency is to spend more than a year in prison for an insider trading 
 scheme involving his hairdresser, a jeweler and two major paint brands sold prominently in Connecticut. 
 Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the southern district of New York, announced that Sebastian 
 Pinto-Thomaz, 34, a former credit ratings analyst at Standard & Poor's, was sentenced in Manhattan federal court 
 to 14 months in prison for participating in two schemes to trade on material, nonpublic information in advance of 
 the Sherwin-Williams Company's acquisition of the Valspar Corporation. 
 Valspar is the brand sold by Lowe's. 
 Pinto-Thomaz was convicted on April 26, following a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who 
 also imposed Monday's sentence. 
 In summarizing the case, Berman said, "As an employee of Standard & Poor's, Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz was 
 privy to potentially lucrative information about business acquisition plans. Instead of protecting that information, 
 EFTA00018456
as he had sworn to do, he shared it with a friend and with his hairdresser. In turn, they bet on a stock that they 
 knew to be a sure thing, and raked in nearly $300,000 in profits. Pinto-Thomaz painted himself into a corner 
 when he and his co-defendants exploited insider information to reap illegal profits. Now they all face time in 
 prison for their misdeeds." 
 When a company announces an acquisition, the acquiring company often seeks the opinion of a credit rating 
 agency regarding the potential impact that the acquisition could have on the acquiring company's 
 creditworthiness, Berman said. Therefore, companies often contact rating agencies before an acquisition is 
 publicly announced in order to secure the rating agency's views on how a possible acquisition could impact a 
 company's credit rating, he said. 
 All major rating agencies offer a service — sometimes known as a Rating Evaluation Service, or RES — that 
 provides the company with a rating committee decision with respect to a proposed acquisition. 
 In March 2016, Standard and Poor's, a credit rating agency in New York, assigned Pinto-Thomazto work on a 
 RES for the Sherwin-Williams Company in advance of its contemplated but unannounced acquisition of the 
 Valspar Corporation, according to casae records. 
 In connection with the assignment, Pinto-Thomaz received material, nonpublic or "inside" information the deal 
 about Sherwin-Williams's planned acquisition of Valspar prior to the public announcement of the acquisition. 
 S&P's written policies prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which included the 
 inside information, Berman said. 
 During his tenure at S&P, Pinto-Thomaz reviewed and certified his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to S&P 
 and its clients, according to case records. 
 In March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz passed the inside information about the paint merger to Jeremy Millul, a friend, 
 and to Abell Oujaddou, his hairdresser, so that they could "use it to make profitable trades in Valspar stock and 
 options.," Berman said. 
 On March 21, 2016, the first trading day after the public announcement of the acquisition, the price of Valspar 
 stock increased approximately 23 percent over the prior day's close. 
 Millul, a Manhattan jeweler opened a brokerage account on March 13, 2016, and shortly thereafter purchased 
 480 shares of Valspar common stock, case records show. On March 18, 2016, the last trading day before the 
 acquisition was publicly announced, Millul also purchased 75 out-of-the-money Valspar call options, according 
 to case records. 
 After the acquisition was publicly announced, Millul sold his Valspar stock and options for approximately 
 $106,806 in profits, Berman said. 
 Oujaddou, a Manhattan hairstylist and salon owner who has known Pinto-Thomaz for years and is a close friend 
 with his mother, was given inside information during a haircut on March 8 or 9, 2016, according to case records. 
 On March 10 through March 18, 2016, Oujaddou, who had never previously purchased Valspar or Sherwin-
 Williams purchased 8,630 shares of Valspar stock, case records show. 
 After the acquisition was publicly announced, Oujaddou sold his Valspar shares for approximately $192,080 in 
 profits, according to case records. 
 Following the trading, Oujaddou met Pinto-Thomaz in the paint aisle of a hardware store and paid him a 
 kickback, Berman said. 
 Pinto-Thomaz denied having a relationship with anyone on the list of pre-merger trading.

In addition to his prison term, Pinto-Thomaz was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to 
 pay a fine of $15,000 and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $7,500. 
 Millul and Oujaddou each previously pled guilty and were to be sentenced on July 30.

 Castro 
 Drug Dealer Forfeits Over $4M in Bitcoin as Part of a Guilty Plea 
 All Stocks 
 By Ravi Rd 
 7/31/19 
 According to a July 25 press release from the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New 
 York, the very active Bitcoin drug dealer Richard Castro has pleaded guilty of committing illicit activities such 
 as money laundering and distributing three controlled substances through the dark web and encrypted emails. 
 Castro was charged by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and agreed to forfeit more than $4 million including 
 cryptocurrency funds available in his seven different Bitcoin wallets. 
 Castro, 36-year-old based in Windermere, Florida, operated under multiple badges, such as "Chems_usa," 
 "Chemical_usa" and "Jagger109" to distribute three controlled opioid substances namely carfentanil, fentanyl, 
 and phenyl fentanyl. Dream Market and AlphaBay were two of his primary market places on the dark web, 
 where he sold drugs in exchange for cryptocurrency. 
 The three controlled opioid substances were sold from November 2015 to 2019 by Castro and another co-
 conspirator, Luis Fernandez. Fentanyl, the first of these three is considered to be significantly stronger than 
 heroin while Carfentanil is believed to be 100 times stronger than fentanyl. Castro sold these substances under 
 the three aforementioned monikers which ultimately used to prove that he is indeed the leader of this conspiracy. 
 On Dream Market, Castro once boasted about 3,200 transactions that he had completed on various dark web 
 marketplaces. Out of these 3,200 transactions, 1,800 transactions were successfully completed on AlphaBay 
 alone. The conspirators apparently also received many positive reviews for the quality of synthetic opioid 
 substance they were selling. 
 In June 218, Castro informed his clients that he would only accept orders received by encrypted emails and 
 declared the organization is getting the business off from the dark web. Customers who wanted to buy narcotics 
 had to acquire the address of the encrypted email from "Chems_usa" by paying certain fees. Unfortunately for 
 Castro, an undercover law enforcement officer also obtained the encrypted email and placed an order, which 
 ultimately led to his arrest. 
 Castro was accepting the payments in Bitcoin which were later distributed in seven different BTC wallets. 
 Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: 
 "As he admitted today, for years, Richard Castro used the dark web to distribute prolific quantities of powerful 
 opioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil. Castro thought he could hide behind the anonymity of the interne, 
 and use online pseudonyms to deal drugs — like `Chems_usa' and `Chemical_usa.' Thanks to our law 
 enforcement partners, `Chems_usa' is now in U.S. prison." 
 Castro has agreed to forfeit $4,156,198.18 including the funds on those seven Bitcoin wallets.

Rochester Drug Company 
 Distributor Has Been Shipping Excess Opioids to Small Towns 
 Legal Reader 
 By Sara E. Teller 
 7/31/19 
 Miami -Luken Inc., an Ohio drug wholesale distributor, and four people including two former executives have 
 been charged with selling millions of pills amid the opioid epidemic despite knowing the dangers. The 
 indictment charged the Springboro, Ohio-based company; Anthony Rattini, the company's former president; 
 James Barlay, former compliance officer, and two pharmacists with "conspiring to distribute controlled 
 substances." Prosecutors have alleged "Miami-Luken ignored obvious signs that drugs were being diverted to 
 illegal users and dealers between 2011 and 2015." The company was shipping 4.9 million pills to Miller-West's 
 drugstore in Oceana, W.Va., where the population is just under 1,400. 
 "Miami -Luken and the executives failed to guard against the dangerous drugs it was shipping to pharmacies in 
 fi ve states from being diverted for illegal uses or to report suspicious orders to the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
 Administration," they added. 
 The distributor shipped millions of pills to desolate and rural areas of Appalachia which was hit especially hard 
 by the epidemic. "Records show Miami-Luken also distributed 3.7 million hydrocodone pills from 2008 to 2011 
 to a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 400 people," prosecutors said. The pharmacists charged 
 were Devonna Miller-West, the owner of Oceana, West Virginia's Westside Pharmacy, and Samuel Ballengee, 
 owner of Williamson, West Virginia's Tug Valley Pharmacy. 
 The company was also shipping some to other "unnamed pharmacists and physicians," the indictment alleged. 
 "There's a need, in my opinion, to devote sufficient charges right here and now to stop the dying," United States 
 Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman said, adding investigators found "many overdose deaths that could arguably be 
 linked to the conduct of people accused in the conspiracy." 
 In April of this year, criminal charges were brought against Rochester Drug Co-operative. Geoffrey S. Berman, 
 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ray Donovan, the Special Agent in 
 Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), announced the charges. 
 Rochester Drug Co-Operative is one of the 10 largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. Charges 
 were also filed against Laurence F. Doud III, the company's former chief executive officer; and William 
 Pietruszewski, the company's former chief compliance officer. The indictment was specifically for "unlawfully 
 distributing oxycodone and fentanyl, and conspiring to defraud the DEA," according to court documents. 
 Berman said at the time, "This prosecution is the first of its kind: executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and 
 the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the 
 opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country. Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this 
 epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms." The 
 company paid $20 million to resolve the charges. 
 DEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said, "Today's charges should send shock waves throughout the 
 pharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication. The distribution 
 of life-saving medication is paramount to public health; similarly, so is identifying rogue members of the 
 pharmaceutical and medical fields whose diversion contributes to the record-breaking drug overdoses in 
 America. DEA investigates DEA Registrants who divert controlled pharmaceutical medication into the wrong 
 hands for the wrong reason. This historic investigation unveiled a criminal element of denial in RDC's 
 compliance practices and holds them accountable for their egregious non-compliance according to the law."

 Life Spine 
 Lawsuit against Huntley-based medical device company alleges kickback scheme 
 Northwest Herald 
 By Drew Zimmerman 
 7/30/19 
 Life Spine, a medical technology manufacturer in Huntley, is the defendant in a federal lawsuit alleging 
 violations of the False Claims Act by offering lucrative incentives to surgeons in exchange for their use of Life 
 Spine products. 
 The suit, which was filed last week by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, alleges 
 that the company entered into agreements with dozens of surgeons as a means to pay more than $7 million in 
 illegal kickbacks — including consulting fees, royalties and intellectual acquisition payments - for the surgeon's 
 use of Life Spine's equipment. 
 The suit also alleges that these agreements, spanning an estimated seven-year period, were done with the 
 knowledge, involvement and participation of Life Spine President and CEO Michael Butler and Vice President 
 of Business Development Richard Greiber, who also are being charged. 
 "Defendants are liable for damages based on the payment of claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid for 
 medical services and procedures involving Life Spine Products that were tainted by illegal kickbacks," the suit 
 reads. 
 About half of Life Spine's total domestic sales of spinal products between January 2012 and at least December 
 2018, were attributable to surgeries performed by these paid surgeons, according to the suit. 
 In addition to the consulting fees and royalties being paid, surgeons also were treated to dinners at high-end 
 restaurants, Chicago Cubs games and other perks. 
 "As alleged, Life Spine and its senior management flagrantly ignored the law by paying surgeons millions of 
 dollars in fees and royalties to get them to use Life Spine products during spinal surgeries," Manhattan U.S. 
 Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a release. "Kickbacks to doctors can alter or compromise their judgment 
 about the medical care and services to provide to patients, and can increase healthcare costs." 
 For the first two counts of violating the False Claims Act — which are against Life Spine, Butler and Greiber —
 the plaintiff is seeking treble damages and civil penalties to the maximum amount allowed by state law. 
 For the third count of unjust enrichment — which is only against Life Spine — the plaintiff is seeking damages to 
 the extent allowed by law. 
 The plaintiff also is seeking pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and any other relief the court deems 
 appropriate. 
 A statement from Life Spine said that both parties are engaged in discussions and look forward to resolving the 
 matter.

Matters of Interest 
 The U.S. said a California cherry-picker went to Pakistan for terrorist training. Now the case has 
 collapsed. 
 Washington Post 
 By Meagan Flynn 
 7/31/19 
 It was a month after 9/11, and Osama bin Laden's face flashed across the news on Naseem Khan's TV screen. 
 The FBI was sitting in his living room in Bend, Ore., and Khan sensed an opportunity. The agents had come for 
 an entirely different purpose and were ready to leave — until Khan pointed at the screen and said he thought he 
 could help with something else. A few years ago, he said, he saw bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman al-
 Zawahiri, one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, at a mosque in the wine-country town of Lodi, Calif. 
 The agents perked up, intrigued by the possibility. Had they really just stumbled into a hot tip on al-Qaeda while 
 speaking to a 28-year-old McDonald's worker and convenience store clerk? The FBI thought Khan was onto 
 something — a possible "sleeper cell" of terrorism hidden in Lodi — and decided to dispatch him there as a 
 confidential informant. 
 Khan wouldn't find any associates of Zawahiri at the mosque in Lodi, and U.S. officials and terrorism experts 
 now doubt his initial claim about Zawahiri was ever true. But Khan would find 19-year-old Hamid Hayat — who 
 would soon become the face of homegrown terrorism in post-9/11 America. 
 They met at the mosque, and Khan learned Hayat was taking a trip to Pakistan with family. Over and over, in 
 recorded conversations, he returned to the same question: Would Hayat commit to attending a terrorist training 
 camp, as he had promised? 
 Now, a judge's order on Tuesday casts doubt on whether Hayat ever actually did. 
 Hayat, a cherry-picker and son of an ice cream truck driver, was convicted of attending the alleged terrorist 
 training camp and sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2006. Prosecutors, relying on Khan and Hayat's own 
 statements, alleged that he attended the camp for three to six months sometime in 2003. The case would become 
 one of the most high-profile examples of the government's fight against terrorism in the immediate aftermath of 
 9/11, especially because Hayat, after hours of interrogation by FBI agents, confessed to attending the camp. 
 But on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. vacated his conviction and sentence, finding that 
 Hayat had inadequate defense during the 2006 trial while casting doubt on the facts of the case. Burrell 
 questioned whether jurors would have convicted him had they heard evidence from witnesses in Pakistan, which 
 the judge said likely would have "undermined" jurors' confidence in Hayat's confession alone. His attorneys 
 have maintained the confession was coerced during an exhausting interrogation. 
 Had the defense attorney actually interviewed any witnesses in Pakistan who spent significant time with Hayat 
 during his trip, she would have discovered that they recalled Hayat spent most of his time playing video games 
 and cricket and that the purpose of his visit was for his family to find him a wife, according to Burrell's order. 
 No one identified any prolonged disappearance that would have allowed him to visit a terrorist training camp for 
 three to six months as prosecutors alleged and Hayat said in the confession, Burrell noted. Burrell, who oversaw 
 Hayat's original trial, found the witnesses gave consistent statements and could have provided Hayat a credible 
 alibi. 
 "Showing that Hayat could not have been at a jihadi training camp for the `period of months' specified in the 
 indictment would have been completely consistent with the defense that Hayat's confession should not be 
 EFTA00018461
credited and the government lacked other supporting evidence," a U.S. magistrate wrote in making the 
 recommendation that Hayat's conviction be vacated. Burrell adopted most of the magistrate's findings of fact. 
 The government has not decided yet whether to appeal the decision, a spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's office 
 in the Eastern District of California said in a statement, the Sacramento Bee reported. "We are in the process of 
 reviewing the district court decision and assessing what steps, if any, should be taken and considering all our 
 options," the statement said. 
 Hayat, now 36, is currently being held in a federal prison in Phoenix. His attorneys are seeking his immediate 
 release. 
 The case against Hayat and his father, Umer, who was accused of lying to the FBI, heaped international attention 
 on the Northern California town of Lodi. Seemingly overnight, the town went from the zinfandel capital of the 
 world to an alleged terrorism "sleeper cell" — a claim authorities would later walk back. 
 At the time he met Khan in August 2002, Hayat lived in his parents' garage and didn't have many friends, as the 
 Intercept recounted in a 2016 investigation. Posing as a radical Islamist, Khan nudged Hayat into conversations 
 that were anti-American and supportive of Islamic fundamentalist groups, and to his delight Hayat went along 
 with it, according to recorded conversations cited in federal court documents. Hayat approved of the beheading 
 of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl by Pakistani militants. He told Khan he believed jihadists had 
 attended his grandfather's religious school in Pakistan and claimed his grandfather was so politically well 
 connected that the Pakistani president enlisted him in efforts to persuade the Taliban to turn over bin Laden after 
 9/11. 
 Then came the terrorist camps. Hayat said he had seen one in an online video — and expressed interest in going 
 himself. Khan, feeding the intel to the FBI, egged him on. 
 But once in Pakistan, Hayat kept making excuses, according to the judge's order. When Khan told him he was 
 being "lazy," Hayat claimed the climate had changed and it got too hot outside — the terrorist camp was 
 canceled, he said. Khan was starting to get mad. His nudges turned to threats. 
 "God willing, when I come to Pakistan and I see you, I'm going to ... force you to, get you from your throat and 
 ... throw you in the madrassa," Khan said in one expletive-laden recorded conversation, as the Intercept reported. 
 "I'm not going to go with that," Hayat said. 
 "Oh yeah, you will go," Khan told him. "Yeah, you will go. You know what? Maybe I can't fight with you in 
 America, but I can beat your a-- in Pakistan, so nobody's going to come to your rescue." 
 In their last conversation, according to the Intercept, which obtained all the recordings, Hayat said he "never 
 intended on going to a camp." 
 Hayat denied attending a camp in his first interview with the FBI in Japan, before flying to San Francisco. He 
 confessed during his second interview in California upon his return in June 2005. 
 "FBI: Al Qaeda plot possibly uncovered," rang a CNN headline in June 2005, saying those involved "Trained on 
 how to kill Americans." 
 Months after Hayat's arrest, then-director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, testified in a 
 congressional hearing that a "network of Islamic extremists in Lodi, Calif., for example, maintained connections 
 with Pakistani militant groups, recruited United States citizens." 
 But ultimately, no other terrorism cases arose from the investigation except for the one against Hayat. Two 
 imams were investigated but were never criminally charged with anything. They had overstayed religious worker 
 EFTA00018462
visas, authorities discovered. 
 A retired FBI agent who watched Hayat's interrogation and the resulting confession told the Los Angeles Times 
 it was "the sorriest interrogation, the sorriest confession, I've ever seen," believing the agents fed Hayat the 
 details they wanted to hear and that Hayat repeated them so he could leave. He was barred from offering his 
 testimony at trial. Burrell found that the failure to challenge the validity of the confession by presenting a false 
 confession expert also contributed to his finding that Hayat had ineffective counsel. 
 Khan was ultimately paid nearly $230,000 for assisting the FBI over three years. During Hayat's trial, his 
 defense attorney questioned how one fast-food worker's implausible claim that he saw the world's most wanted 
 terrorist in a small-town mosque could have "sparked this whole investigation with this ridiculous claim," the 
 Times reported in 2006. 
 Hayat's attorneys filed an appeal in 2014 and ultimately sought to interview numerous witnesses in Pakistan who 
 could account for his whereabouts during the trip from 2003 to 2005. They appeared for sworn depositions on 
 video in 2018. When Hayat's attorney, Dennis Riordan, asked his uncle whether he "would have known" if 
 Hayat disappeared from their rural hamlet, Muhammad Anas said, "Naturally, I would have noticed," the 
 Marshall Project reported then. 
 The judge found that the witnesses "corroborated each other on some important points," regarding trips the 
 family took throughout Pakistan and who they visited. Once or twice a month, they traveled to a hospital for his 
 mother's medical treatment. 
 On Tuesday, Hayat's family issued a statement applauding the judge's decision to throw out Hayat's conviction, 
 the Sacramento Bee reported. 
 "We have been waiting 14 long years for Hamid to be freed," the statement read. "Hamid cannot get those 14 
 years of his life back, but we are relieved to see the case take such a big step forward. We miss him and hope to 
 be reunited with him soon." 
 Fed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time Since 2008 Crisis 
 New York Times 
 By Jeanna Smialek 
 7/31/19 
 The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday as it attempted to 
 guard the record-long economic expansion against mounting global risks. 
 The widely expected quarter-point move, the Fed's first since it cut rates to near zero in 2008, is meant to protect 
 the economy against the potentially harmful effects of a growth slowdown in China and Europe and uncertainty 
 from President Trump's trade war. 
 "In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation 
 pressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," according to the Federal 
 Open Market Committee's policy statement. 
 But the Fed did not indicate that this was the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign, suggesting instead that the 
 cut was a minor adjustment intended to help the economy weather any challenges from slowing global growth 
 and Mr. Trump's trade fights.

 Sundays. 
 While Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, left the door open to additional rate moves if the economy showed signs 
 of sputtering, he did not indicate the central bank was poised to engage in the sort of deep cutting cycle that the 
 Fed has done in the past to avert or offset recessions. 
 "It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts - I didn't say it's just one," Mr. Powell said at a news 
 conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. "What we're seeing is that it's appropriate to adjust 
 policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that's how we're looking at it." 
 The widely expected move from the central bank was initially greeted with a shrug in financial markets, where 
 investors have been factoring in a rate cut for months. But the stock market turned lower after Mr. Powell began 
 his news conference at 2:30 p.m., as investors absorbed the chair's comments as indicating the Fed was unlikely 
 to make additional cuts anytime soon, as investors had hoped. 
 By the end of the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent. It was the benchmark index's worst decline since May 
 31. 
 The Fed dropped its target rate to a range between 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Officials also announced an early 
 end to its efforts to shrink the Fed's balance sheet, another attempt to keep the economy moving. The central 
 bank's holdings of government-backed bonds swelled during the financial crisis as it bought assets to try to 
 reinvigorate growth. Policymakers have been slowly siphoning off securities to return their balance sheet to a 
 more normal size, and that process was slated to end in September. It will now conclude Aug. 1. 
 Why the Federal Reserve Cut Interest Rates 
 The move is what's called an "insurance cut" — one that central bankers are making to keep growth chugging 
 along. 
 Both Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Esther George, the president of 
 the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against Wednesday's decision, preferring instead to leave rates 
 unchanged. Those dissents marked the second and third of Jerome H. Powell's term as chair. 
 While Fed officials said they expect economic expansion to continue and the labor market to remain strong 
 "uncertainties about this outlook remain." 
 Mr. Powell said the Fed's move was "intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and 
 trade tensions." 
 He said that manufacturing around the world was weakening and that Mr. Trump's trade dispute was continuing 
 to spook American businesses. "The ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their 
 capital spending," he said. 
 Officials did not indicate in their statement whether this cut would be followed by additional moves. The Fed's 
 June economic projections suggest policymakers envision cutting rates slightly to shore up the economy, rather 
 than beginning an easing cycle that will return rates to zero. 
 "As the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
 monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain 
 the expansion," the Fed said in its statement, seemingly leaving its options open. 
 Mr. Powell said the committee viewed the move as a "mid-cycle adjustment to policy," suggesting that the Fed 
 sees this cut as more similar to two instances in the 1990s, during which the Fed moved rates down slightly to 
 get the economy through periods of uncertainty, rather than the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign. 
 EFTA00018464
The Fed's rate cut carries political risks, given Mr. Trump's attacks on the central bank. Mr. Trump has been 
 denouncing the Fed in speeches and on Twitter for the past year, criticizing its four 2018 rate increases and 
 blaming its policies for slowing the American economy. Some onlookers may see Wednesday's move as caving 
 to the president. 
 The Fed operates independently of the White House. It attributed the change, which officials have been signaling 
 for months and which investors fully expected, to growing economic concerns. 
 "We also don't conduct monetary policy to prove our independence," Mr. Powell said. 
 The central bank is trying to extend a record-long economic expansion, because officials believe that doing so 
 will allow the Fed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and slow but steady inflation. The 
 unemployment rate is hovering around its lowest level in 50 years, but that has yet to push wages dramatically 
 higher in a way that forces companies to lift prices more quickly. 
 Inflation has run shy of the Fed's 2 percent goal since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012. A little 
 inflation helps to grease the wheels of a healthy economy, allowing businesses to raise wages faster and lifting 
 interest rates, giving the central bank more room to cut in the event of a downturn. 
 Prices picked up just 1.6 percent in the year through June, not counting volatile food and fuel costs. 
 Wages are growing only moderately. An index of employment costs climbed by 2.7 percent in the second quarter 
 from a year earlier, less than expected and a slowdown from earlier in 2019, according to data released on 
 Wednesday. 
 Global policy uncertainty has also increased, and manufacturing is slumping the world over. Growth is slowing 
 in China and Europe, and Mr. Trump's trade war with China and threats of further tariffs on United States trading 
 partners are stoking uncertainty and causing businesses to hold off on investment. 
 Those developments threaten the economic outlook, even as growth remains solid, consumer spending is robust 
 and the job market holds up for now.

 continue to evaluate where the defendant should be housed within the facility and that the 
 defendant will be placed into the general population if and when BOP is assured that such 
 placement would not pose a threat to the orderly operation of the institution. The defendant 
 identifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that, 
 as detailed below, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery 
 in this case. 
 Regarding the defendant's request in connection with access to discovery, the Government 
 understands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government's 
 first discovery production at the time the Defense Letter was filed—she received the materials on 
 Tuesday, August II. While it is correct that GOP's initial plan was to provide three hours per day 
 of access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including 
 those with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2021-as of earlier this week, and given 
 the volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity 
 to access to her discovery from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day of the week. Although this 
 arrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and 
 is subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on 
 an ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this 
 application should be denied as moot. 
 C. Conclusion 
 For the reasons set forth above, the defendants' requests, as set forth in the Defense Letter, 
 should be denied.

 Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA 
 New York Times 
 By James B. Stewart, Matthew Goldstein and Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 7/31/19 
 Jeffrey E. Epstein, the wealthy financier who is accused of sex trafficking, had an unusual dream: He hoped to 
 seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch. 
 Mr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar 
 with his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition. 
 Mr. Epstein's vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the 
 science of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial 
 intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of 
 improving the human race through controlled breeding. 
 Mr. Epstein, who was charged in July with the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14, was a serial illusionist: 
 He lied about the identities of his clients, his wealth, his financial prowess, his personal achievements. But he 
 managed to use connections and charisma to cultivate valuable relationships with business and political leaders. 
 Interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the 
 same tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in 
 eugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics. 
 Lawyers for Mr. Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking charges, did not respond to requests 
 for comment. 
 Mr. Epstein attracted a glittering array of prominent scientists. They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist 
 Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen 
 Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and 
 best-selling author; George M. Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be 
 altered to create superior humans; and the M.I.T. theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate. 
 The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some 
 of the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, 
 and even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. 
 Scientists gathered at dinner parties at Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion, where Dom Perignon and expensive 
 wines flowed freely, even though Mr. Epstein did not drink. He hosted buffet lunches at Harvard's Program for 
 Evolutionary Dynamics, which he had helped start with a $6.5 million donation.

 Others flew to conferences sponsored by Mr. Epstein in the United States Virgin Islands and were feted on his 
 private island there. Once, the scientists — including Mr. Hawking — crowded on board a submarine that Mr. 
 Epstein had chartered. 
 The Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker said he was invited by colleagues — including Martin 
 Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and biology, and the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss — to 
 "salons and coffee klatsches" at which Mr. Epstein would hold court. 
 While some of Mr. Pinker's peers hailed Mr. Epstein as brilliant, Mr. Pinker described him as an "intellectual 
 impostor." 
 "He would abruptly change the subject, A.D.D.-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack," 
 Mr. Pinker said. 
 Another scientist cultivated by Mr. Epstein, Jaron Lanier, a prolific author who is a founding father of virtual 
 reality, said that Mr. Epstein's ideas did not amount to science, in that they did not lend themselves to rigorous 
 proof. Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace. 
 Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. 
 Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor. 
 Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was 
 bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you. 
 At one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor 
 because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had 
 rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have 
 more children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been 
 "voted off the island" and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein's gatherings. 
 Then there was Mr. Epstein's interest in eugenics. 
 On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his 
 ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and 
 would give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and 
 wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it. 
 It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a 
 gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. 
 One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other 
 recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin 
 Islands. 
 The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the 
 law. 
 Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a 
 scientist who told him that Mr. Epstein's goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-
 3 
 EFTA00018468
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 square -foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as 
 working at NASA, but he did not remember her name. 
 According to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts 
 of the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted 
 to strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. 
 The repository discontinued operations in 1999.) 
 Mr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the 
 dinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen 
 candidates to bear Mr. Epstein's children. 
 Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA. 
 One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier's interest in cryonics, an 
 unproven science in which people's bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told 
 this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen. 
 Southern Trust Company, Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island-incorporated business, disclosed in a local filing that it 
 was engaged in DNA analysis. Calls to Southern Trust, which sponsored a science and math fair for school 
 children in the Virgin Islands in 2014, were not returned. 
 In 2011, a charity established by Mr. Epstein gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, which 
 now operates under the name Humanity Plus. The group's website says that its goal is "to deeply influence a 
 new generation of thinkers who dare to envision humanity's next steps." 
 Mr. Epstein's foundation, which is now defunct, also gave $100,000 to pay the salary of Ben Goertzel, vice 
 chairman of Humanity Plus, according to Mr. Goertzel's résumé. 
 "I have no desire to talk about Epstein right now," Mr. Goertzel said in an email to The New York Times. "The 
 stuff I'm reading about him in the papers is pretty disturbing and goes way beyond what I thought his misdoings 
 and kinks were. Yecch." 
 Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of law at Harvard, recalled that at a lunch Mr. Epstein hosted in 
 Cambridge, Mass., he steered the conversation toward the question of how humans could be improved 
 genetically. Mr. Dershowitz said he was appalled, given the Nazis' use of eugenics to justify their genocidal 
 effort to purify the Aryan race. 
 Yet the lunches persisted. 
 "Everyone speculated about whether these scientists were more interested in his views or more interested in his 
 money," said Mr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein's defense lawyers in the 2008 case. 
 Luminaries at Mr. Epstein's St. Thomas conference in 2006 included Mr. Hawking and the Caltech theoretical 
 physicist Kip S. Thorne. One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, 
 recalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome. Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated 
 with how certain traits were passed on, and how that could result in superior humans.

 Mr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through John Brockman, a literary 
 agent whose best-selling science writers include Richard Dawkins, Daniel Goleman and Jared Diamond. Mr. 
 Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. 
 For two decades, Mr. Brockman presided over a series of salons that matched his scientist-authors with 
 potential benefactors. (The so-called "billionaires' dinners" apparently became a model for the gatherings at Mr. 
 Epstein's East 71st Street townhouse, which included some of the same guests.) 
 In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif, where Mr. Epstein 
 was introduced to scientists, including Seth Lloyd, the M.I.T. physicist. Mr. Lloyd said that he found Mr. 
 Epstein to be "charming" and to have "interesting ideas," although they "turned out to be quite vague." 
 Also at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockman's Edge Foundation, 
 were the Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos, who was accompanied by his mother. 
 "All the good-looking women were sitting with the physicists' table," Daniel Dubno, who was a CBS producer 
 at the time and attended the dinner, was quoted as saying. Mr. Dubno told The Times that he did not recall the 
 dinner or having said those words. 
 Mr. Brockman was Mr. Gell-Mann's agent, and Mr. Gell-Mann, in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 
 book "The Quark and the Jaguar," thanked Mr. Epstein for his financial support. 
 However impressive his roster of scientific contacts, Mr. Epstein could not resist embellishing it. He claimed on 
 one of his websites to have had "the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists," including Mr. Pinker, 
 Mr. Thome and the M.I.T. mathematician and geneticist Eric S. Lander. 
 Mr. Pinker said he had never taken any financial or other support from Mr. Epstein. "Needless to say, I find 
 Epstein's behavior reprehensible," he said. 
 Mr. Thome, who recently won a Nobel Prize, said he attended Mr. Epstein's 2006 conference, believing it to be 
 co -sponsored by a reputable research center. Other than that, "I have had no contact with, relationship with, 
 affiliation with or funding from Epstein," he said. "I unequivocally condemn his abhorrent actions involving 
 minors." 
 Lee McGuire, a spokesman for Mr. Lander, said he has had no relationship with Mr. Epstein. "Mr. Epstein 
 appears to have made up lots of things," Mr. McGuire said, "and this seems to be among them."

 Some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new charges in South Florida 
 South Florida Sun Sentinel 
 By Marc Freeman 
 7/30/19 
 Financier Jeffrey Epstein has been branded a pervert and an abuser, but not all of his victims want to see him 
 prosecuted further in South Florida. 
 Some of the girls Epstein assaulted at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 have already reached financial 
 settlements with him and fear they'll lose their anonymity. Federal prosecutors — the ones who approved his 
 lenient plea deal to begin with — say they fully support that position. 
 Epstein faces separate federal sex trafficking charges in New York, but the debate about prosecuting him in 
 South Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West Palm Beach is considering whether to 
 strike down parts of a controversial 2007 deal that gave him and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from 
 federal charges. 
 U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement violated the 
 federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark about it until after it had 
 been finalized. 
 Marra must decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for two 
 of Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. 
 The victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are 
 long overdue charges in Florida. 
 "To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New 
 York," their lawyers wrote. "But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's 
 crimes in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large." 
 Lawyers for the U.S. government disagree. 
 They concede that prosecutors back then "fell short" of treating victims properly as they reached a settlement 
 with Epstein. But the attorneys now contend "the past cannot be undone" and the deal must be upheld under the 
 law. 
 Among their arguments is that many victims clearly want to let it go, because they are content with financial 
 settlements they obtained from Epstein, and his 2008 guilty plea to two state prostitution charges. That plea 
 resulted in 13 months in Palm Beach County Jail and registering as a sex offender. 
 The prosecutors say they reached this position based on "conversations" with the victims and their lawyers, 
 without giving a specific number. 
 Attorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's 
 Office in April. 
 6 
 EFTA00018471
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 "She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail," Kuvin said. "She said, `I don't know if that's a 
 realistic possibility, but that's what I want.'" 
 He said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. 
 "When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be 
 handled," Kuvin said. "But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come 
 forward ... is enough to put him away." 
 The federal prosecutors explained that while some victims "would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, 
 they valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in 
 any criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or 
 the public." 
 This is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, 
 wrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. 
 Kitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. 
 But they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still "exacerbates the harm to 
 victims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim." 
 Kuvin said he agrees, "It's a valid concern for some of the victims." 
 Attorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's 
 reasoning to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. 
 Lawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to 
 prosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. 
 The lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the 
 prosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. 
 "The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no 
 credence from the Court," wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane 
 Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. 
 They also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged "risk" to some victims outweighs 
 obtaining justice for their clients. 
 "But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous," they wrote this 
 month. 
 Epstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal 
 shouldn't be blown up to allow new charges. 
 Jeffrey Epstein faces `a million pages' of evidence: defense lawyer

 7/31/19 
 Prosecutors have 1 million pages of evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, his lawyer revealed in court Monday—
 without shedding any new light on the jailhouse incident that left the convicted pedophile with bruises on his 
 neck. 
 No marks were visible on Epstein's neck, and he never appeared to be in pain during the 15-minute hearing in 
 Manhattan federal court. 
 The judge overseeing the case tentatively scheduled Epstein's trial for June 2020 after a prosecutor said the 
 child sex-trafficking charges against him should be resolved as "swiftly as possible." 
 "We don't think any delay in this is in the public interest," Manhattan Assistant US Attorney said. 
 Epstein's trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and the defense will have all the prosecution's evidence 
 against the multimillionaire financier by Oct. 31, she said. 
 Defense lawyer Martin Weinberg objected to starting the trial before September 2020, saying, "We need time to 
 review a million pages of discovery." 
 But Judge Richard Berman said he was blocking out time in June 2020 on the presumption that the defense 
 would be ready by then. 
 Weinberg didn't make any mention of the July 23 incident in which law enforcement sources have said Epstein, 
 66, was found sprawled on the floor of his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he's being held 
 without bail. 
 Weinberg declined to answer questions about the incident outside court. 
 Epstein, who wore dark blue jail scrubs over a brown T-shirt, didn't speak during the hearing. 
 He's pleaded not guilty to accusations he sexually abused dozens of underage girls - some as young as 14 —
 in his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. 
 Berman set a Sept. 13 deadline for defense motions in the case, and Weinberg said he planned to seek dismissal 
 of a conspiracy charge on grounds of double jeopardy tied to allegations that underpinned a non-prosecution 
 agreement that Epstein struck in 2008 with then-Miami US Attorney Alex Acosta. 
 That deal was exposed last year in an award-winning series of stories by the Miami Herald, and controversy that 
 erupted following Epstein's July 6 arrest forced Acosta to resign as President Trump's labor secretary.

 Jeffrey Epstein appears in court for first time since reported jail injuries 
 The Guardian 
 By Victoria Bekiempis 
 7/31/19 
 Financier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in 
 his sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. 
 He wore dark blue jail scrubs during his brief appearance in Manhattan federal criminal court on Wednesday 
 morning, in a proceeding scheduled before the apparent incident behind bars last week. 
 There were no signs of injuries that had been reported at the time and he appeared well and more neatly 
 presented than at some previous hearings. 
 The Jeffrey Epstein scandal 
 His lawyers did not bring up the incident in court and refused to comment on the topic following the hearing, 
 which focused on scheduling issues. 
 Prosecutor asked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: "We don't think that any 
 delay in this case is in the public interest." 
 The Manhattan US attorney's office alleged earlier in July that Epstein "sexually exploited and abused dozens 
 of minor girls" from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. 
 The disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago. 
 Epstein has long been accused of sexually abusing underage girls. He also has purported connections to Donald 
 Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite circles, including for several years in a relationship 
 with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. 
 Epstein and the Miami US attorney's office, headed at the time by Alexander Acosta, brokered a plea deal in 
 2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 teenage girls. 
 Under this arrangement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than 
 if he had faced federal charges. The Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown exposed the secretive nature of this 
 agreement. Acosta resigned from his post as Trump's labor secretary following extensive criticism of the deal. 
 Epstein has unsuccessfully requested bail while awaiting trial. The 66-year-old, who registered as a sex offender 
 following the Florida case, had maintained through lawyers that he neither posed a danger nor risk of flight. 
 In rejecting Epstein's request, Judge Richard Berman said, "the government has established danger to others 
 and to the community by clear and convincing evidence", adding: "I doubt that any bail package can overcome 
 a danger to the community." 
 9 
 EFTA00018474
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 Epstein's lawyers are appealing against the decision, according to court filings. 
 Late last week, Judge Berman also ruled in favor of prosecutors' proposed protective order, which will keep 
 case materials relating to "the government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals" under wraps.

 Judge sets tentative date for Jeffrey Epstein's trial 
 Associated Press 
 By Larry Neumeister and Jim Mustian 
 7/31/19 
 A subdued Jeffrey Epstein listened passively in court Wednesday as a judge said he won't face trial on sex 
 trafficking charges before June 2020, and more likely a few months afterward. 
 There was no mention at the Manhattan federal court appearance or any visible sign of injuries after the 66-
 year -old financier was found on the floor of his cell last week with neck bruises. 
 Epstein's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, refused to say what might have left his client with neck bruises after the 
 court hearing. 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney urged a June trial date for the man accused of arranging to have sex with 
 girls as young as age 14, saying there is "a public interest in bringing this case to trial as swiftly as possible." 
 But Weinberg said the case is far from "ordinary," adding the defense team won't be ready before Labor Day 
 2020. He said prosecutors delayed bringing charges that relate to alleged crimes that occurred in the early 2000s 
 at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Florida. 
 U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said a trial projected to last four to six weeks could tentatively begin 
 June 8, but he'll likely defer to defense lawyers' needs if they are not ready. 
 Epstein's demeanor in court was noticeably different from previous appearances, when he was actively engaged 
 with his lawyers and looking through papers. 
 On Wednesday, he sat quietly, his hands folded in front of his face through much of the 20-minute proceeding. 
 Occasionally, he looked toward courtroom artists and reporters seated in a jury box. 
 Epstein has remained at the Metropolitan Correction Center, which is adjacent to the downtown Manhattan 
 courthouse. 
 He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges that carry the potential for up to 45 years in prison. 
 Berman refused bail after concluding he is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Prosecutors have said 
 they fear he might try to influence a growing number of witnesses who support charges that he recruited and 
 abused dozens of girls in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. His lawyers had argued he should be 
 allowed to stay under house arrest in his Manhattan mansion. 
 His lawyers say an agreement reached with federal prosecutors a dozen years ago disallows the charges and 
 they say he has committed no new crimes.

 EFTA00018476
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 The lawyers agreed to file written arguments about the agreement and double jeopardy claims by Sept. 13. Oral 
 arguments will occur in October. 
 The non-prosecution deal was reached before he pleaded guilty in state court in Florida to prostitution-related 
 charges involving underage girls. Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to 
 many victims. While he served a 13-month jail term, he was permitted to leave jail to work for 12 hours a day, 
 six days a week. 
 Epstein was arrested July 6 when he arrived at a New Jersey airport on a private jet from Paris, where he has a 
 home.

 Did Jeffrey Epstein try to kill himself? He and his lawyer, back in court, aren't saying 
 Miami Herald 
 By Miami Herald Staff 
 7/31/19 
 Victims of Jeffrey Epstein share the emotional toll that sexual abuse has taken on them — even years after the 
 abuse occurred. Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown interviewed the young women, most speaking for the 
 first time about Epstein. BY EMILY MICHOT I JULIE K. BROWN 
 For the first time since he was found semi-conscious in his jail cell with telltale bruise marks on his neck, 
 accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein appeared in a Manhattan court room. 
 Epstein — onetime friend of the rich and powerful, including current President Donald Trump and past 
 President Bill Clinton — learned Wednesday that he will not face trial until at least next June. 
 The multimillionaire part-time resident of Palm Beach sat subdued in front of U.S. District Court Judge Richard 
 M. Berman. The 66-year-old defendant wore dark blue jail scrubs and glasses. 
 His lawyer, Martin Weinberg, declined to reveal any details about the incident at the Metropolitan Correctional 
 Center, which occurred July 23, including whether it was a suicide attempt, an attack by a fellow detainee or 
 something else. His client is being held without bond. 
 Wednesday's hearing in New York City lasted just 15 minutes. 
 Epstein, a financier who owns homes around the world, including a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, was 
 arrested July 6, nearly eight months after the Miami Herald published Perversion of Justice, a two-year 
 investigation of a much-reviled secret plea deal in 2007-2008 that spared Epstein a sweeping federal indictment 
 despite allegations of sexual abuse by nearly three dozen underage girls. 
 He had just arrived from France at New Jersey's Teterboro airport on his private jet when authorities met him 
 and took him into custody. 
 During the early- and mid-2000s, Epstein allegedly ran what amounted to a sexual pyramid scheme, using 
 recruiters to lure girls as young as 14 to his lavish Palm Beach and Manhattan mansions with the promise that 
 they would receive $200 to give a man a massage. The girls have alleged that they were coerced into sex. 
 The girls were paid additional money if they would recruit others girls, police and court records allege. Epstein 
 had assistants schedule as many as three visits a day. 
 Rather than face federal charges that could have put him away for life, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court to 
 minor prostitution charges and served just a year in the county stockade — which permitted him to leave the 
 lockup for his luxurious downtown West Palm Beach office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. This "work 
 release" arrangement, highly unusual for a sex offender, is now under criminal investigation by order of the 
 Palm Beach sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, who oversees the stockade and approved the work release.

SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 Although Assistant U.S. Attorney said it is important to move swiftly ahead with Epstein's court 
 case, his defense attorney said he needs time in light of the approximately one million pages of documents that 
 that comprise the evidence collected against his client. 
 Labor Secretary Alex Acosta held a press conference to defend his role in handling the Jeffrey Epstein sexual 
 abuse case. Acosta was a U.S. Attorney who approved the Epstein plea deal in 2008. By CSPAN 
 In the meantime, Epstein will be given a chance to argue that the non-prosecution agreement, executed in 2008, 
 gave him, his schedulers, his alleged madam and others immunity from federal charges and that the new 
 charges constitute impermissible double jeopardy. 
 In its series of articles, the Herald highlighted the role of Alexander Acosta, then-U.S. attorney for the Southern 
 District of Florida, in approving the immunity agreement, including a controversial stipulation that Epstein's 
 accusers not be told of the arrangement. Facing searing criticism after Epstein's arrest, Acosta resigned his post 
 as President Trump's labor secretary.

 Jeffrey Epstein could face sex trafficking trial next June 
 Reuters 
 7/31/19 
 Financier Jeffrey Epstein could go to trial on charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as 
 early as next June, though his lawyers told a court on Wednesday they may need more time. 
 At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors sought a June 2020 trial date, while a lawyer for Epstein 
 asked that it wait another three months. 
 The lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said Epstein and his legal team needed more time to review evidence, expected 
 to total more than 1 million pages. 
 U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tentatively set aside time for a trial beginning June 8, but 
 revisit the issue later. He said he normally allowed defendants more time to prepare if they wished. 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney said a trial is expected to last four to six weeks. 
 Prosecutors have accused Epstein of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude "massages" and 
 other sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others. Epstein has pleaded not guilty. 
 Wednesday's hearing occurred one week after Epstein was reportedly found unconscious and with neck injuries 
 in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan. 
 Epstein, dressed in blue jail scrubs, had no visible injuries on Wednesday. His lawyers declined to comment on 
 the reports after the hearing. 
 Epstein is appealing Berman's July 18 denial of his request to remain under house arrest in his $77 million 
 mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side while awaiting trial. 
 The charges against Epstein focus on alleged misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005. 
 They followed Epstein's 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges in Florida, in exchange for the Justice 
 Department's agreement not to prosecute him on similar charges. 
 Epstein served 13 months in jail and agreed to register as a sex offender under the 2008 agreement, which is 
 now widely considered too lenient. 
 His lawyers have argued this month that the agreement barred federal prosecutors in Manhattan from pursuing 
 the current case over the same conduct. Weinberg said at Wednesday's hearing that they intended to file 
 motions on the issue. 
 U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is overseeing the current case, has said there is no such bar.

 Epstein Lawyers Ask for a Year to Review a Million Pages 
 Bloomberg 
 By Chris Dolmetsch , Bob Van Voris , and Patricia Hurtado 
 7/31/19 
 Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a blizzard of documents prosecutors have 
 gathered against the fund manager as they prepare to defend him against charges of sex trafficking in minors 
 and conspiracy. 
 Prosecutors asked a judge to schedule Epstein's trial for next June, but defense attorney Martin Weinberg said 
 his team wanted to wait until September 2020, because they haven't yet begun to receive documents from the 
 government. 
 "We need time to receive a million pages of discovery and prepare to defend a four- to six-week trial," 
 Weinberg said during a brief hearing in Manhattan on Wednesday. "We need time to assess events that occurred 
 14 to 17 years ago." 
 The judge set a tentative trial date of June 8 and asked the parties to keep him updated on their progress. 
 Epstein, who didn't speak in court, was arrested on July 6 after stepping off his private plane in New Jersey 
 from a trip to Paris. He has pleaded not guilty and said he has fully complied with the law for more than 14 
 years. 
 Marks on Neck 
 Epstein is accused of molesting teenage girls from 2002 to 2005. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state 
 charges of soliciting prostitution, after striking a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Federal prosecutors 
 in New York say they are not bound by the deal as they now pursue their own charges. 
 In court Wednesday, there was no discussion of what happened to the 66-year-old Epstein last week at New 
 York's Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he has been held since his arrest. People familiar with the 
 matter said he was found injured and unresponsive in his cell, with marks on his neck. Authorities are 
 investigating whether he was assaulted, possibly by another inmate, or whether the injuries were self-inflicted. 
 Weinberg declined to respond to questions about the incident outside court. 
 Also in court was Gloria Allred, the activist lawyer who has represented women accusing Roy Moore, Bill 
 Cosby and President Donald Trump of sexual assault. After the hearing, she said she was representing other 
 Epstein accusers who "were not in the Florida case." She said other women have approached her about their 
 experiences with Epstein but were reluctant to discuss them for fear of retaliation. 
 The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, has urged others who may be victims to come forward and 
 cooperate with the government. Allred declined to say whether her clients have spoken to prosecutors. 
 The case is U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

 Collins 
 Editorial: Failures of ethics 
 Buffalo News 
 By News Editorial Board 
 7/29/19 
 The ethics specialists are right and so are the members of a special ethics panel, including both Democrats and 
 Republicans, who are paying attention. Good for them. The conduct of Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, exposed 
 a range of issues Congress needs to treat as tumors, and cut them out. 
 Collins was indicted last year on allegations of insider trading. But he was routinely smashing ethical standards 
 — of both formal and common sense varieties — before he was ever charged with a crime. 
 A year before Collins was indicted, the Office of Congressional Ethics reported that it found "a substantial 
 reason to believe" that Collins violated federal law by touting the stock of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an 
 Australian biotech firm, based on inside information. 
 The office also said Collins may have broken House ethics rules by persuading National Institutes of Health 
 officials to meet with a staffer from that company. 
 At least as troubling are the actions Collins took that were not deemed to be ethical violations. Speaking to a 
 bipartisan House task force charged with drawing up new ethics rules based on Collins' arrest, ethics experts 
 worried about lawmakers who sit on the boards of privately owned companies, or who serve as partners in other 
 businesses or who are directors of nonprofit organizations. Collins still does all three. 
 Earlier this year, in response to Collins' arrest, the House barred lawmakers from serving on the boards of 
 publicly traded companies. Collins did that, too, as a board member — and leading stockholder — of Innate 
 Immunotherapeutics. It's how prosecutors say he obtained the insider information that led to his arrest. 
 There was more. Collins authored a provision of the 2016 "21st Century Cures Act" that sped drug approval for 
 companies like Innate. Collins, with a straight face, claimed there was no conflict because Innate had no 
 business before U.S. regulators. But in 2017, the company practically beamed that it had "received clearance 
 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application 
 lodged last month." 
 The fact that Collins' role in the legislation could also have benefited other companies — and may even have 
 been worthy of passage — does nothing to change the associated fact that he was pushing for legislation whose 
 adoption could have lined his pockets. It was classic self-dealing. 
 The drug in question was meant to treat multiple sclerosis. It failed in clinical trials in 2017 and prosecutors say 
 Collins illegally spread the word to family and others who were able to sell their stock before its price collapsed 
 on the bad news. 
 Collins has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is scheduled for February. But regardless of what a judge 
 or jury ultimately decides about Collins, he has shown himself to be indifferent to the need for a member of 
 17 
 EFTA00018482
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 Congress to conduct himself in a way that reflects well on the institution and on the voters who entrust him with 
 public office. 
 In that, he has shown Congress that it needs to act. It can't count on its members using good judgment, 
 especially when millions of dollars are at stake. 
 The good news is that it seems ready to meet that public obligation. It is considering measures that would 
 prohibit lawmakers from serving as partners in limited liability corporations, joining committees that oversee 
 their business interests and serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations. Staff members would also be 
 barred. 
 Sadly, some Republican members have defended Collins, despite the clear conflicts of interest. But the 
 Republican on the ethics task force, Rep. Van Taylor of Texas, expressed no disagreement with the panel's 
 Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, who said she expected to move "rather quickly" on writing new 
 rules. 
 Taylor sees the tasks as "very narrow," focused on preventing lawmakers from serving in outside positions that 
 could pose conflicts. The remarkable thing is that those restrictions need to be put in writing. Thank Collins for 
 that.

 Securities and Commodities Fraud 
 Stewart 
 Southern District Will Pursue A Retrial Of "Silver Platter" Case 
 Forbes 
 By Walter Pavlo 
 7/30/19 
 Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading charges back in May 2015 during U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's 
 reign over the Southern District of New York. Now, over four years since his indictment, Sean can reflect back 
 on a wild journey of being convicted, sentenced to 3 years prison, having that conviction overturned, being 
 released from prison halfway through his term and, now, having a new date to go back to trial to face the 
 charges again. 
 Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading for passing material non-public information on potential deals to 
 his father, Robert, who then passed it on to his former friend and trader, Richard Cunniffe. Sean, a Yale 
 graduate who had worked in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase and Perella Weinberg, mentioned some 
 details about his work while talking to Robert. Sean's information made it to Cunniffe who made over a million 
 dollars on the trades, sharing a small amount (less $100,000) with Robert. How much did Sean make on the 
 trades? ZERO dollars. He had no idea that Cunniffe traded because he did not even know who Cunniffe was. 
 It was a clear case of misappropriation where information was used without Sean's knowledge, so it was not a 
 "classical" insider trading case. However, Bharara's team of U.S. attorneys was looking for cases that targeted 
 wealthy Wall Street traders who seemed to have an advantage over the average trader. Sean's case was a good 
 fit. 
 Cunniffe was busted by the FBI and soon became a government informant, taping calls and other meetings with 
 Robert. In one of those calls, Robert stated that Sean said of the information he had passed on to Cunniffe, "I 
 can't believe it. I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest." So the primary evidence in the case, 
 the case that came to be known as the "silver platter" case, was based on a statement that was attributed to Sean. 
 It's a phrase that Sean's new defense team wants to be excluded from the proceedings. 
 When Robert was arrested, under duress of FBI questioning, he said nine (9) times that Sean was not in on his 
 scheme with Cunniffe (here is entire tape transcript here). Robert also admitted his own role and that of 
 Cunniffe's during the interrogation. When it came to trial, neither that tape nor Robert's testimony was allowed 
 because of legal maneuvering by prosecutors. The video tape was suppressed and Robert did not testify due to 
 threats from prosecutors that he would be charged for peijury due to his conflicting accounts. Here is what the 
 jury missed from that tape: 
 FBI AGENT: Tell me about the first time that Sean gave you information on a deal. 
 ROBERT STEWART: Well, uh, I wouldn't characterize any of these as — I mean Sean would mention stuff. 
 I don't think he had any idea that I would trade on any of this stuff. Uh, I've never mentioned that I did, to him. 
 Ummm 
 19 
 EFTA00018484
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 AGENT: If that's true, how do you explain the comment you made to Rick [Cunniffe] that Sean got angry with 
 you when he gave you this information on a silver platter and you didn't invest. 
 ROBERT: Uhh, I think I was just saying that to Rick because Sean said, oh, you know, ahh, all these deals, you 
 know, you — if you were trading you could make like millions of dollars. And I said, you know, Sean, no 
 one's going to trade and make millions of dollars on this stuff. That wasn't his intention. 
 Robert took the 5th but did submit an affidavit that if he were to testify he would have said Sean did not know 
 about the trades by Cunniffe. 
 Looking back at the trial, there was not a single email, document, or text message that suggested that Sean was 
 a knowingly participated in the trading scheme. This is interesting since there were so many incriminating 
 documents between Cunniffe and Robert. There were no witnesses who gave testimony on Sean's knowledge 
 and intent, including Cunniffe, the cooperator, who on the stand acknowledged that he never knew Sean. 
 Furtnermore, trading records and actions undertaken by Sean suggest he did not know trading had taken place. 
 Last fall, the 2nd Circuit overturned Sean's conviction, something rare in most cases, especially a reversal on an 
 evidentiary ruling, which suggests the 2nd Circuit felt that Sean may be innocent and the judge's mistakes 
 resulted in an unfair trial. The appellate court ruled that Robert's post-arrest video interrogation should have 
 been allowed. Sean was released from prison and has been in legal limbo until the SDNY decided that they 
 would move to move forward with another trial on the same charges. 
 Stewart will have a new judge this time around. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain was replaced by Judge 
 Rakoff, a man who seems to be on a mission to define insider trading laws himself. He also has new attorneys 
 Steven M. Witzel, Lawrence Gerschwer, R. David Gallo and Leigh G. Rome of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & 
 Jacobson LLP. 
 If Sean is found guilty, he would face the prospect of being sentenced to prison and returning to prison to 
 complete a term. On the other hand, it would not be out of the question for Judge Rakoff to give him "time 
 served" in prison even if Sean is found guilty. Rakoff, not a fan of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, seems to 
 be one of those judges that uses common sense in his approach to sentencing. Earlier this week, Rakoff 
 sentenced a man to 14 months in prison for knowingly leaking insider information on Sherwin Williams' 
 acquisition of Valspar. 
 While Sean may have made some mistakes, these could have been handled by the companies he worked for 
 and, at the most severe, an enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SDNY seems 
 intent on trying to interpret insider trading laws by putting on elaborate trials with the threat of putting people in 
 prison for years. It is a waste of resources. 
 It looks like the ghost of Bharara still haunts the SDNY.

 Thompson 
 Easton man accused of stealing $7M via fake Bitcoin transactions 
 Lehigh Valley Live 
 By Sarah Cassi 
 7/30/19 
 An Easton man who headed a cryptocurrency escrow company was arrested last week on federal charges he 
 allegedly stole $7 million from two companies by lying about Bitcoin transactions. 
 Jon Barry Thompson, also known as J. Barry Thompson, was the principal of Volantis, which included a 
 cryptocurrency escrow company called Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and a related company, Volantis Market 
 Making LCC. 
 The 48-year-old Thompson was arrested in Easton, and was charged with two counts each of commodities fraud 
 and wire fraud. Easton police assisted in serving the arrest warrant at 6:15 a.m. Thursday at Thompson's West 
 Burke Street home on College Hill. 
 What happens to the money when a criminal's stash is in bitcoin? 
 When a criminal's stash is in bitcoin, the stakes are now much higher in forfeiture cases with the soaring value 
 of the virtual currency. 
 Thompson was released after posting $500,000 bond. Messages left for comment at a phone number listed for 
 Thompson and for his defense attorney, Matthew Siembieda, were not immediately returned. 
 Prosecutors said Thompson stole $7 million from two companies after lying about transactions of the peer-to-
 peer digital currency Bitcoin -- $3 million from one company and $4 million from a second. 
 Thompson offered minimized settlement default risk in cryptocurrency transactions, and claimed there was no 
 risk of default, prosecutors allege. 
 In June and July 2018, Thompson convinced the first company to send Volantis more than $3 million for a 
 Bitcoin purchase, prosecutors allege. Thompson allegedly assured the company he had the Bitcoin in hand and 
 that money could not be lost. 
 Thompson took the money, but never provided the company the promised Bitcoin or returned its money, 
 prosecutors said. 
 Thompson allegedly gave the company a fake account statement showing he had the company's money but in 
 reality sent the more than $3 million to a third-party entity purportedly in exchange for Bitcoin without first 
 receiving any of the Bitcoin in hand. 
 In July 2018, Thompson allegedly convinced a second company to send Volantis more than $4 million for 
 Bitcoin purchases. Again, Thompson is accused of sending a substantial portion of the money to a third party 
 without first receiving any Bitcoin in return, prosecutors allege. 
 21 
 EFTA00018486
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 Thompson never gave the second company any Bitcoin and did not return its money, prosecutors said. 
 "Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis 
 Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase," 
 Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a news release. "As his clients soon realized, however, 
 Thompson's representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they 
 had entrusted with him because of his lies." 
 FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney said Thompson used phrases and terminology that the victimized 
 companies didn't understand, and he "allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency." 
 "Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest 
 in Bitcoin," Sweeney said. 
 The complaint doesn't identify the companies allegedly victimized by Thompson. 
 Forbes previously reported Symphony, an Irish investment company that specializes in trading 
 cryptocurrencies, gave Thompson 3.6 million Euros to purchase Bitcoin on its behalf. 
 Symphony never received any Bitcoin and its money was never returned. 
 In that case, the plaintiff withdrew the complaint it had brought in federal court in Pennsylvania and, instead, 
 reached a private settlement with Thompson. Thompson then breached the agreement by failing to make the 
 first settlement payment, Forbes reported.

 Pinto-Thomaz 
 Popular Paint Brand Insider Trading, Results In Prison Term: Feds 
 Patch 
 By Chris Dehnel 
 7/30/19 
 A former analyst for a major financial ratings agency is to spend more than a year in prison for an insider 
 trading scheme involving his hairdresser, a jeweler and two major paint brands sold prominently in Connecticut. 
 Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the southern district of New York, announced that 
 Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz, 34, a former credit ratings analyst at Standard & Poor's, was sentenced in Manhattan 
 federal court to 14 months in prison for participating in two schemes to trade on material, nonpublic information 
 in advance of the Sherwin-Williams Company's acquisition of the Valspar Corporation. 
 Valspar is the brand sold by Lowe's. 
 Pinto-Thomaz was convicted on April 26, following a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who 
 also imposed Monday's sentence. 
 In summarizing the case, Berman said, "As an employee of Standard & Poor's, Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz was 
 privy to potentially lucrative information about business acquisition plans. Instead of protecting that 
 information, as he had sworn to do, he shared it with a friend and with his hairdresser. In turn, they bet on a 
 stock that they knew to be a sure thing, and raked in nearly $300,000 in profits. Pinto-Thomaz painted himself 
 into a corner when he and his co-defendants exploited insider information to reap illegal profits. Now they all 
 face time in prison for their misdeeds." 
 When a company announces an acquisition, the acquiring company often seeks the opinion of a credit rating 
 agency regarding the potential impact that the acquisition could have on the acquiring company's 
 creditworthiness, Berman said. Therefore, companies often contact rating agencies before an acquisition is 
 publicly announced in order to secure the rating agency's views on how a possible acquisition could impact a 
 company's credit rating, he said. 
 All major rating agencies offer a service — sometimes known as a Rating Evaluation Service, or RES — that 
 provides the company with a rating committee decision with respect to a proposed acquisition. 
 In March 2016, Standard and Poor's, a credit rating agency in New York, assigned Pinto-Thomazto work on a 
 RES for the Sherwin-Williams Company in advance of its contemplated but unannounced acquisition of the 
 Valspar Corporation, according to casae records. 
 In connection with the assignment, Pinto-Thomaz received material, nonpublic or "inside" information the deal 
 about Sherwin-Williams's planned acquisition of Valspar prior to the public announcement of the acquisition. 
 S&P's written policies prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which included the 
 inside information, Berman said. 
 During his tenure at S&P, Pinto-Thomaz reviewed and certified his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to S&P 
 and its clients, according to case records. 
 23 
 EFTA00018488
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 In March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz passed the inside information about the paint merger to Jeremy Millul, a friend, 
 and to Abell Oujaddou, his hairdresser, so that they could "use it to make profitable trades in Valspar stock and 
 options.," Berman said. 
 On March 21, 2016, the first trading day after the public announcement of the acquisition, the price of Valspar 
 stock increased approximately 23 percent over the prior day's close. 
 Millul, a Manhattan jeweler opened a brokerage account on March 13, 2016, and shortly thereafter purchased 
 480 shares of Valspar common stock, case records show. On March 18, 2016, the last trading day before the 
 acquisition was publicly announced, Millul also purchased 75 out-of-the-money Valspar call options, according 
 to case records. 
 After the acquisition was publicly announced, Millul sold his Valspar stock and options for approximately 
 $106,806 in profits, Berman said. 
 Oujaddou, a Manhattan hairstylist and salon owner who has known Pinto-Thomaz for years and is a close friend 
 with his mother, was given inside information during a haircut on March 8 or 9, 2016, according to case 
 records. On March 10 through March 18, 2016, Oujaddou, who had never previously purchased Valspar or 
 Sherwin-Williams purchased 8,630 shares of Valspar stock, case records show. 
 After the acquisition was publicly announced, Oujaddou sold his Valspar shares for approximately $192,080 in 
 profits, according to case records. 
 Following the trading, Oujaddou met Pinto-Thomaz in the paint aisle of a hardware store and paid him a 
 kickback, Berman said. 
 Pinto-Thomaz denied having a relationship with anyone on the list of pre-merger trading. 
 In addition to his prison term, Pinto-Thomaz was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to 
 pay a fine of $15,000 and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $7,500. 
 Millul and Oujaddou each previously pled guilty and were to be sentenced on July 30.

 Narcotics 
 Castro 
 Drug Dealer Forfeits Over $4M in Bitcoin as Part of a Guilt) Plea 
 All Stocks 
 By Ravi Rd 
 7/31/19 
 According to a July 25 press release from the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New 
 York, the very active Bitcoin drug dealer Richard Castro has pleaded guilty of committing illicit activities such 
 as money laundering and distributing three controlled substances through the dark web and encrypted emails. 
 Castro was charged by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and agreed to forfeit more than $4 million including 
 cryptocurrency funds available in his seven different Bitcoin wallets. 
 Castro, 36-year-old based in Windermere, Florida, operated under multiple badges, such as "Chems_usa," 
 "Chemical_usa" and "Jagger109" to distribute three controlled opioid substances namely carfentanil, fentanyl, 
 and phenyl fentanyl. Dream Market and AlphaBay were two of his primary market places on the dark web, 
 where he sold drugs in exchange for cryptocurrency. 
 The three controlled opioid substances were sold from November 2015 to 2019 by Castro and another co-
 conspirator, Luis Fernandez. Fentanyl, the first of these three is considered to be significantly stronger than 
 heroin while Carfentanil is believed to be 100 times stronger than fentanyl. Castro sold these substances under 
 the three aforementioned monikers which ultimately used to prove that he is indeed the leader of this 
 conspiracy. 
 On Dream Market, Castro once boasted about 3,200 transactions that he had completed on various dark web 
 marketplaces. Out of these 3,200 transactions, 1,800 transactions were successfully completed on AlphaBay 
 alone. The conspirators apparently also received many positive reviews for the quality of synthetic opioid 
 substance they were selling. 
 In June 218, Castro informed his clients that he would only accept orders received by encrypted emails and 
 declared the organization is getting the business off from the dark web. Customers who wanted to buy narcotics 
 had to acquire the address of the encrypted email from "Chems_usa" by paying certain fees. Unfortunately for 
 Castro, an undercover law enforcement officer also obtained the encrypted email and placed an order, which 
 ultimately led to his arrest. 
 Castro was accepting the payments in Bitcoin which were later distributed in seven different BTC wallets. 
 Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: 
 "As he admitted today, for years, Richard Castro used the dark web to distribute prolific quantities of powerful 
 opioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil. Castro thought he could hide behind the anonymity of the intemet, 
 and use online pseudonyms to deal drugs — like thems_usa' and `Chemical_usa.' Thanks to our law 
 enforcement partners, thems_usa' is now in U.S. prison."

 Rochester Drug Company 
 Distributor Has Been Shipping Excess Opioids to Small Towns 
 Legal Reader 
 By Sara E. Teller 
 7/31/19 
 Miami -Luken Inc., an Ohio drug wholesale distributor, and four people including two former executives have 
 been charged with selling millions of pills amid the opioid epidemic despite knowing the dangers. The 
 indictment charged the Springboro, Ohio-based company; Anthony Rattini, the company's former president; 
 James Barlay, former compliance officer, and two pharmacists with "conspiring to distribute controlled 
 substances." Prosecutors have alleged "Miami-Luken ignored obvious signs that drugs were being diverted to 
 illegal users and dealers between 2011 and 2015." The company was shipping 4.9 million pills to Miller-
 West's drugstore in Oceana, W.Va., where the population is just under 1,400. 
 "Miami -Luken and the executives failed to guard against the dangerous drugs it was shipping to pharmacies in 
 five states from being diverted for illegal uses or to report suspicious orders to the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
 Administration," they added. 
 The distributor shipped millions of pills to desolate and rural areas of Appalachia which was hit especially hard 
 by the epidemic. "Records show Miami-Luken also distributed 3.7 million hydrocodone pills from 2008 to 
 2011 to a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 400 people," prosecutors said. The pharmacists 
 charged were Devonna Miller-West, the owner of Oceana, West Virginia's Westside Pharmacy, and Samuel 
 Ballengee, owner of Williamson, West Virginia's Tug Valley Pharmacy. 
 The company was also shipping some to other "unnamed pharmacists and physicians," the indictment alleged. 
 "There's a need, in my opinion, to devote sufficient charges right here and now to stop the dying," United States 
 Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman said, adding investigators found "many overdose deaths that could arguably be 
 linked to the conduct of people accused in the conspiracy." 
 In April of this year, criminal charges were brought against Rochester Drug Co-operative. Geoffrey S. Berman, 
 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ray Donovan, the Special Agent in 
 Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), announced the 
 charges. Rochester Drug Co-Operative is one of the 10 largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. 
 Charges were also filed against Laurence F. Doud III, the company's former chief executive officer; and 
 William Pietruszewski, the company's former chief compliance officer. The indictment was specifically for 
 "unlawfully distributing oxycodone and fentanyl, and conspiring to defraud the DEA," according to court 
 documents. 
 Berman said at the time, "This prosecution is the first of its kind: executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and 
 the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the 
 opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country. Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this 
 epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms." The 
 company paid $20 million to resolve the charges.

 EFTA00018492
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 DEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said, "Today's charges should send shock waves throughout the 
 pharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication. The 
 distribution of life-saving medication is paramount to public health; similarly, so is identifying rogue members 
 of the pharmaceutical and medical fields whose diversion contributes to the record-breaking drug overdoses in 
 America. DEA investigates DEA Registrants who divert controlled pharmaceutical medication into the wrong 
 hands for the wrong reason. This historic investigation unveiled a criminal element of denial in RDC's 
 compliance practices and holds them accountable for their egregious non-compliance according to the law."

 Civil 
 Life Spine 
 Lawsuit against Huntley-based medical device company alleges kickback scheme 
 Northwest Herald 
 By Drew Zimmerman 
 7/30/19 
 Life Spine, a medical technology manufacturer in Huntley, is the defendant in a federal lawsuit alleging 
 violations of the False Claims Act by offering lucrative incentives to surgeons in exchange for their use of Life 
 Spine products. 
 The suit, which was filed last week by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, alleges 
 that the company entered into agreements with dozens of surgeons as a means to pay more than $7 million in 
 illegal kickbacks — including consulting fees, royalties and intellectual acquisition payments - for the surgeon's 
 use of Life Spine's equipment. 
 The suit also alleges that these agreements, spanning an estimated seven-year period, were done with the 
 knowledge, involvement and participation of Life Spine President and CEO Michael Butler and Vice President 
 of Business Development Richard Greiber, who also are being charged. 
 "Defendants are liable for damages based on the payment of claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid for 
 medical services and procedures involving Life Spine Products that were tainted by illegal kickbacks," the suit 
 reads. 
 About half of Life Spine's total domestic sales of spinal products between January 2012 and at least December 
 2018, were attributable to surgeries performed by these paid surgeons, according to the suit. 
 In addition to the consulting fees and royalties being paid, surgeons also were treated to dinners at high-end 
 restaurants, Chicago Cubs games and other perks. 
 "As alleged, Life Spine and its senior management flagrantly ignored the law by paying surgeons millions of 
 dollars in fees and royalties to get them to use Life Spine products during spinal surgeries," Manhattan U.S. 
 Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a release. "Kickbacks to doctors can alter or compromise their judgment 
 about the medical care and services to provide to patients, and can increase healthcare costs." 
 For the first two counts of violating the False Claims Act — which are against Life Spine, Butler and Greiber —
 the plaintiff is seeking treble damages and civil penalties to the maximum amount allowed by state law. 
 For the third count of unjust enrichment — which is only against Life Spine — the plaintiff is seeking damages to 
 the extent allowed by law. 
 The plaintiff also is seeking pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and any other relief the court deems 
 appropriate.

 Matters of Interest 
 The U.S. said a California cherry-picker went to Pakistan for terrorist training. Now the case has 
 collapsed. 
 Washington Post 
 By Meagan Flynn 
 7/31/19 
 It was a month after 9/11, and Osama bin Laden's face flashed across the news on Naseem Khan's TV screen. 
 The FBI was sitting in his living room in Bend, Ore., and Khan sensed an opportunity. The agents had come for 
 an entirely different purpose and were ready to leave — until Khan pointed at the screen and said he thought he 
 could help with something else. A few years ago, he said, he saw bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman al-
 Zawahiri, one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, at a mosque in the wine-country town of Lodi, Calif. 
 The agents perked up, intrigued by the possibility. Had they really just stumbled into a hot tip on al-Qaeda 
 while speaking to a 28-year-old McDonald's worker and convenience store clerk? The FBI thought Khan was 
 onto something — a possible "sleeper cell" of terrorism hidden in Lodi — and decided to dispatch him there as 
 a confidential informant. 
 Khan wouldn't find any associates of Zawahiri at the mosque in Lodi, and U.S. officials and terrorism experts 
 now doubt his initial claim about Zawahiri was ever true. But Khan would find 19-year-old Hamid Hayat —
 who would soon become the face of homegrown terrorism in post-9111 America. 
 They met at the mosque, and Khan learned Hayat was taking a trip to Pakistan with family. Over and over, in 
 recorded conversations, he returned to the same question: Would Hayat commit to attending a terrorist training 
 camp, as he had promised? 
 Now, a judge's order on Tuesday casts doubt on whether Hayat ever actually did. 
 Hayat, a cherry-picker and son of an ice cream truck driver, was convicted of attending the alleged terrorist 
 training camp and sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2006. Prosecutors, relying on Khan and Hayat's own 
 statements, alleged that he attended the camp for three to six months sometime in 2003. The case would become 
 one of the most high-profile examples of the government's fight against terrorism in the immediate aftermath of 
 9/11, especially because Hayat, after hours of interrogation by FBI agents, confessed to attending the camp. 
 But on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. vacated his conviction and sentence, finding that 
 Hayat had inadequate defense during the 2006 trial while casting doubt on the facts of the case. Burrell 
 questioned whether jurors would have convicted him had they heard evidence from witnesses in Pakistan, 
 which the judge said likely would have "undermined" jurors' confidence in Hayat's confession alone. His 
 attorneys have maintained the confession was coerced during an exhausting interrogation. 
 Had the defense attorney actually interviewed any witnesses in Pakistan who spent significant time with Hayat 
 during his trip, she would have discovered that they recalled Hayat spent most of his time playing video games 
 and cricket and that the purpose of his visit was for his family to find him a wife, according to Burrell's order. 
 No one identified any prolonged disappearance that would have allowed him to visit a terrorist training camp 
 for three to six months as prosecutors alleged and Hayat said in the confession, Burrell noted. Burrell, who 
 31 
 EFTA00018496
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 oversaw Hayat's original trial, found the witnesses gave consistent statements and could have provided Hayat a 
 credible alibi. 
 "Showing that Hayat could not have been at a jihadi training camp for the `period of months' specified in the 
 indictment would have been completely consistent with the defense that Hayat's confession should not be 
 credited and the government lacked other supporting evidence," a U.S. magistrate wrote in making the 
 recommendation that Hayat's conviction be vacated. Burrell adopted most of the magistrate's findings of fact. 
 The government has not decided yet whether to appeal the decision, a spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's 
 office in the Eastern District of California said in a statement, the Sacramento Bee reported. "We are in the 
 process of reviewing the district court decision and assessing what steps, if any, should be taken and 
 considering all our options," the statement said. 
 Hayat, now 36, is currently being held in a federal prison in Phoenix. His attorneys are seeking his immediate 
 release. 
 The case against Hayat and his father, Umer, who was accused of lying to the FBI, heaped international 
 attention on the Northern California town of Lodi. Seemingly overnight, the town went from the zinfandel 
 capital of the world to an alleged terrorism "sleeper cell" — a claim authorities would later walk back. 
 At the time he met Khan in August 2002, Hayat lived in his parents' garage and didn't have many friends, as 
 the Intercept recounted in a 2016 investigation. Posing as a radical Islamist, Khan nudged Hayat into 
 conversations that were anti-American and supportive of Islamic fundamentalist groups, and to his delight 
 Hayat went along with it, according to recorded conversations cited in federal court documents. Hayat approved 
 of the beheading of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl by Pakistani militants. He told Khan he believed 
 jihadists had attended his grandfather's religious school in Pakistan and claimed his grandfather was so 
 politically well connected that the Pakistani president enlisted him in efforts to persuade the Taliban to turn over 
 bin Laden after 9/11. 
 Then came the terrorist camps. Hayat said he had seen one in an online video — and expressed interest in going 
 himself. Khan, feeding the intel to the FBI, egged him on. 
 But once in Pakistan, Hayat kept making excuses, according to the judge's order. When Khan told him he was 
 being "lazy," Hayat claimed the climate had changed and it got too hot outside — the terrorist camp was 
 canceled, he said. Khan was starting to get mad. His nudges turned to threats. 
 "God willing, when I come to Pakistan and I see you, I'm going to ... force you to, get you from your throat and 
 ... throw you in the madrassa," Khan said in one expletive-laden recorded conversation, as the Intercept 
 reported. 
 "I'm not going to go with that," Hayat said. 
 "Oh yeah, you will go," Khan told him. "Yeah, you will go. You know what? Maybe I can't fight with you in 
 America, but I can beat your a-- in Pakistan, so nobody's going to come to your rescue." 
 In their last conversation, according to the Intercept, which obtained all the recordings, Hayat said he "never 
 intended on going to a camp." 
 32 
 EFTA00018497
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 Hayat denied attending a camp in his first interview with the FBI in Japan, before flying to San Francisco. He 
 confessed during his second interview in California upon his return in June 2005. 
 "FBI: Al Qaeda plot possibly uncovered," rang a CNN headline in June 2005, saying those involved "Trained 
 on how to kill Americans." 
 Months after Hayat's arrest, then-director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, testified in a 
 congressional hearing that a "network of Islamic extremists in Lodi, Calif., for example, maintained connections 
 with Pakistani militant groups, recruited United States citizens." 
 But ultimately, no other terrorism cases arose from the investigation except for the one against Hayat. Two 
 imams were investigated but were never criminally charged with anything. They had overstayed religious 
 worker visas, authorities discovered. 
 A retired FBI agent who watched Hayat's interrogation and the resulting confession told the Los Angeles Times 
 it was "the sorriest interrogation, the sorriest confession, I've ever seen," believing the agents fed Hayat the 
 details they wanted to hear and that Hayat repeated them so he could leave. He was barred from offering his 
 testimony at trial. Burrell found that the failure to challenge the validity of the confession by presenting a false 
 confession expert also contributed to his finding that Hayat had ineffective counsel. 
 Khan was ultimately paid nearly $230,000 for assisting the FBI over three years. During Hayat's trial, his 
 defense attorney questioned how one fast-food worker's implausible claim that he saw the world's most wanted 
 terrorist in a small-town mosque could have "sparked this whole investigation with this ridiculous claim," the 
 Times reported in 2006. 
 Hayat's attorneys filed an appeal in 2014 and ultimately sought to interview numerous witnesses in Pakistan 
 who could account for his whereabouts during the trip from 2003 to 2005. They appeared for sworn depositions 
 on video in 2018. When Hayat's attorney, Dennis Riordan, asked his uncle whether he "would have known" if 
 Hayat disappeared from their rural hamlet, Muhammad Anas said, "Naturally, I would have noticed," the 
 Marshall Project reported then. 
 The judge found that the witnesses "corroborated each other on some important points," regarding trips the 
 family took throughout Pakistan and who they visited. Once or twice a month, they traveled to a hospital for his 
 mother's medical treatment. 
 On Tuesday, Hayat's family issued a statement applauding the judge's decision to throw out Hayat's 
 conviction, the Sacramento Bee reported. 
 "We have been waiting 14 long years for Hamid to be freed," the statement read. "Hamid cannot get those 14 
 years of his life back, but we are relieved to see the case take such a big step forward. We miss him and hope to 
 be reunited with him soon."

 Fed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time Since 2008 Crisis 
 New York Times 
 By Jeanna Smialek 
 7/31/19 
 The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday as it attempted to 
 guard the record-long economic expansion against mounting global risks. 
 The widely expected quarter-point move, the Fed's first since it cut rates to near zero in 2008, is meant to 
 protect the economy against the potentially harmful effects of a growth slowdown in China and Europe and 
 uncertainty from President Trump's trade war. 
 "In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation 
 pressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," according to the Federal 
 Open Market Committee's policy statement. 
 But the Fed did not indicate that this was the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign, suggesting instead that the 
 cut was a minor adjustment intended to help the economy weather any challenges from slowing global growth 
 and Mr. Trump's trade fights.

 Catch up and prep for the week ahead with this newsletter of the most important business insights, delivered 
 Sundays. 
 While Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, left the door open to additional rate moves if the economy showed signs 
 of sputtering, he did not indicate the central bank was poised to engage in the sort of deep cutting cycle that the 
 Fed has done in the past to avert or offset recessions. 
 "It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts - I didn't say it's just one," Mr. Powell said at a news 
 conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. "What we're seeing is that it's appropriate to adjust 
 policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that's how we're looking at it." 
 The widely expected move from the central bank was initially greeted with a shrug in financial markets, where 
 investors have been factoring in a rate cut for months. But the stock market turned lower after Mr. Powell began 
 his news conference at 2:30 p.m., as investors absorbed the chair's comments as indicating the Fed was unlikely 
 to make additional cuts anytime soon, as investors had hoped. 
 By the end of the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent. It was the benchmark index's worst decline since 
 May 31. 
 The Fed dropped its target rate to a range between 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Officials also announced an early 
 end to its efforts to shrink the Fed's balance sheet, another attempt to keep the economy moving. The central 
 bank's holdings of government-backed bonds swelled during the financial crisis as it bought assets to try to 
 reinvigorate growth. Policymakers have been slowly siphoning off securities to return their balance sheet to a 
 more normal size, and that process was slated to end in September. It will now conclude Aug. I. 
 Why the Federal Reserve Cut Interest Rates 
 34 
 EFTA00018499
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 The move is what's called an "insurance cut" — one that central bankers are making to keep growth chugging 
 along. 
 Both Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Esther George, the president of 
 the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against Wednesday's decision, preferring instead to leave rates 
 unchanged. Those dissents marked the second and third of Jerome H. Powell's term as chair. 
 While Fed officials said they expect economic expansion to continue and the labor market to remain strong 
 "uncertainties about this outlook remain." 
 Mr. Powell said the Fed's move was "intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and 
 trade tensions." 
 He said that manufacturing around the world was weakening and that Mr. Trump's trade dispute was continuing 
 to spook American businesses. "The ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their 
 capital spending," he said. 
 Officials did not indicate in their statement whether this cut would be followed by additional moves. The Fed's 
 June economic projections suggest policymakers envision cutting rates slightly to shore up the economy, rather 
 than beginning an easing cycle that will return rates to zero. 
 "As the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
 monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to 
 sustain the expansion," the Fed said in its statement, seemingly leaving its options open. 
 Mr. Powell said the committee viewed the move as a "mid-cycle adjustment to policy," suggesting that the Fed 
 sees this cut as more similar to two instances in the 1990s, during which the Fed moved rates down slightly to 
 get the economy through periods of uncertainty, rather than the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign. 
 The Fed's rate cut carries political risks, given Mr. Trump's attacks on the central bank. Mr. Trump has been 
 denouncing the Fed in speeches and on Twitter for the past year, criticizing its four 2018 rate increases and 
 blaming its policies for slowing the American economy. Some onlookers may see Wednesday's move as caving 
 to the president. 
 The Fed operates independently of the White House. It attributed the change, which officials have been 
 signaling for months and which investors fully expected, to growing economic concerns. 
 "We also don't conduct monetary policy to prove our independence," Mr. Powell said. 
 The central bank is trying to extend a record-long economic expansion, because officials believe that doing so 
 will allow the Fed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and slow but steady inflation. The 
 unemployment rate is hovering around its lowest level in 50 years, but that has yet to push wages dramatically 
 higher in a way that forces companies to lift prices more quickly. 
 Inflation has run shy of the Fed's 2 percent goal since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012. A little 
 inflation helps to grease the wheels of a healthy economy, allowing businesses to raise wages faster and lifting 
 interest rates, giving the central bank more room to cut in the event of a downturn. 
 35 
 EFTA00018500
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
 Prices picked up just 1.6 percent in the year through June, not counting volatile food and fuel costs. 
 Wages are growing only moderately. An index of employment costs climbed by 2.7 percent in the second 
 quarter from a year earlier, less than expected and a slowdown from earlier in 2019, according to data released 
 on Wednesday. 
 Global policy uncertainty has also increased, and manufacturing is slumping the world over. Growth is slowing 
 in China and Europe, and Mr. Trump's trade war with China and threats of further tariffs on United States 
 trading partners are stoking uncertainty and causing businesses to hold off on investment. 
 Those developments threaten the economic outlook, even as growth remains solid, consumer spending is robust 
 and the job market holds up for now.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 Defendant. 
 ------------ ---------------- --------- ----- x 
 THE GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDUM 
 IN SUPPORT OF DETENTION 
 For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine 
 Maxwell, the defendant, poses an extreme risk of flight; that she will not be able to rebut the 
 statutory presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
 appearance of the defendant as required, 18 U.S.C. § 3 I42(e)(3)(E); and that the Court should 
 therefore order her detained. 
 The charges in this case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine 
 Maxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial sexual predator, exploited and abused young 
 girls for years. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell now faces the very real 
 prospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government's evidence and the 
 substantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for 
 the defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant's extensive international ties, 
 her citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United 
 States. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international 
 connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a 
 lengthy prison sentence. 
 EFTA00018506
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 3 of 10 
 BACKGROUND 
 On June 29, 2020, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a 
 sealed indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of conspiracy to entice 
 minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; one count of enticing 
 a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2; one count of 
 conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; 
 one count of transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 
 and 2; and two counts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
 The charges arise from a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls at Epstein's properties 
 in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, between approximately 1994 and 1997. During that time, 
 Maxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest 
 associates. 
 Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
 engage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played 
 a key role in Epstein's abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse 
 underage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor 
 victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended 
 would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in 
 multiple ways. For example, she attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their 
 lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with 
 Epstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who 
 seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, 
 2 
 EFTA00018507
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 4 of 10 
 the defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein's offers of financial assistance, including 
 offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as 14 years old when 
 they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims 
 were minors. 
 The Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In 
 2016, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern 
 District of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in 
 facilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about 
 her conduct with minor girls. 
 ARGUMENT 
 I. Applicable Law 
 Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
 order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
 danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). A finding of risk of flight must 
 be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 
 789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. 
 Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by 
 clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir. 
 1995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. 
 The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
 nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
 (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
 financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
 3 
 EFTA00018508
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 5 of 10 
 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is 
 entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
 see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (Government entitled 
 to proceed by proffer in detention hearings). 
 Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
 other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
 trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
 committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be 
 presumed, subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure 
 the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3142(e)(3)(E). 
 II. Discussion 
 For the reasons set forth below, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and 
 therefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every 
 one of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the 
 offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel 
 strongly in favor of detention. 
 A. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
 The "nature and circumstances" of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges, 
 the defendant committed serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3142(g)(1) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
 factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex 
 4 
 EFTA00018509
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 6 of 10 
 acts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or combination 
 of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 
 (e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as 14 years 
 old, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors. 
 These offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years' 
 imprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in 
 assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, 
 at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) ("[T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight 
 risk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .") (quoting United States v. 
 Alindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory 
 maximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone 
 to flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at 
 age 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison. 
 The strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become 
 a fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong. 
 Multiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the 
 defendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony, 
 and other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence 
 corroborate the victims' account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial 
 in this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
 The passage of time between the defendant's conduct and these charges does not counsel 
 otherwise. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
 which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
 5 
 EFTA00018510
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 7 of 10 
 date of the amendment,' to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor 
 victim. See United States v. Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because 
 Congress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the 
 previous statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
 No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). Moreover, while 
 the conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term 
 of incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent. 
 Each of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
 the possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
 described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
 B. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
 The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an 
 initial matter, the defendant's extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her 
 to flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom, 
 where she attended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 
 2002, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from 
 United States Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") reflect that she has engaged in frequent 
 international travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations 
 including the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent 
 with her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States, 
 France, and the United Kingdom. 
 ' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until 
 the victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment 
 remained timely as of the 2003 amendment described above. 
 6 
 EFTA00018511
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 8 of 10 
 In addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that 
 would enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government's investigation to date, the 
 Government has identified more than 15 different bank accounts held by or associated with the 
 defendant from 2016 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those 
 accounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $20 
 million. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of 
 hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as 
 recently as 2019. For example, the defendant transferred $500,000 from one of her accounts to 
 another in March 2019, and transferred more than $300,000 from one of her accounts to another 
 in July 2019. She has also reported, including as recently as 2019, that she holds one or more 
 foreign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars. 
 The defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2016 property sale. 
 In particular, in 2016, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $15 
 million through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling 
 more than $14 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as 
 the owner. Several days later, more than $14 million was transferred from that account into 
 another account opened in the name of the defendant.2 In short, the defendant's financial resources 
 appear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her 
 total financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to 
 the Government. 
 2 The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring 
 between 2007 and 2011, approximately more than $20 million was transferred from accounts 
 associated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in 
 the millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with 
 Epstein.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 9 of 10 
 The defendant's international connections and significant financial means would present a 
 clear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by 
 the transient nature of defendant's current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively 
 been in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July 
 2019. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances - stopped 
 appearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears 
 that she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice, 
 switching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name "G Max") and email 
 address, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label. 
 Most recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a 156-acre property acquired in an 
 all -cash purchase in December 2019 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New 
 Hampshire, an area to which she has no other known connections. 
 The defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United 
 States. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not 
 appear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does 
 she appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the 
 Government respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of 
 overcoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could 
 reasonably assure the defendant's continued appearance in this case. 
 In particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to 
 mitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring 
 device. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start 
 should she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1

 home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant's head start");

 Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same). 
 CONCLUSION 
 As set forth above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. The Government respectfully 
 submits that the defendant cannot meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption in 
 favor of detention. There are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in 
 court proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.

 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the 
 government's July 2, 2020 Memorandum in Support of Detention ("Gov. Mem."). 
 It is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public attention than the 
 government's prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). In July 2019, Epstein was indicted for 
 offenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media attention focused on the 
 nature of the charges and Epstein's wealth and lifestyle. On August 10, 2019, Epstein died in 
 federal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute 
 her for Epstein—even though she'd had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had 
 never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always 
 denied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were 
 threatening and harassing to our client and those close to her. 
 But sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not 
 Jeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government's indictment of Epstein in 2019, despite 
 the fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current 
 indictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years 
 ago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the 
 presumption of innocence. Far from "hiding," she has lived in the United States since 1991, has 
 litigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even 
 once since Epstein's arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly 
 publicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes 
 before this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and 
 other circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject 
 to the strict conditions proposed below. 
 EFTA00018519
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 6 of 26 
 Background. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the 
 United States since 1991. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United 
 Kingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell 
 graduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in 1991, and has lived in this 
 country ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her 
 six siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2019 
 indictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her now. She is especially close to two of her 
 sisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has 
 numerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to 
 many of them. Ms. Maxwell's family and friends have remained committed to her because they 
 do not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have known for 
 decades. 
 The Government's Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in showing 
 that detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
 will secure a defendant's appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government 
 relies on the presumption of detention in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms. 
 Maxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of 
 the United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for 
 each country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing 
 recent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was "hiding" from law 
 enforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular 
 contact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein's arrest. Finally, the government 
 argues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant 
 2 
 EFTA00018520
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 7 of 26 
 detention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government 
 does not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section 
 3142(g)(4). 
 Ms. Maxwell's Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms. 
 Maxwell, on the strict conditions proposed below (or as modified by the Court), for two 
 compelling reasons. 
 First, the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As 
 this Court has noted, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to 
 incarcerated individuals, and COVID-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with 
 pretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant's ability to prepare her defense. Simply put, 
 under these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious 
 risk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9). 
 Second, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under 
 the Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government 
 may be rebutted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S. 
 citizen and has lived in this country for almost 30 years; she ran a non-profit company based in 
 the United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it down to 
 protect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with 
 family members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct 
 indicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil 
 litigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from 
 the time of Epstein's arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the 
 government. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable 
 3 
 EFTA00018521
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 8 of 26 
 purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention 
 and its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities, 
 and reputational damage simply for knowing her. The government's remaining arguments—
 about Ms. Maxwell's passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they 
 would require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail, 
 which is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed below, the government's position regarding 
 the nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged 
 conduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail 
 analysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 21). 
 Proposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the following bail 
 conditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous 
 situations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible 
 people, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United 
 Kingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ii) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of 
 New York; (iii) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict 
 supervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of 
 New York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell's immediate 
 family, close friends and counsel; (vii) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel's 
 office, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (viii) such other 
 terms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3142. 
 The Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is 
 entitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) 
 ("Nothing in this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of 
 4 
 EFTA00018522
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 9 of 26 
 innocence."). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell 
 presents an "actual risk of flight" and must be detained under Section 3142. The strict bail 
 conditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the "least restrictive" 
 set of conditions that will "reasonably assure" Ms. Maxwell's appearance in Court, without the 
 health and access to counsel risks inherent in the government's request that Ms. Maxwell be 
 detained pending trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(I)(B). Under the controlling legal standards, 
 Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail. 
 ARGUMENT 
 There are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell's release 
 on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed: 
 First, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-19 if she is detained, 
 and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the 
 restrictions that have been placed on attorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic. 
 Second, the government has failed to cany its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142 that no 
 combination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in 
 court. 
 I. The Conditions Created by the COVID-19 Pandemic Mandate the Release of 
 Ms. Maxwell. 
 Impact of COVID-I 9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by 
 the COVID-19 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell's release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions. 
 Four months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, 15-CR-95 (AJN), 2020 WL 
 1295155 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020), that COVID-19 is an "unprecedented and extraordinarily 
 dangerous" threat that justifies release on bail. Id. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no 
 underlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court's 
 5 
 EFTA00018523

 prior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-19. At the time, COVID-
 19 had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no known outbreak in 
 the prison population. Nevertheless, the Court noted that "inmates may be at a heightened risk of 
 contracting COVID-19 should an outbreak develop," and, based in part on this changed 
 circumstance, ordered the defendant released. Id. 
 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-19 risks to inmates have 
 increased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-19 in correctional 
 facilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates known to have COVID-19 has 
 doubled to 68,000, and prison deaths tied to COVID-19 have increased by 73 percent.' Indeed, 
 as of July 2, 2020, nine of the ten largest known clusters of the coronavirus in the United States 
 are in federal prisons and county jails.2 As this Court noted last month, "the `inability [of] 
 individuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene 
 products' [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable." United States

 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The risks are further enhanced by the possibility 
 of a second wave of coronavirus cases.;
 In particular, COVID-19 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan Detention Center 
 (MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her 
 there on July 6, 2020. According to the MDC's statistics, as of April 3, 2020, two inmates and

 five staff had tested positive; by June 30, 2020, those numbers had risen to 14 and 41, 
 respectively. 4 The increased spread among prisons means that the COVID-19 risks that were 
 present in the Stephens case four months ago are far more serious for Ms. Maxwell now and 
 mandate her release. 
 Impact of COVID-I 9 on the Ability to Prepare the Defense. The Stephens opinion 
 provides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell's release: if she is 
 detained, her ability to meet with her attorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly 
 impaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 
 In Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant's release under 18 
 U.S.C. § 3142(i), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such 
 release is "necessary for preparation of the person's defense." Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at 
 *3. The Court noted that the spread of COVID-19 had compelled the BOP to suspend all in-
 person visits, including legal visits, except as allowed on a case-by-case basis. Id. at *3. That 
 suspension persists to this day.5 In a case such as this, which will require assessing evidence 
 relating to events that occurred approximately twenty-five years ago, including documents and 
 personal recollections, numerous in-person meetings between counsel and Ms. Maxwell will be 
 critical to the preparation of the defense. The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into 
 question whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial. As in

 Stephens, Ms. Maxwell's inability to meet with her attorneys while this policy is in effect 
 constitutes a "compelling reason" requiring her release. Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at *3.6
 Even speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-
 19-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours' notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in 
 which case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week, 
 however, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required. 
 At approximately 5:30 p.m. on July 6, 2020, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell 
 about waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and 
 ordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:00 p.m. that night with a proposed date 
 and time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call, 
 making specific reference to the Court's Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until 
 9:00 p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to 
 reach our client in time if she is detained.' In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has 
 not been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials. 
 The prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her 
 review, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case 
 compound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review

 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants 
 released on bail, over the government's objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant's ability to 
 prepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 20-MJ-3073 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2020) (releasing 
 undocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and 
 risk of COVID-19); United States v. Hudson, 19-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (releasing defendant in 
 drug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-I9 bail applications were denied, 
 because of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-19); United States v. Chandler, 19-CR-867 
 (PAC), 2020 WL 1528120, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with 
 prior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-19 restrictions). 
 7 
 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell 
 each morning until the initial appearance to facilitate attorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate 
 these efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shows no signs of abating. Nor would it be 
 appropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our 
 communications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.

 in the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional "compelling reasons" 
 justifying her release. See id.8
 II. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. 
 The grave concerns raised by the current COVID-19 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell 
 must be released because she has met her limited burden of production showing that she does not 
 pose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition 
 or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in court. 
 A. Applicable Law 
 As the Supreme Court has recognized, "[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention 
 prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception." United States v. Salerno, 481 
 U.S. 739, 755 (1987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where "no condition or combination 
 of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant]." United States v. 
 Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)). The Bail Reform Act 
 provides that a court "shall order the pretrial release" of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3142(b)) 
 (emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if "such release will not reasonably assure the 
 appearance" of the defendant in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). Where conditions are necessary, 
 such release shall be "subject to the least restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court] 
 determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required." 18 U.S.C. § 
 3142(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, "[u]nder this statutory scheme, `it is only a 
 limited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial."' Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 
 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
 8 See also Letter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2020), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v. 
 Federal Bureau of Prisons, et at, No. 19 Civ. 660 (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc. No. 78) (detailing absence of in-person 
 visitation, highly limited VTC and telephone call capacity, and issues pertaining to legal mail and legal documents).

 EFTA00018527
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 14 of 26 
 The government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government 
 must show "by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant ... presents an actual risk of 
 fl ight." Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this 
 burden, it must then "demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or 
 combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his 
 presence in court." Id. 
 In determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
 appearance of the defendant, the court must consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the 
 offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and 
 characteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or 
 the community that would be posed by the person's release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). 
 In this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms. 
 Maxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply. 
 The Bail Reform Act contains a rebuttable presumption, applicable based on certain of 
 the crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See 18 U.S.C. § 
 3 I42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the "defendant bears a limited burden of 
 production —not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with 
 evidence that [she] does not pose ... a risk of flight." See United States v. English, 629 F.3d 
 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). This rebuttable presumption can be readily 
 satisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-11-70756 MAG (DMR), 2011 WL 3421321, at *2 
 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011), and "[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a 
 category listed in § 3142(g) can affect the operation" of the presumption. United States v. 
 Dominguez, 783 F.2d 702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Mattis, No. 20-1713, 
 10 
 EFTA00018528
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 15 of 26 
 2020 WL 3536277, at *4-5 (2d Cir. June 30, 2020). Although the presumption "remains a factor 
 to be considered" even after the defendant has met her burden of production, "[a]t all times ... 
 the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by ... a preponderance of the 
 evidence" that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions. 
 English, 629 F.3d at 319 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States 
 v. Deutsch, No. I 8-CR-502 (FB), 2020 WL 3577398, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July I, 2020). And 
 regardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, "[n]othing in 
 this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence." 
 18 U.S.C. § 31420); see also United States v. Crowell, No. 06-CR-291E(F), 2006 WL 3541736, 
 at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2006) (those charged with crimes involving minors "continue to enjoy 
 the presumption of innocence in setting conditions of release."). 
 B. Ms. Maxwell Has Rebutted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight 
 Risk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No 
 Combination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her 
 Presence In Court 
 The government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions 
 will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance in court. As set forth below, Ms. 
 Maxwell's personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior 
 to her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same 
 reasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which 
 are consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release, 
 will not "reasonably assure" her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms. 
 Maxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.

 1. Ms. Maxwell's Personal History and Characteristics 
 Demonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk 
 a. Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has 
 Significant Ties to the United States and the New York Region 
 Ms. Maxwell's history and characteristics do not "strongly support detention," as the 
 government contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in 
 this country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail 
 conditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-
 five -year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the 
 present. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this 
 country for almost 30 years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. Ms. Maxwell 
 also has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign 
 her bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-born 
 citizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with 
 them, as well as with her nieces and nephews. Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close 
 friends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has 
 been Ms. Maxwell's home for decades. 
 b. Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District 
 and Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein's 2019 Arrest 
 Ms. Maxwell has never once attempted to "hide" from the government or her 
 accusers, and has never shown any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms. 
 Maxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct 
 related to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully 
 intends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example, 
 since 2015, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil 
 12 
 EFTA00018530
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 17 of 26 
 cases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in 
 those cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case, 
 which has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the 
 United States. Indeed, on July 7, 2019, the day after Epstein's arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached 
 out to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and 
 maintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest. 
 The government's broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in "frequent 
 international travel" in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she 
 has not left the country even once since Epstein's arrest. Ms. Maxwell's decision to remain 
 in the United States after Epstein's arrest and subsequent death in August 2019 is 
 particularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been 
 even more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein's death, a steady stream of press 
 articles began turning the public's attention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for 
 Epstein —and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government's 
 investigation. 9 Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be 
 victims of Epstein's abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution. 
 Despite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was 
 redirected toward her after Epstein's death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave 
 the country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was 
 arrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v. Friedman, 
 9 See, e.g., Spotlight turns on Jeffrey Epstein's British socialite :fixer' Ghislaine Maxwell after his suicide — but will 
 she be prosecuted?, Daily Mail (Aug. 10, 2019) https://svww.dailymail.co.uk/newstarlicle-7344765/Spotlight-turns-

 837 F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d Cir. 1988) (overturning district court's decision that defendant posed 
 a flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took "no steps" to flee 
 jurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home and arrest); 
 United States v. DiGiacomo, 746 F. Supp. 1176, 1179-80 (D. Mass. 1990) (concluding 
 defendants did not present a flight risk because each of them "for three years knew there 
 was substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not attempt to flee 
 before indictment"). 
 Indeed, the absence of any allegation by the government that Ms. Maxwell was 
 taking steps to leave the country at the time of her arrest is conspicuous. The government 
 has offered no proof that she was making plans to leave the country. In fact, had the 
 government alerted her counsel that she was about to be arrested, we would have arranged 
 for Ms. Maxwell's prompt, voluntary surrender. Instead, the government arrested Ms. 
 Maxwell without warning on the day before the July 4th holiday, thus ensuring that she 
 would be in federal custody on the one-year anniversary of Epstein's arrest. 
 c. Ms. Maxwell's Actions to Protect Herself From Intrusive Media 
 Coverage and Death Threats Do Not Demonstrate an Intent to 
 Flee 
 Furthermore, the steps Ms. Maxwell took to leave the public eye after Epstein's 
 arrest are not indicative of a risk of flight. The government notes that Ms. Maxwell dropped 
 out of public view after Epstein's arrest, which the government seeks to portray as "hiding" 
 from the law. The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid 
 detection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov. 
 Mem. at 8). But Ms. Maxwell did not take these steps to hide from law enforcement or 
 evade prosecution. Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 19 of 26 
 take to protect herself, her family members, her friends and colleagues, and their children, 
 from unrelenting and intrusive media coverage, threats, and irreparable reputational harm. 
 Ever since Epstein's arrest, Ms. Maxwell has been at the center of a crushing 
 onslaught of press articles, television specials, and social media posts painting her in the 
 most damning light possible and prejudging her guilt. The sheer volume of media reporting 
 mentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein's arrest, she has been mentioned in 
 literally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media 
 attention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In 
 November 2019, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £10,000 bounty for information 
 about Ms. Maxwell's location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read: 
 "WANTED: The Sun is offering a £10,000 reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal 
 Ghislaine Maxwell."10 And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media 
 reports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid 
 questioning by the FBI." She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in 
 the bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell's arrest on July 2, 2020, her counsel has been flooded 
 with hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public. 
 The "open season" declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein's death has come with an 
 even darker cost - she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and 
 has had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only 
 intensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends. Some of Ms. 
 Maxwell's closest friends who had nothing whatsoever to do with Epstein have lost their jobs or

 suffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms. 
 Maxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from 
 everyone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and 
 her friends out of harm's way.12
 Lacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell 
 presents an "actual risk of flight," Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government's flight risk 
 argument is reduced to the following: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign 
 citizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who now faces serious charges. 
 But if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any 
 meaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United 
 States 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must show 
 more than "opportunities for flight," and instead must establish an "inclination on the part of 
 [the defendant] to flee"). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in 
 this Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of 
 fl ight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial 
 foreign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v. 
 Hansen, 108 F. App'x 331 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 
 2009); United States v. Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. 
 Jan. 28. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v. 
 Kashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). 
 Finally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would 
 pose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell's ability to flee the United States, particularly to 
 12 The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had 
 direct communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever. One such person has 
 even given numerous television interviews on news shows in the United Kingdom.

 France and the United Kingdom.13 Notably, two weeks ago, this Court recognized in United 
 States v. Abdellatif El Mokadem, No. 19-CR-646 (AJN), 2020 WL 3440515 (S.D.N.Y. June 
 23, 2020) that "concerns regarding risk of flight are mitigated by the ongoing [COVID-19] 
 pandemic, which has understandably curtailed travel across the country, and, indeed, around 
 the world." Id. at *1. In that case, despite finding detention to be warranted on two prior 
 occasions, the Court concluded that the government could no longer establish flight risk and 
 ordered the defendant released pending sentencing. Id. ("Taking account of the COVID-19 
 pandemic, which had not yet reached this country when the Court last considered 
 Defendant's custody status, the balance now clearly and convincingly tips in Defendant's 
 favor ... ."). Consideration of this factor weighs heavily in favor of release on the proposed 
 bail conditions here. 
 2. The Nature and Circumstances of the Charges and the 
 Weight of the Evidence Militate in Favor of Bail 
 The Defense Has Rebutted the Presumption Relating to Certain of the Charges. The 
 government relies on the statutory presumption of detention applicable to offenses involving 
 minor victims. (Gov. Mem. at 4-5.) But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the 
 government does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that 
 she suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein, 
 425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 314-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Even according to the indictment, Ms.

 applicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebutted that 
 presumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country 
 after Epstein's arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follow 
 other courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebutted the 
 presumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged 
 offenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2020 WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres, 
 No. 3:20-CR-18-J-32JBT, 2020 WL 1042051, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2020); Conway, 
 2011 WL 3421321, at *4-5. 
 The Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that 
 detention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem. 
 at 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential 
 punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit "require[s] more than evidence of 
 the commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a 
 finding of risk of flight." Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court's finding that 
 defendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for "long sentence 
 of incarceration"); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order 
 where defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact 
 that they faced a "lengthy term of incarceration"). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a 
 long sentence does not meet the government's burden of persuasion.14
 14 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009), cited 
 approvingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, at •2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) for 
 the proposition that "[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering 
 the strong case of the government ...." (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts 
 from Ms. Maxwell's case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 20-year old conduct as here, but 
 instead involved a conspiracy that "continu[ed] until the date of the indictment." 627 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61. The 
 evidence included eleven "clearly incriminating video tapes" and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and 
 the defendant faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Id. at 61-64. These factors are not present in this case. 
 18 
 EFTA00018536
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 23 of 26 
 Moreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend 
 "decades in prison" if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure 
 even if she were convicted on all counts is 10 years, assuming the Court were to follow the 
 traditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a 10-year 
 sentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government's forecast, further 
 demonstrating that the government has not met its burden of showing Ms. Maxwell is an 
 actual risk of flight. 
 The Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the 
 strength of the government's case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal 
 challenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein's 
 September 24, 2007 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which 
 covers "any potential co-conspirators of Epstein"; (ii) the conspiracy, enticement of minors, 
 and transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (iii) 
 the two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds." In addition, as 
 we understand from the face of the indictment, the government's case is based primarily on 
 the testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago 
 between 1994 and 1997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to 
 decades -old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government's 
 case, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail. 
 1S The defense is also considering whether the government's comments in connection with this case conform to 
 Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.

 3. The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than 
 Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell's Presence 
 For the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the 
 circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk 
 and prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government 
 has not carried its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed 
 bail package represents the "least restrictive" set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms. 
 Maxwell's presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(1)(B). 
 The package includes six co-signers-Ms. Maxwell's siblings, relatives and 
 friends —many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her 
 despite the unrelenting media attacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered 
 as a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an 
 extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is 
 also to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million. 
 The package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering 
 all passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern 
 Districts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell, 
 for personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release. 
 Under the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial 
 Services. 16
 10 In United States v. Houston!, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2019), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under 
 which a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed 
 security guards. Houston!, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant 
 "is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because ofhis wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a 
 condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained." Id. (emphasis in original). We submit 
 that a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United 
 States, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did 
 20 
 EFTA00018538
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 25 of 26 
 Ms. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal 
 circumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in 
 connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them 
 and their families from harm. 
 The proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this 
 Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v. 
 Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family 
 who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions), 
 aff'd, 749 F. App'x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831, 832 
 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Marc Dreier, accused of "colossal criminality" and alleged to be a "high 
 fl ight risk," granted release subject to conditions); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 
 240, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Bernie Madoff, charged with "largest Ponzi scheme ever and 
 alleged to be a "serious risk of flight," granted release subject to conditions). 
 not have Ms. Maxwell's means, would be released on bail conditions. Accordingly, if the Court deems it necessary, 
 it may impose private security guards as a condition of release.

 release on bail pursuant to the conditions she has proposed.

DAG Meeting Case Overview 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss 
 November 5, 2020 
 II. Charged Cases 
 U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN): This summer, we charged Ghislaine Maxwell with 
 conspiring to entice minors to travel for the purpose of sexual abuse in connection with helping 
 Jeffrey Epstein to abuse his many victims. The case focused on three specific victims that 
 traveled to be abused by Epstein, including instances in which Maxwell herself participated in 
 the acts of abuse. Trial is set for this coming July. We are finishing discovery, and motions are 
 scheduled for December. Motion practice could generate further press; for example, the 
 defendant continues to press for the identity of the specific victims, and if she is successful, that 
 would surely lead to a round of press about the victims and the details of our case. Relafiilliwe 
 are in plea negotiations with counsel for another Epstein co-conspirator. 
 who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his 
 sexual abuse, may plead to an obstruction of justice-related count.

 Good afternoon, 
 I am writing because my trial which was supposed to begin today has been moved to March 3rd. I asked the Court 
 (EDNY) for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly 
 that there was a Curcio issue. That application was denied. 
 So, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from 
 our firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make 
 another request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than 
 address the Curcio issue. 
 Thank you.

 FYI: state authorities in New Mexico are moving forward with their own plans with respect to the Epstein property. 
 Yesterday the state land commissioner revoked leases held by Cypress Inc. 
 https://www.abqjournal.com/1362185/land-commissioner-voids-epsteins-nm-grazing-leases.html 
 The linked news coverage quotes the New Mexico Attorney General as saying that he is conducting a criminal 
 investigation at the state level "in coordination with" the SDNY. Here are a few sentences from late in the article: 
 The [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land 
 Commissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General 
 Hector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased by 
 EFTA00018553
Epstein "because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given us 
 the perfect reason." 
 Balderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was "taking back lands that should be 
 managed to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children." Public schools are one 
 beneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: "We continue to investigate this matter at the state level 
 in coordination with U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 FAn I of 
 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 United States of America, 
 —v—
 Ghislaine Maxwell, 
 Defendant. 
 IISDC SDNY 
 DOCUMENT 
 ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
 DOC 0. 
 DATE FILED:7/30/2020 
 20-CR-330 (MN) 
 MEMORANDUM 
 OPINION & ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 Both parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on 
 most of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language 
 allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public 
 record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. 
 Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their 
 counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial 
 in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the 
 following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order. 
 Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for 
 good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." 
 The good cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether 
 dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of 
 the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's interest in the 
 information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party 
 seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good cause. Cl Gambale v. Deutsche 
 Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). 
 1 
 EFTA00018562
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 2 of 3 
 First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with 
 regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and 
 witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a 
 general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the 
 privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of 
 their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the protective order should 
 "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or 
 disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery 
 materials"); see also United States v. Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at 
 *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for 
 individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because 
 they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements 
 are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a 
 far different matter than simply making a public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey 
 Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no 
 relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy 
 interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks 
 undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by 
 law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly 
 reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allows the 
 Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant ... to Potential 
 Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the 
 defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, ¶ 5. This proposal adequately balances the interests at 
 2 
 EFTA00018563
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 3 of 3 
 stake. And as the Government's letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense 
 needs an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make 
 applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis. 
 Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use 
 discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The 
 request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal 
 matters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions 
 including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and 
 other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
 District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follow. 
 Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with 
 materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of 
 course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to 
 what materials were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's 
 papers explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a 
 fair trial. 
 For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, 
 which will be entered on the docket. 
 This resolves Dkt. No. 29. 
 SO ORDERED.

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful 
 that your client is open to speaking with us. 
 On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and 
 your client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done 
 with you (and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our 
 ability, and then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
 Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include 
 individuals in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is 
 providing support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness 
 wants to speak with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his 
 capacity as an attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just 
 want to confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to 
 pay for third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we 
 certainly could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it 
 easier for the friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful —
 I'll be at my desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at or we could also set a time to 
 chat, whatever would be helpful.

 Hello 
 Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
 • That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
 involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
 • In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
 • That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need 
 to be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
 Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible?

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 NUN York NY 10022 
 .1 212 957 7600 phone 
 nvoacclaenTesser corn 
 On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter motion 
 seeking the Court's assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell's ability 
 to receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an 
 order directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged 
 victims referenced in the indictment ("Victims 1-3"), subject to the restrictions of the protective 
 order entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully 
 investigate the alleged conduct, which is now over 25 years old. Second, we request that the 
 Court enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to release Ms. Maxwell into the 
 general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials 
 while she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 
 1. Disclosure of Victim Identities 
 The Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to 
 defense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot 
 prepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is 
 authorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrowly-tailored and reasonable under the 
 circumstances of this case. 
 Here, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government's case is based on the 
 accounts of Victims 1-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is 
 therefore critical for the defense to know the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so

 The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 10, 2020 
 Page 2 
 that we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is 
 especially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly 
 25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United 
 Kingdom —and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in 
 misconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to 
 speculate which of these individuals are Victims 1-3 referenced in the indictment. 
 It is now almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell's arrest, and the government is just now 
 beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would 
 begin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not 
 confirmed to the defense the identities of Victims 1-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 
 2020. On July 14, 2020, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that 
 it had "begun preparing an initial production" and would be "prepared to produce a first batch of 
 discovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court."' The Court entered the 
 protective order on July 30, 2020. (Dkt. 36). The following day, July 31, 2020, defense counsel 
 contacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims 1-3. The 
 government refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims 
 through its production of Rule 16 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material 
 closer to trial. That same day, per the government's request, the defense provided a hard drive to 
 load the Rule 16 discovery. However, the government did not make its first production until 
 after 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2020. 
 The government's initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials, 
 totaling nearly 13,000 pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content. 
 Upon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual. 
 However, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim I, 2, or 3. 
 The defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three 
 alleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to 
 contain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has 
 indicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is 
 any guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged 
 Victims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks 
 until August 21, 2020 (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or 
 potentially months until November 9, 2020 (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before 
 learning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell's right to a fair trial depends on 
 the defense's ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will 
 be significantly impaired until we know for certain the names of Victims 1-3.

 government is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.").

 District courts have the inherent authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of 
 government witnesses. See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975). Such 
 disclosure is warranted when there is a specific showing that the disclosure is material to the 
 preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See 
 id. at 302; United States v. Rueb, No. 00 CR. 91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 
 5, 2001) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant "ha[d] met his burden 
 to show a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure").2 This 
 principle has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a 
 defense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and 
 warrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. 09CR19A, 2009 WL 
 427111, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime 
 victim where "defendant's ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is 
 significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim"); see also 
 id. ("Absent knowing the identity of Victim 1, the defendant is precluded from investigating the 
 facts surrounding the crime charged."). 
 The defense's narrowly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity 
 of Victims 1-3, and not the government's entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the 
 circumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense 
 counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any 
 alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 ¶ 5), the 
 disclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims 1-3. Nor is there any basis for 
 the government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to 
 testify. ; To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in 
 criminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein, 
 Ms. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to 
 give interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims 1-3 
 are no longer minors, but are now adults in their late 30s or early 40s, which provides additional 
 assurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here. 
 2 In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have 
 considered the following factors: (1) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2) 
 Have the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case 
 largely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a 
 realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses' names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the 
 prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege 
 offenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants' defense complex and 
 difficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb, 
 2001 WL 96177, at *7-8 (citation omitted). The Second Circuit, however, has not adopted these factors, nor do they 
 constitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities 
 of alleged victims. 
 3 Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community. 
 (See 7/14/2020 Tr. at 37:15-21).

 See Warme, 2009 WL 427111, at *2 (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime 
 victim where "the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the identity to the defendant 
 would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the likelihood that victim will refuse 
 to appear or testify"). 
 With each day that passes without knowing the identities of Victims 1-3, the defense is 
 losing crucial time to conduct a meaningful investigation and prepare its defense so that Ms. 
 Maxwell can receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. For these reasons, we 
 respectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to 
 defense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order. 
 2. Ms. Maxwell's Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery 
 We also seek the Court's assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement 
 at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC"), and her access to the discovery in this case, so 
 that she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed below, Ms. Maxwell has been 
 treated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in 
 her defense. 
 It has become apparent that the GOP's treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the 
 circumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2019, Mr. 
 Epstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on sex 
 trafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU") 
 due to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 
 2019, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On 
 August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein's body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government 
 indicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein's 
 death. 
 As a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than 
 other similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a 
 defense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a 
 month ago, on July 6, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms. 
 Maxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-
 day period (40 days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three 
 weeks longer than the 14-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under 
 current COVID-19 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to 
 be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom 
 do not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms. 
 Maxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense 
 counsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being 
 woken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the

 Good afternoon-
 In compliance with the Court's order, dated August 25th (attached), I hereby notify you 
 of recent third-party interference with the "secure" Webex line used for confidentiaUprivileged communication 
 between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
 At the conclusion of yesterday afternoon's VTC session, Ms. Maxwell observed 
 suspicious activity on the VTC monitor. 
 She alerted MDC staff, and Case ManagerMvitnessed the activity. 
 This is contrary to the Court's finding that "according to the Government and MDC Legal [Ms. Maxwell]'s 
 difficulties communicating with counsel have been resolved" and contrary to "MDC's Legal assurances that [Ms. 
 Maxwell]'s legal communication has not been interfered with..." 
 Previously, the MDC has disputed such claims concerning interference with 
 VTC communication between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
 Now, an MDC insider bears witness to complaint by Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
 Please provide explanation for this interference and evidence of remediation 
 before I report this latest problem to the Court. 
 Thank you-

 fact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting 
 risk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to 
 undergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell's access to the standard prison 
 resources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively 
 curtailed or eliminated altogether. 
 This treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to participate in her 
 defense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms. 
 Maxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes 
 on them, and to discuss them with her attorneys. But there currently is no such structure in 
 place. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard 
 drive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing 
 the first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell. 
 Defense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a 
 procedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery 
 materials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are 
 two significant flaws in this proposal: 
 • The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms. 
 Maxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including 
 showers. The BOP should not be permitted to force Ms. Maxwell to 
 choose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and 
 participating in her own defense. 
 • Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three 
 hours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing 
 documents in a complex case with voluminous document discovery, such 
 as this one. As an illustration, the government's first set of production 
 materials consists of nearly 13,000 pages of documents. Assuming it 
 takes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those 
 materials, based on the BOP's proposed cap of three hours per day of 
 review, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of 
 documents at the earliest by mid-November 2020. This is entirely 
 unworkable under the schedule set by the Court. 
 Ms. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not 
 be specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her 
 defense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous 
 discovery that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 40 hours a week 
 or more reviewing the discovery. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time

 to review the discovery in the MDC so that she can engage in her defense full-time. We 
 therefore request that Ms. Maxwell: 
 • Be released to the general population and be granted the privileges given 
 to other pretrial detainees. 
 • Be given significantly increased access to a computer terminal in order to 
 review the discovery in this case. 
 For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully submit that the Court should grant Ms. 
 Maxwell's motion.

 Dear Judge Preska: 
 I write in response to the Court's Order of August 3, 2020 (Doc. 1069), the Order and 
 Protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. 1044) ("Protocol"), and to raise with the Court 
 the legal effect of new information that came to the attention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on 
 Friday, August 7, 2020. 
 New information: On Friday, August 7, 2020, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of 
 critical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 (the "Criminal Action"). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell's right to due process and 
 fairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit's review of the Court's unsealing 
 order of July 23, 2020. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal 
 defendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. 
 Counsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an 
 officer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because 
 it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use "for any civil 
 proceeding or any purpose other than the defense" of the criminal action absent "further order 
 of the Court." Protective Order, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) at 1(a), 18 (Exhibit A). As required by 
 that Protective Order and Judge Nathan's Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel 
 initiated a conferral with the U.S. Attorney's Office over the weekend concerning a 
 modification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second 
 Circuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order 
 in the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with 
 this Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under 
 seal if necessary).

 Honorable Loretta A. Preska 
 August 10, 2020 
 Page 2 
 Ms. Maxwell requests a temporary stay of the unsealing process for approximately 
 three weeks until the conclusion of (a) the conferral with the U.S. Attorney's Office to a 
 modification of the Protective Order in the Criminal Action and, if necessary, an application 
 and ruling by Judge Nathan on the issue, to permit the use of the information in this Court and 
 before the Second Circuit (under seal in both courts, if necessary), (b) an application to this 
 Court containing the new information in support of a request to stay the unsealing process 
 until the conclusion of the Criminal Action, and (c) a ruling by this Court on the motion for 
 stay. 
 Streamlining of Unsealing Process: As directed by the Court, counsel for Ms. Maxwell 
 conferred with plaintiff's counsel concerning various proposals to streamline the unsealing 
 process. Subject to Ms. Maxwell's request to temporarily pause the process as described 
 above, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we 
 hope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing 
 move ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to 
 notify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the 
 unsealing before deciding how to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the 
 Court and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are 
 limitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in 
 the past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the 
 excerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see 
 his or her own information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from 
 a Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to 
 send to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of 
 participating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed 
 to Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the 
 Protocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement. 
 We also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the 
 Original Parties to object and to respond from 14 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs 
 2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the 
 Protocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at 14 
 days given some practical considerations applicable to them. 
 Although the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of 
 Plaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements. 
 First, we carefully considered the Court's suggestion to reduce the number of pages of 
 briefing to ten pages per side. Id. Our initial Objection (DE 1057) was 14 pages long; 
 Plaintiff's Response was 19 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many 
 respects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have 15 pages to object to the 
 five motions proposed below, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to 
 keep it shorter than that, but also allow for more space to provide specifics to the Court. 
 Second, we have obtained new contact information for Doe 1 from a separate civil 
 suit. We believe that Doe 1 retains a right to notification and participation. We suggest 
 EFTA00018581

 August 10, 2020 
 Page 3 
 providing the Notice to Doe 1 at the new address for any future pleadings that implicate his or 
 her deposition, which is currently subject to the Second Circuit's stay. 
 Third, to prevent against some of the errors that occurred during the last round of 
 unsealings, we request that the Protocol be amended to require the Responding Original Party 
 who proposes unsealing to supply with their Response a proposed unredacted set of the 
 pleadings at issue, for the Court's consideration and for the Objecting Original Party or Non-
 Party to have the right of reply. Preparing those redactions after the fact allows much 
 ambiguity into the Court's ruling and we believe the Court's ruling should specify which 
 redactions it is accepting or rejecting at the time of ruling. 
 Finally, we request that the Court allow for the any objecting Non-Party or Original 
 Party be given 7 days following any unseal order to apply for relief in the Second Circuit from 
 the order prior to the documents being released. 
 Proposed Next Set of Docket Entries for Review: 
 Given the Second Circuit's stay concerning Ms. Maxwell and Doe l's deposition 
 transcripts and materials that quote from them, we propose that the Court deviate from the 
 Doe 1 and 2 chronology (given that Doe l's deposition is sprinkled throughout those motions) 
 and instead take the following five decided motions and their related pleadings. This list 
 represents the first five chronological decided motions that (a) have sealed or redacted 
 materials and (b) do not have attached or quote from documents subject to the stay. They are: 
 • 75 — Defendant's Motion to Compel Responses to Defendant's First Set of 
 Discovery Responses to Plaintiff 
 • 139 — Plaintiff's Brief in Support of the Privilege Claimed for In Camera 
 Submission 
 • 155 — Defendant's Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents 
 • 215 - Sharon Churcher Motion to Quash Subpoena 
 • 231 — Defendant's Motion to Reopen Deposition of Plaintiff 
 Counsel for Ms. Maxwell is available for a telephone conference to discuss any of the 
 foregoing, should the Court desire.

 Re: Conferral Concerning Use of Discovery Materials GM_00000847-962 
 Dear 
 Ms. Maxwell is actively litigating issues related to disclosure of confidential material 
 in ME v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) and a related appeal in the 
 United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 20-2413. 
 We intend to ask Judge Nathan for permission to refer to and attach, as exhibits, the 
 above referenced discovery materials which relate to the Government's efforts to 
 obtain civil litigation discovery material ("the Unsealing Materials") in two, settled, 
 civil matters in which Ms. Maxwell was named a defendant. These materials would 
 be disclosed to Judge Preska and designated as part of the appendix to Ms. Maxwell's 
 appeal in the Second Circuit. We have no objection, at this point, to filing the 
 materials under seal in both courts. 
 In your letter to defense counsel dated August 5, 2020 you designated the Unsealing 
 Materials as Confidential. We understand that the Unsealing Materials were filed ex 
 parte and remain sealed in the miscellaneous actions. The documents, however, do 
 not contain confidential information as that term is defined in paragraph 8 of the 
 Protective Order entered by Judge Nathan. The Unsealing Materials are ex parte 
 pleadings filed by the Government, transcripts of ex parte hearings regarding those 
 pleadings, and ex parte rulings on the pleadings. As least one set of individuals 
 outside this prosecution, the Boies, Schiller & Flexner lawyers cooperating with the 
 Government, are aware of the Unsealing Materials. Moreover, these are the types of 
 pleadings that the Second Circuit has characterized as judicial documents with a 
 presumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 
 2019). Ms. Maxwell, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order in this case, notifies 
 EFTA00018583
August 9, 2020 
 Page 2 
 the Government that she objects to the confidential designation and requests that the 
 Government withdraw the designation. 
 The relevance of these documents to the unsealing protocol currently in process 
 before Judge Preska and the related appeal are readily apparent and I believe that the 
 government should, in the interest of justice, agree to these requests. If that is not the 
 case, I am happy to confer further about the issue as soon as possible. The Second 
 Circuit Court of Appeals established an expedited briefing schedule and Judge Preska 
 ordered that the parties in 15 Civ. 7433 meet regarding modification to the unsealing 
 protocol by August 10, 2020. Accordingly, we will need to raise this issue with Judge 
 Nathan this week. 
 Please let me know your position on the matter and, if you would like to discuss the 
 request further, your availability on August 10 or 11, 2020. 
 Very truly yours, 
 Jeffrey S. Pagliuca

 Defendant submitted a letter on August 18 informing the Court about disruptions of 
 attorney -client video teleconferences. Dkt. No. 319. After conferring with MDC Legal, the 
 Government responded on August 23. Dkt. No. 326. According to the Government and MDC 
 Legal, the Defendant's difficulties in communicating with her counsel via video teleconference 
 have been resolved, and the Government's letter sufficiently addresses her other requests. The 
 Court finds MDC Legal's assurance that Defendant's communications have not been interfered 
 with, recorded, or listened to sufficient. No further application for relief was made in 
 Defendant's August 24 reply. Dkt. No. 327. The Court remains confident that Ms. Maxwell is 
 fully able to communicate with her defense counsel and to prepare for trial. If Defendant 
 experiences further issues in communicating with her counsel, she should promptly notify the 
 Court after conferring in good faith with the Government and MDC Legal. 
 SO ORDERED.

 Hi 
 Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up 
 with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in 
 the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached 
 file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, 
 we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials 
 you sent. 
 Thanks very much,

 Hi =, 
 Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to 
 transmit the scanned records to S but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we 
 last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials you 
 received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was 
 included). 
 Another person on our team, who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via 
 phone her number is and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end. 
 thanks again!

 In our first discovery letter to Jeffrey Epstein (attached) we made several disclosures about certain witness statements — 
 M, you might remember when we discussed this way back then. In an abundance of caution, we'd like to also provide 
 Maxwell with one of these statements in particular (the third in the letter). The text is copied here: 
 • During the Palm Beach Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a witness ("Witness-1") 
 disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to bring girls for sexualized massages, and 
 that the defendant told her: "the younger the better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who 
 were under the age of eighteen to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl 
 who was over eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 
 remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." Witness-1 is 
 represented by Rita Glavin, Esq. 
 For context, this witness is and she interacted with Epstein in the early 2000s. This statement occurred in a 
 videotaped interview with Palm Beach PD. Is it okay with you if we provide this same disclosure in a letter to Maxwell (or 
 a stand-alone letter, if you prefer)? Please let us know if you'd prefer that we take a different approach, and of course
 and and I are happy to discuss if a call is easier.

 If you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced in these materials, including 
 items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we will make arrangements for you to

 The defendant also made oral statements when he was arrested on or about July 6, 2019. 
 Notes memorializing those statements are included in this production and are marked with control 
 number USAO 002273. 
 The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
 and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This 
 disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information 
 constitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. 
 Specifically, the Government discloses the following: 
 • The victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-1" received a grand jury subpoena 
 from the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") in or about 2008. However, Victim-1 
 was never interviewed by law enforcement, including the West Palm Beach Police 
 Department, Federal Bureau of investigation ("FBI") or SDFL in connection with their 
 investigation, and Victim-1 did not testify before the grand jury in SDFL. Victim-1 was 
 first interviewed by law enforcement regarding Jeffrey Epstein in or about 2019, after 
 FBI agents from the New York Field Office working with this Office approached Victim-
 1. The victims identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" and "Victim-3" we both 
 interviewed by law enforcement in connection with the SDFL investigation in or around 
 2007. Please note that all three of these victims are currently represented by counsel. 
 • During an interview with FBI agents in West Palm Beach, Florida in or around 2007, the 
 victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" stated that during her first contact with 
 the defendant, she told the defendant that she had just turned eighteen, when in fact she 
 was younger than eighteen at the time. In subsequent interviews, Victim-2 has told law 
 enforcement that the first time she met Epstein, she told him that she was 16, when in fact 
 she was younger than sixteen. Victim-2 further stated that she brought other victims to 
 the defendant's residence for sexualized massages. She initially told these victims that 
 they should tell the defendant that they were older than they in fact were. Over time, 
 however, Victim-2 stopped telling other victims this because she came to understand that 
 the defendant had a specific preference for underage girls. 
 • During the Palm Beach Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a witness 
 ("Witness -1") disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to bring girls 
 for sexualized massages, and that the defendant told her: "the younger the 
 better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who were under the age of eighteen 
 to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl who was over 
 eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 
 remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." 
 Witness -1 is represented by Rita Glavin, Esq.

 Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), 
 and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule agreed upon by 
 the parties or set by the Court. 
 Disclosure by the Defendant 
 In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests 
 reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
 inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
 defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
 evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
 examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
 thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
 introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
 defendant intends to call at trial. 
 The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
 will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
 request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
 defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
 Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
 This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines 
 available for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations 
 pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks 
 prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions 
 remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court 
 six weeks in advance of the trial. 
 06.20.2018 
 EFTA00018621
Page 5 
 Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of this Office concerning plea offers, 
 no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
 of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
 reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
 constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 
 1376 (2012); Missouri v. Fiye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012).

 Hi =,

 I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
 would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
 review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
 did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
 huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
 Thanks so much—

 The FOIA media team advised they downloaded media from file number 31E-MM-108062, including audio and video. However, there seem to be some technical issues, 
 as they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the 1A Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a "codec problem," meaning there was probably some sort of 
 user error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever 
 sent us the media. With this one exemption, the rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items. 
 I'm not sure if this is all the media contained in the file though. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or need further assistance.

 Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we 
 were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents 
 that looked like the attached file — which looks like a photocopy of the CO. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, we have them 
 from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent.

 please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client for a

 Hey everyone: Here's the latest draft of our letter and declaration on this issue. We are still 
 confirming a few things, but they shouldn't impact the substance of the Maxwell discussion. There is 
 also a chance that there's a separate declaration from the MDC; if there is, it should contain the same 
 substance re: Maxwell that's in the attached draft. 
 Our response is due tomorrow. I'm generally around later this evening or tomorrow if there's 
 anything you'd like to discuss. 
 Thanks very much.

 Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 EFTA00018659
: We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
 explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
 and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
 their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
 important differences, including: 
 The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need for 
 such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
 At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside the 
 general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone for 
 approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
 There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
 room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, Maxwell 
 shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can therefore 
 provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access for other 
 MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
 Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
 receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day long, 
 and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same amount of 
 electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
 As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
 compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
 MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
 Best,

 Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 All: 
 I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
 trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
 Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
 counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
 general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
 population). 
 Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
 MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
 scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel 
 appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
 Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
 Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
 review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
 concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires 
 the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
 which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
 any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
 At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
 has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
 defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
 night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
 accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
 far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
 treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
 disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to explain
 the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with and before 
 our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
 Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
 amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
 Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
 explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
 Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
 access are as follows: 
 Accommodation Maxwell Rivera 
 Review of electronic 
 discovery (NB: each 
 defendant has laptop access) 
 13 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (91 hours total) 
 3 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (21 hours total) 
 Counsel visits (by video) 3 hours per day/5 days per 
 week (15 hours total) 
 Four hours per week (plus an 
 additional two hours 
 EFTA00018661
scheduled through the 
 Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
 total) 
 Weekend legal calls As needed Not available 
 The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
 criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
 you were all aware of this issue.  We are also happ to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
 meantime, we are working with to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
 explanation for the Court.

 NUMBS 
 Case No. 1:20-
 Filed Under Seal — Level II 
 AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF 
 AN APPLICATION FOR A SEARCH WARRANT 
 I,-, being first duly sworn, hereby depose and state as follows: 
 INTRODUCTION AND AGENT BACKGROUND 
 1. I make this affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant under Federal 
 Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 to authorize law enforcement to employ an electronic investigative 
 technique, which is described in Attachment B, to determine the location of the cellular device 
 assigned call numbe (the "Target Cellular Device"), which is described in 
 Attachment A. 
 2. I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and have 
 been since 2017. I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the 
 sexual exploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area 
 through classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my 
 responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, 
 enticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the 
 execution of search warrants involving electronic evidence and cellular devices. 
 3. The facts in this affidavit come from my personal observations, my training and 
 experience, and information obtained from other agents and witnesses. This affidavit is intended 
 EFTA00018664
to show merely that there is sufficient probable cause for the requested warrant and does not set 
 forth all of my knowledge about this matter. 
 4. One purpose of applying for this warrant is to determine with precision the Target 
 Cellular Device's location. However, there is reason to believe the Target Cellular Device is 
 currently located somewhere within this district. On or about June 30, 2020, United States 
 Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker, signed a warrant for cellphone location information for the 
 Target Cellular Device (the "GPS Warrant"), which is attached as Exhibit A. Pursuant to the GPS 
 Warrant, the FBI has received GPS location data since approximately 10:15 p.m. on June 30, 2020 
 and has also historical cell site data for the Target Cellular Device for the period June 1, 2020 to 
 the present. That data shows that the Target Cellular Device is currently located in the District of 
 New Hampshire and has been located in the District of New Hampshire for the last 30 days. The 
 location data has allowed the FBI to identify approximately one square mile in which the Target 
 Cellular Device is located, but the location data is insufficiently specific to allow the FBI to 
 identify the particular building in which the Target Cellular Device is currently located. Pursuant 
 to Rule 41(b)(2), law enforcement may locate the Target Cellular Device outside the district 
 provided the device is within the district when the warrant is issued. 
 5. Based on the facts set forth herein, there is probable cause to believe that 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL has violated 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to entice minors to travel to 
 engage in illegal sex acts); 18 U.S.C. § 2422 (enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts); 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity); 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity); and 18 U.S.C. § 1623 (perjury). Specifically, on June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in 
 the Southern District of New York returned an indictment charging MAXWELL with these crimes,

 Subject: Re: - Epstein 
 Good afternoon, 
 It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday. In light of the recent filing and media reports, 
 EFTA00017856
which is attached as Exhibit B. That same day, United States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret 
 Smith signed an arrest warrant for MAXWELL, which is attached as Exhibit C. 
 6. There is also probable cause to believe that the Target Cellular Device's location 
 will assist law enforcement in arresting MAXWELL, who is a "person to be arrested" within the 
 meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c)(4). In particular, and as detailed below, 
 there is probable cause to believe that MAXWELL is the primary user of the Target Cellular 
 Device which remains active. The FBI does not know MAXWELL's current location and 
 accordingly requires the information sought in this application in order to locate and arrest 
 MAXWELL. 
 7. Because collecting the information authorized by this warrant may fall within the 
 statutory definitions of a "pen register" or a "trap and trace device," see 18 U.S.C. § 3127(3) & 
 (4), this warrant is designed to comply with the Pen Register Statute as well as Rule 41. See 18 
 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127. This warrant therefore includes all the information required to be included 
 in a pen register order. See 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(1). Consistent with the requirement for a pen 
 register order, I certify that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal 
 investigation by FBI. See 18 U.S.0 §§ 3122(b), 3123(b). 
 8. Consistent with the requirement for a pen register order, I certify that the 
 information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation by FBI. See 18 
 U.S.0 §§ 3122(b), 3123(b)." 
 PROBABLE CAUSE 
 9. Based on the following, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that 
 the Target Cellular Device's location will assist law enforcement in locating and arresting 
 MAXWELL pursuant to the arrest warrant described in paragraph 5, above. 
 3 
 EFTA00018666
10. As set forth in Exhibit A, United States Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker found 
 on June 30, 2020 that there is probable cause to believe that the location of the Target Cellular 
 Device will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. As set forth in paragraph 4 above, 
 that same day, the FBI received location information from AT&T revealing that the Target Cellular 
 Device is currently located in the District of New Hampshire and has been located in the District 
 of New Hampshire for at least the last 30 days. 
 II. Based on my review of Customs and Border Patrol records, I know that 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL is a United States citizen and that she most recently entered the United 
 States in or about June of 2019. There is no record of MAXWELL leaving the United States since 
 her arrival in June of 2019. 
 12. Based on my review of court filings, I am aware that GHISLAINE MAXWELL is 
 represented by counsel in multiple ongoing civil lawsuits in the United States. As recently as in 
 or about June 2020, attorney Laura Menninger appeared in in the Southern District of New York 
 for oral argument before United States District Judge Loretta A. Preska on MAXWELL's behalf. 
 13. Based on my review of AT&T records, I have learned that the Target Cellular 
 Device is subscribed in the name of "G Max," which appears to be a shortened version of 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL's name. 
 14. I further know from my review of AT&T records the following: 
 a. The Target Cellular Device has been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
 in the name of "Laura Menninger," which I know from my review of court records is the name of 
 an attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the "Laura 
 Menninger Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Laura 
 Menninger Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
 4 
 EFTA00018667
b. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed 
 to the business "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman," which I know from my review of court records is 
 the name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the 
 "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular 
 Device and the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
 c. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed 
 to in the name of "Isabel Maxwell," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database 
 is the name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the "Isabel Maxwell Phone"). The most recent 
 contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about 
 May 2020. 
 d. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed 
 to in the name of "Scott Borgerson," which I know from my review of bank records and Amazon 
 records is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank 
 account and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within 
 approximately the last year (the "Scott Borgerson Phone"). The most recent contact between The 
 Target Cellular Device and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about March 2020. 
 15. Accordingly, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the 
 location of the Target Cellular Device will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. 
 MANNER OF EXECUTION 
 16. In my training and experience, I have learned that cellular phones and other cellular 
 devices communicate wirelessly across a network of cellular infrastructure, including towers that 
 route and connect individual communications. When sending or receiving a communication, a 
 5 
 EFTA00018668
cellular device broadcasts certain signals to the cellular tower that is routing its communication. 
 These signals include a cellular device's unique identifiers. 
 17. To facilitate execution of this warrant to determine the location of the Target 
 Cellular Device, law enforcement may use an investigative device or devices capable of 
 broadcasting signals that will be received by the Target Cellular Device or receiving signals from 
 nearby cellular devices, including the Target Cellular Device. Such a device may function in 
 some respects like a cellular tower, except that it will not be connected to the cellular network and 
 cannot be used by a cell phone to communicate with others. The device may send a signal to the 
 Target Cellular Device and nearby cellular devices and thereby prompt them to send signals that 
 include the unique identifier of the device. Law enforcement may monitor the signals broadcast 
 by the Target Cellular Device for non-content signal information and use that information to 
 determine the Target Cellular Device's location, even if it is located inside a house, apartment, or 
 other building. The device will not intercept the contents of the Target Cellular Device's 
 communications, such as telephone calls, text messages, and other electronic communications. 
 Further, the device will not collect any other data stored on the Target Cellular Device, including 
 e -mails, text messages, contact lists, images, or Global Positioning System (GPS) data. 
 18. The investigative device may interrupt cellular service of phones or other cellular 
 devices within its immediate vicinity. Any service disruption to non-target devices will be brief 
 and temporary, and all operations will attempt to limit the interference with such devices. In order 
 to connect with the Target Cellular Device, the device may briefly exchange signals with all phones 
 or other cellular devices in its vicinity to determine whether those devices' unique identifiers match 
 the identifiers of the Target Cellular Device. These signals may include cell phone identifiers. 
 The device will not complete a connection with cellular devices determined not to be the Target 
 6 
 EFTA00018669
Cellular Device, and law enforcement will limit collection of information from devices other than 
 the Target Cellular Device. To the extent that any information from a cellular device other than 
 the Target Cellular Device is collected by the law enforcement device, law enforcement will delete 
 that information, and law enforcement will make no investigative use of it absent further order of 
 the court, other than distinguishing the Target Cellular Device from all other cellular devices. 
 AUTHORIZATION REQUEST 
 19. Based on the foregoing, I request that the Court issue the proposed search warrant, 
 pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41. The proposed warrant also will function as a 
 pen register order under 18 U.S.C. § 3123. 
 20. I further request, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b) and Federal Rule of Criminal 
 Procedure 41(0(3), that the Court authorize the officer executing the warrant to delay notice until 
 30 days from the end of the period of authorized surveillance. This delay is justified because 
 there is reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the warrant may have 
 an adverse result, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2705. Providing immediate notice to the subscriber 
 or user of the Target Cellular Device would seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation, as such 
 a disclosure would give that person an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of 
 behavior, and flee from prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b)(1). There is reasonable necessity 
 for the use of the technique described above, for the reasons set forth above. See 18 U.S.C. § 
 3103a(b)(2). 
 21. I further request that the Court authorize execution of the warrant at any time of 
 day or night, owing to the potential need to locate the Target Cellular Device outside of daytime 
 hours. 
 7 
 EFTA00018670
22. I further request that the Court order that all papers in support of this application, 
 including the affidavit and search warrant, be sealed until further order of the Court. These 
 documents discuss an ongoing criminal investigation that is neither public nor known to all of the 
 targets of the investigation. Accordingly, there is good cause to seal these documents because 
 their premature disclosure may seriously jeopardize that investigation. 
 23. A search warrant may not be legally necessary to compel the investigative 
 technique described herein. Nevertheless, I hereby submit this warrant application out of an 
 abundance of caution. 
 Respectfully Submitted, 
 Special Agent 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation 
 The affiant appeared before me by telephonic conference on this date pursuant to Fed. R. 
 Crim. P. 4.1 and affirmed under oath the content of this affidavit and application.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 Defendant. 
 X 
 SEALED 
 INDICTMENT 
 20 Cr. 
 20 Cr. 330 
 COUNT ONE 
 (Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
 Illegal Sex Acts) 
 The Grand Jury charges: 
 OVERVIEW 
 1. The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
 of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
 and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
 particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
 at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
 contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
 other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
 abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
 of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
 groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
 2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
 abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
 Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
 EFTA00018677
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
 intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
 sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
 MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
 including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
 herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 3. During the time periods charged in this 
 Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
 professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
 closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
 in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
 Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
 properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
 Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
 including in the below image: 
 2 
 EFTA00018678
4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
 engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
 means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
 a. MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
 Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
 asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
 families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
 friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
 victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
 involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
 victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
 time alone with a minor victim. 
 b. Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
 MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
 by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
 front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
 undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
 victim and Epstein. 
 c. MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
 interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
 minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
 Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
 was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
 3 
 EFTA00018679
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
 MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
 including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
 be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
 Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
 d. In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
 minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
 opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
 Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
 indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
 help them. 
 e. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
 enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
 some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
 sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
 the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
 5. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
 Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
 sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
 engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
 resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
 touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
 placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
 4 
 EFTA00018680
directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
 directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
 MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
 6. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
 about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
 Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
 things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
 inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
 were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
 following: 
 a. A a multi-story private residence on the 
 Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
 "New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
 photograph: 
 EFTA00018681
b. An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
 Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
 following photograph: 
 c. A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
 Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
 following photograph: 
 EFTA00018682
d. MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
 England. 
 7. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
 MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
 Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
 particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
 MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
 respect to minor victims: 
 a. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
 Victim -1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
 interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
 Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
 age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
 place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
 Victim -1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
 means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
 Victim -1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
 MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
 family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
 normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
 things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
 when Minor Victim-1 undressed ih front of Epstein. Within the 
 first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
 began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
 7 
 EFTA00018683
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
 involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
 During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
 Victim -1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
 MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
 residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
 Victim -1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
 Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
 lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
 MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
 Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
 properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
 b. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
 least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
 New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
 Victim -2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
 Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
 subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
 Victim -2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
 Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
 MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
 Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
 2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
 Victim -2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
 8 
 EFTA00018684
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
 Victim -2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
 massage Epstein. 
 c. MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
 Victim -3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
 including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
 Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
 MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
 Victim -3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
 arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
 Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
 Victim -3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
 in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
 Victim -3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
 during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
 MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
 Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
 Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
 of a sexualized massage. 
 MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
 8. In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
 as part of civil litigation,GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
 repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
 regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

INTRODUCTION 
 Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third 
 Motion for Release on Bail. 
 As Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no 
 intention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States 
 for 30 years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country. 
 She wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court 
 deems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the 
 25 -year -old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to 
 our knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her 
 appearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court's denial of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms. 
 Maxwell now proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily 
 restrictive bail package she has already offered. 
 • First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate 
 any opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires. 
 • Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse's assets—excluding funds 
 earmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to 
 defend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and 
 for taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal 
 District Court judge and former United States Attorney who will function as asset 
 monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account. 
 The former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed 
 insufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to 
 seek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at 11-13). As a non-citizen, Ms. 
 Maxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to 
 2 
 EFTA00018710
citizens of those countries. The latter condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell's assets so they 
 cannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should 
 satisfy the Court's concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets 
 unrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at 17-18). 
 In addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submitted twelve pretrial 
 motions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or 
 all of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail 
 application (see Dkt. 18 at 19) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the 
 chance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of 
 January 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government's case 
 against Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention. 
 Ms. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She 
 has been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has 
 poisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly 
 attacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have 
 neither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an attempt 
 to turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined — 
 and welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional 
 proposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should 
 therefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare 
 for trial. 
 3 
 EFTA00018711
I. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell's 
 Appearance in Court 
 As set forth above, Ms. Maxwell now proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate 
 any means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore 
 reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v. 
 Rowe, No. 02 CR. 756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) (IA] release 
 order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to 
 the movant at the time of the original hearing."); see also United States v. Petrov, No. 15-CR-66-
 LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting "Court's inherent authority for 
 reconsideration of the Court's previous bail decision"). 
 A. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship 
 To demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide 
 further assurance to the Court that she will not attempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is 
 willing to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should 
 the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submitted to the 
 appropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell's 
 passports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made. 
 If the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally 
 commence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the 
 process of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately 
 upon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate, 
 may be expedited. 
 Citizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell's decision to give up 
 citizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her 
 4 
 EFTA00018712
earnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to 
 fl ee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense. 
 Her renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court's concerns about the validity of 
 waivers of extradition. (See Dkt. 106 at 13). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest 
 extradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any 
 incentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries. 
 B. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets 
 In denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms. 
 Maxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could 
 be used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at 17-18). To assuage any concerns that 
 those assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell 
 has taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are 
 not used to secure the bond, while still allowing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for 
 her spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes. 
 1. New Account 
 All assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in 
 escrow for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in 
 the name of Ms. Maxwell's spouse ("the Personal Account")', will be deposited in a newly 
 created account ("the New Account") to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to 
 order of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell's and her spouse's 
 remaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale 
 1 The Personal Account is identified as Account Ion page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell's 
 Renewed Bail Application. (See Dkt. 97, Exhibit 0.) 
 5 
 EFTA00018713
of Ms. Maxwell's London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired. 
 The asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and 
 must approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of 
 disbursements for Ms. Maxwell's legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil 
 litigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization. No illiquid assets may 
 be sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor. 
 2. Other Assets 
 The only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (I) the money currently 
 held in escrow by Ms. Maxwell's attorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and 
 (2) the roughly $450,000 in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living 
 expenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal 
 Account, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive 
 five-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount 
 exceeding $5,000, and the reason for such payment. Ms. Maxwell's spouse agrees to be bound 
 by these restrictions and reporting requirements. 
 The asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or 
 disbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above. 
 3. Selected Asset Monitor 
 The Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the 
 former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the 
 position of asset monitor. (Judge Duffey's bio is attached as Exhibit A.) Judge Duffey has 
 extensive experience evaluating and monitoring funds held in and disbursed from financial 
 6 
 EFTA00018714
accounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her 
 spouse, as described above. 
 Restraining Ms. Maxwell's assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under 
 the supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds 
 could be used to violate the terms of release. 
 H. Ms. Maxwell's Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues 
 That Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her 
 In addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial 
 motions now before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government's case. 
 Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of 
 charges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the 
 superseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay, 
 and for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell's 
 constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of 
 the Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious 
 statements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These 
 motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government's case and warrant 
 granting bail on the conditions proposed. 
 III. The Court Should Grant Bail 
 Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant must be released on personal 
 recognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines "that such release 
 will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of 
 any other person or the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b). The enhanced bail package proposed 
 by Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably

assure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3142(e), 
 the Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if 
 released, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this 
 propensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what 
 conditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no 
 danger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To 
 say that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States 
 citizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for 
 alleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old 
 claims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.' 
 The additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package 
 previously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms. 
 Maxwell's presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral 
 pledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of 
 foreign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds 
 can be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and 
 former United States Attorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the 
 government and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly

 02526/201I(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a 
 Paris -bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including 
 felony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel 
 housekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn's DNA 
 on the accuser's uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $1 million cash, 24-
 hour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his 
 French passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a 
 residence in Manhattan. See https://www.theguardian.comAvorld/20  may/20/dominique-strauss-kahn-new-york-

affirm Ms. Maxwell's earnestness in seeking bail to properly prepare her defense, not to flee. 
 The Court should grant bail to Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 CONCLUSION 
 The proposed additional conditions of release—renunciation of foreign citizenship and 
 restraint and monitoring of assets by a retired District Court judge—enhance the already 
 extraordinarily restrictive bail conditions proposed in Ms. Maxwell's Renewed Motion for Bail. 
 In combination, these conditions satisfy the Bail Reform Act and reasonably assure Ms. 
 Maxwell's appearance at trial. To deny Ms. Maxwell bail when such extraordinary and 
 restrictive conditions are available would be a miscarriage of justice.

 To the 
 Department of Justice (D.O.J) 
 Through Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate on behalf of the 
 Embassy of the United States of America located in Paris, France 
 I hereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are 
 governed by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 Article 696-2 of said Code provides that: "The French government is able to remit to 
 foreign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a 
 lawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said 
 requesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic." 
 Article 694-4 expressly specifies as follows: 
 "Removal is not granted: 
 I - When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been 
 assessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being 
 requested." 
 WHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an 
 insuperable obstacle to his/her removal. As long as said nationality is assessed at the time the 
 offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent to said offense has no bearing upon 
 the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of nationality.

 Hey, 
 March 10 2021 6:31 PM 
 Would you mind sending us the briefing you guys did on not identifying the victims early in Epstein/ Maxwell? 
 The Justice Dept in Canada is requesting a "publication ban" which would stop defense counsel from identifying 
 victims in the extradition case and asked us for a letter. Obviously the posture is different but it would be helpful 
 to see what you highlighted.

 Dear Judge Nathan, 
 Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, pursuant to paragraph 18 of this Court's Protective Order (Doc. 
 # 36), requests that the Court enter an Order allowing her to refer to and file under seal in Giuffre 
 v. Maxwell, 15-cv-5433 (LAP), and a related Second Circuit appeal, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-
 2413 (the "Other Matters"), certain discovery materials produced by the government on August 
 5, 2020. She also seeks to refer to (but not file) discovery materials produced by the government 
 on August 13, 2020, specifically the 90,000 pages of documents received from Boies Schiller & 
 Flexner, which appears to include their entire civil file from the Giuffre case. 2
 Disclosure to the judicial officers in the Other Matters is necessary for fair determination of 
 important issues impacting the privacy and due process rights of Ms. Maxwell and other third 
 parties. The ten discrete items to be filed ("the Material") are not confidential and disclosure 
 confined to the Honorable Loretta Preska and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, under seal, 
 ' Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file this Letter Motion under seal because it relates and refers to 
 discovery materials deemed Confidential under the terms of the Protective Order in this case. 
 'Counsel for Ms. Maxwell have not conducted a document by document comparison of the 
 90,000 pages with documents in their possession related to the Maxwell civil matters but presumes they 
 are the same. Paragraph 16 of the Protective Order in this case exempts information obtained "from a 
 source other than the government." Because Ms. Maxwell has not yet compared the two sets of 
 documents she makes this request out of an abundance of caution.

 will not prejudice the government? The items to be referred to (and not filed) are confidential; 
 accordingly, referring to them under seal in the Other Matters will not prejudice the government. 
 Relevant Facts and Procedural History 
 The defamation action and its Protective Order- Giuffre v. Maxwell 
 In 2015, 'alleged in a civil suit that Ms. Maxwell defamed her, based on a 
 statement from Ms. Maxwell's attorney-hired press agent generally denying as "untrue" and 
 "obvious lies'as allegations that Ms. Maxwell participated in a scheme causing her to be 
 "sexually abused and trafficked" by Jeffrey Epstein. Given the amount of personal, confidential 
 material and information sought in discovery, the district court entered a stipulated Protective 
 Order protecting confidential information from public disclosure. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-
 7433 (Doc. # 62).4 The language agreed upon, and made an order of the district court, 
 specifically excluded an exception for law enforcement. Ms. Maxwell shortly thereafter 
 submitted to a deposition in reliance on the Protective Order; she also was compelled to — and 
 did — sit for a second deposition in July 2016. A year later and literally days before trial, the 
 parties agreed to a settlement of the defamation claim and the case was dismissed. 
 The Jane Doe 43 matter 
 On January 26, 2017, plaintiff Jane Doe 43 sued various individuals including Ms. Maxwell. A 
 Protective Order substantially similar to the Protective Order entered in Giuffre v. Maxwell was 
 entered by Magistrate Judge Netburn on November 29, 2018.5 That matter was settled and 
 dismissed on December 20, 2018. Jane Doe 43 also was represented by BSF, the same lawyers 
 who represent 
 The Materials to be filed are attached, under seal, as exhibits 1-10. Although marked by the 
 government as "Confidential," the Materials are not "Confidential" as that term has been defined by the 
 Second Circuit. They consist of ex pane pleadings filed by the government, ex pane transcripts, and ex 
 pane rulings. Boies, Schiller & Flexner ("BSF') lawyers, cooperating with the government, are aware of 
 the Material. The Second Circuit has characterized these types of documents as "judicial documents" with 
 a presumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 2019). Ms. Maxwell 
 objected to the government's Confidential designation, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order, and 
 requested that the government withdraw the designation. The Court does not need to decide the issue of 
 whether the Material is confidential at this time given that Ms. Maxwell seeks only to provide the 
 Material to judicial officers under seal as information necessary to fairly decide pending issues in those 
 cases. 
 4 Plaintiff originally proposed protective order language that would have allowed for a "law 
 enforcement" exception. In particular, Paragraph l(a)4 of the draft proposed that "CONFIDENTIAL 
 information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case and 
 any related matter, including but not limited to, investigations by law enforcement." See Giuffre v. 
 Maxwell, 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1078-4 at 4). Ms. Maxwell and her counsel rejected this proposed language 
 because of her concerns that plaintiff and her lawyers were acting as either express or de facto agents of 
 the government.

 The motion to unseal and the first appeal 
 One year after Giuffre v. Maxwell was dismissed and closed, the Miami Herald sought to reopen 
 the case and to unseal every sealed filing on the district court docket. The district court denied 
 the motion to unseal. The Miami Herald appealed on September 28, 2018. 
 On July 3, 2019 the Second Circuit reversed Judge Sweet's ruling. Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 
 41, 44-45 (2d Cir. 2019). Upon the issuance of the mandate, on August 9, 2019, it largely 
 unsealed the summary judgment materials to the public and the press and remanded the case to 
 the district court to conduct a particularized review of the remaining records. Id. at 53-54. 
 The remand and the unsealing process. 
 On July 9, the Giuffre case was assigned to the Honorable Loretta Preska who was charged with 
 the difficult and time consuming task of sorting through thousands of filings, determining what 
 documents were "judicial," what were not, determining the process to notify the hundreds of 
 non-parties about their right to object to the disclosure of their confidential information, and 
 implementing a protocol for maintaining or unsealing the sealed status of thousands of pages of 
 material. Judge Preska sought input from the various Does, the lawyers for primarily 
 Sigrid McCawley, a partner at BSF, and counsel for Ms. Maxwell. Judge Preska was obligated 
 by the Brown Court first to identify what was or was not a "judicial document"; second, to 
 determine the presumption of access to the document; and third, to identify and weigh numerous 
 factors for or against unsealing a judicial document. Since August 2019, this process has 
 consumed hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyer, court, and staff hours. 
 On July 23, 2020, Judge Preska, over Ms. Maxwell's objection, ordered the unsealing of her 
 April 2016 deposition transcript and the deposition transcript of John Doe 1. On July 30, 2020, 
 Ms. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit and an emergency motion with the 
 Second Circuit to stay the unsealing order pending appeal. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, 
 Doc. # 10 (2d. Cir.) (Maxwell Emergency Motion for Stay). When Judge Preska ordered the 
 unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's deposition on July 23 and denied Ms. Maxwell's motion to 
 reconsider on July 30, she apparently did not know that, as described below, Chief Judge 
 McMahon had already granted an ex pane request from the government to obtain Ms. Maxwell's 
 deposition (among thousands of other confidential and sealed materials that were protected under 
 the Protection Order from disclosures to non-parties) and that Magistrate Judge Netburn had 
 denied such a request from the government. Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys did not know 
 anything about the government's request for access to these materials. 
 On July 31, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed Judge Preska's order unsealing Ms. Maxwell and 
 John Doe 1's deposition transcripts. The Court ordered an expedited briefing schedule. Ms. 
 Maxwell's opening brief is due on August 20, 2020. Oral argument is September 22, 2020. 
 The Material 
 The government apparently contacted BSF at some time before February 2019 while the Second 
 Circuit appeal of Judge Sweet's order was pending. Based on some discussion with an as-yet 
 unidentified BSF lawyer, the government served BSF with a subpoena to produce (apparently) 
 all the BSF litigation files pertaining to both civil litigations. Ms. Maxwell was not served with 
 EFTA00018751
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 17, 2020 
 Page 4 
 any subpoena. According to the government, "although [BSF] would not otherwise contest 
 compliance with the Subpoena, [BSF] believe[d] that the Protective Order preclude[d] [BSF] 
 from complying." See Exhibits 1 at p. 2 II 3 and 2, q 5. 
 In or about February 28, 2019 the government first applied to Judge Sweet for relief. The 
 government pressed its request in late March 2019 to Chief Judge McMahon and in April to 
 Magistrate Judge Netburn. During these ex parte proceedings, the government made numerous 
 unchallenged factual assertions. To Ms. Maxwell's knowledge, no one disclosed the pendency of 
 these applications to any judicial officer associated with the appeal or the unsealing process. 
 Certainly, no one -- not the government, any court, or any lawyer at BSF -- disclosed to Ms. 
 Maxwell that, while the issues surrounding the unsealing of thousands of confidential documents 
 were being litigated in the Second Circuit, BSF and the government were secretly working 
 together to "modify" the Protective Orders so that the government could gain access to the 
 materials subject to the Protective Orders. 
 Over the last year, none of the filings submitted to any court involved in the sanctioned, public 
 unsealing process hints at the fact that, even though Ms. Maxwell and numerous Does were 
 contesting the release of the confidential information in the Second Circuit, BSF had already 
 turned over (apparently) all of the confidential information to the government, as well as all of 
 the discovery produced by Ms. Maxwell and numerous non-parties. Ms. Maxwell assumes that, 
 to this day, Judge Preska has never been told that the government was given all the material as 
 part of the Martindell-avoidance, ex pane processes in front of Judges Sweet, McMahon, and 
 Netbum. 
 The indictment with reference to sealed materials 
 On July 2, 2020, one day after Ms. Maxwell filed her Reply concerning the unsealing of 
 approximately 5,000 pages of material in the civil matter including her deposition, the 
 government arrested Ms. Maxwell. On July 8, the government filed a superseding indictment 
 alleging that Ms. Maxwell "assisted, facilitated, and contributed" to Epstein's abuse of minors. 
 Regarding the civil action, the indictment alleges that in 2016 Ms. Maxwell made "efforts to 
 conceal her conduct" by "repeatedly provid[ing] false and perjurious statements" in deposition 
 testimony. Superseding Indictment, Doc. # 17 at 29 II 8. 
 Ms. Maxwell first learned on August 7, 20206 how the government obtained the sealed 
 transcripts. On the two applications referenced above (one before Chief Judge McMahon and the 
 other before Magistrate Judge Netburn), the two SDNY courts rendered a split decision. Judge 
 McMahon, based on many ex pane, but soon to be challenged, factual assertions granted the ex 
 6 The first batch of discovery was provided by the government to NY counsel on August 5, 2020 
 in the late afternoon on a hard disk. Due to the time upload and securely transfer files, undersigned 
 counsel for Ms. Maxwell (also counsel for her in the Giuffre case) only received these materials at 11:38 
 a.m. on Friday, August 7, 2020. 
 EFTA00018752
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

 pane application. Magistrate Judge Netburn denied the application. Both courts reached different 
 results applying the same authority.' 
 Counsel for Ms. Maxwell then learned, on August 14, 2020, that BSF has produced 90,000 pages 
 of discovery from BSF, including their entire civil file comprised not only of sealed judicial 
 documents but all of the discovery produced by Ms. Maxwell and numerous non-parties in the 
 Giuffre case. As the Second Circuit has already held, much of the discovery was compelled, and 
 responses provided, based on the promise of confidentiality by the Giuffre Protective Order. See 
 Brown, 929 F.3d 41, n. 22 & 51. 
 The pressing issue that necessitates the filing of this request concerns Ms. Maxwell's due process 
 right to fairly litigate issues in the rapidly unfolding unsealing litigation and related appeal. 
 These issues, in turn, impact her rights as the accused in this matter, constitutionally presumed 
 innocent unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. 
 The Protective Order in this case 
 The Protective Order in this case prohibits the use of the discovery materials or confidential-
 designated materials "for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this 
 action" absent mutual agreement in writing between the government and defense counsel or if 
 "modified by further order of the Court." Doc. # 36 at 1(a), 10(a), 18. Ms. Maxwell agreed to 
 that limitation after assurances by the government, consistent with their representation to this 
 Court, that "the Government rarely provides any third party, including a witness, with any 
 material they did not already possess," and therefore "concerns defense counsel raises about 
 future use in civil litigation are not likely to occur." Letter of Alex Rossmiller at 6 (Doc. # 33) 
 (July 28, 2020). This Court relied on that representation in its ruling that government witnesses 
 should not be limited in their use of materials gained from the government in any related civil 
 litigation. Memorandum Op'n & Order at 3 (July 30, 2020). Yet as described above, the 
 government must have given a copy of the sealed order to BSF, BSF has now used that (or its 
 omission) to their tactical advantage in the Giuffre unsealing process, and Ms. Maxwell is unable 
 to respond to the judicial officers with the complete truth. 
 Paragraph 18 of the Protective Order permits modification by the Court. Further, any concerns 
 that the government may raise concerning their on-going grand jury investigation will be 
 obviated by submission of these materials under seal in the other matters. 
 The reasons this Court should grant the request 
 In contravention of Martindell and its progeny, the government achieved modification of a valid 
 protective order entered in connection with settled civil litigation. Knowing that significant 
 issues relating to the confidences and identities of multiple deponents and other innocents were 
 being actively litigated, it appears that the government worked in tandem with BSF to secretly 
 obtain tens of thousands of pages of confidential information, discovery, and sealed materials. 
 7 The controlling authority relied on by both courts to reach opposite results is Martindell v. 
 International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 1979). 
 EFTA00018753
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 17, 2020 
 Page 6 
 There are at least three compelling reasons to modify the Protective Order. First, Judge Preska 
 might well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell's depositions if she knew how the government 
 obtained it despite the Protective Order. We do not know what impact the government's 
 possession of the BSF file may have on the carefully crafted unsealing process. Judge Preska has 
 jurisdiction over the Protective Order entered in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case. Issues related to the 
 administration of that Protective Order should be litigated in that forum. There is a compelling 
 need for Ms. Maxwell to be able to advise Judge Preska about the Material so that she and the 
 non-parties can fairly adjudicate the multiple issues being addressed in the unsealing process. 
 Judge Preska might decide that disclosure to the government obviates the need for further 
 analysis of the remaining documents. 
 The partial secrecy surrounding the Material has also fundamentally undermined the fairness of 
 the adversarial process. Although the grand jury subpoena and government investigation were 
 known to opposing civil counsel BSF, they failed to move for a modification of the Protective 
 Order as contemplated by Martindell or disclose the material fact that these items had been 
 handed over to the government months ago. 
 Any suggestion that BSF's obligations regarding candor to the tribunal was somehow limited by 
 the Fed. R. Crim.P. 6(e) is misplaced. "The rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on 
 witnesses." Fed. R. Crim. P. 6, Advisory Committee Note to Subdivision 6(e)2. Indeed, 
 Martindell expressly contemplated that an affected party would have the ability to move to quash 
 any subpoena issued by a grand jury that would implicate his or her rights under a valid 
 protective order. Martindell, 524 F.2d at 294. Too many questions remain unanswered 
 including exactly what was said between the government and BSF, when was it said, and 
 precisely what was turned over. In the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation, certain orders entered by 
 Judge Sweet restricted certain information to "attorney eyes only." Without the ability to use the 
 Material in the very limited fashion proposed Ms. Maxwell she is unfairly disadvantaged in the 
 process. Moreover, instead of candidly revealing the fact of the subpoena and production, the 
 BSF lawyers misleadingly suggested to the courts that Ms. Maxwell's concerns about an 
 investigation were fabricated. 
 Second, following the revelation that the government had already obtained her deposition 
 through an ex parte proceeding, Ms. Maxwell moved Judge Preska to temporarily stay the 
 unsealing process. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1100). But because of the 
 Protective Order in this case, Ms. Maxwell could not inform Judge Preska of what she knew. On 
 August 12, Judge Preska denied the motion to stay, finding that: "Given that Ms. Maxwell is not 
 at liberty to disclose this new information because it is subject to the protective order in the 
 criminal action, . . . the Court has no reasonable basis to impose a stay." See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1103) Unless this Court modifies the Protective Order, Judge Preska will 
 continue to remain in the dark, and Ms. Maxwell will be deprived of a fair opportunity to seek a 
 stay of the unsealing process. The unsealing process in Giuffre is moving ahead to other 
 pleadings and exhibits, which include Ms. Maxwell's July 2016 deposition, also sealed and a 
 part of the indictment in this case. Without modification of this Protective Order, Ms. Maxwell 
 EFTA00018754
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 17, 2020 
 Page 7 
 will not be able to articulate her many concerns fully and fairly about the unsealing of that 
 deposition to Judge Preska. 
 Further, and as this Court knows, ample Second Circuit authority supports staying a civil case 
 pending the resolution of a related criminal case. See SEC v. Blaszczak, No. 17-CV-3919 (MN), 
 2018 WL 301091, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2018) (granting motion to stay civil case and holding 
 that "[a] district court may stay civil proceedings when related criminal proceedings are 
 imminent or pending, and it will sometimes be prudential to do so" (quoting Louis Vuitton 
 Ma!leder S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012))). Among other things, the stay 
 vindicates the Fifth Amendment and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil 
 case and then "conforming" their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the 
 civil case. This concern is all the more real when one law firm, BSF, is in possession of these 
 sealed materials representing accusers who may be witnesses in this case. The concern becomes 
 exponentially magnified when the accusers are purporting to recall and relate memories for 
 events that allegedly occurred decades ago, and their credibility will be a central challenge at the 
 criminal trial. 
 Ms. Maxwell further anticipates the very immediate need to disclose the Materials to the Second 
 Circuit Court of Appeals in connection with her appeal of Judge Preska's unsealing order, since 
 the appellate opening brief due on August 20, 2020. Again, disclosure is necessary to correct the 
 misleading statements of opposing counsel and to frame the issues related to the unsealing 
 orders. 
 Notably, the Material at issue is not accuser-related or sensitive in any regard. These ex parte 
 pleadings, hearings, and rulings are already known to the BSF lawyers. These materials, absent 
 sealing, would enjoy a presumptive right of public access as judicial documents. Given that the 
 Material has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court's 
 Order, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this 
 Court has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court's Protective 
 Order. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues 
 related to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion "that neither it 
 nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or 
 permissible in civil cases." Doc. # 33 at 7. What Ms. Maxwell asks is that she be allowed to 
 disclose, under seal, the Material so that she can advise the appropriate arbiters about 
 information already known to but not disclosed by her opponent. 
 The Protective Order in this case should not preclude judicial review by other Article III 
 judicial officers 
 The Material, as part of the court files in the United States District Court for the Southern 
 District of New York, may be judicially noticed by either Judge Preska or the Second Circuit 
 Court of Appeals. See FRE 201; Hong Mai Sa v. Doe, 406 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir. 2005) (the 
 Second Circuit Court of Appeals can take judicial notice of its own files as well as those of the 
 district court); In re Pruitt, 72 B.R. 436, 440 (Banks. E.D.N.Y. 1987) (a bankruptcy court may

 take judicial notice of the contents of its own files proceeding and the case in which an adversary

 The Protective Order restricts Ms. Maxwell from asking the Courts to exercise this authority or 
 direct the Courts to the applicable miscellaneous actions. Given that the appellate court and 
 district court are authorized to review, and are capable of reviewing, the Material it is illogical 
 and unjust that Ms. Maxwell be prohibited from referencing the Material in the civil litigation.

 Team, 
 As discussed, below is a summary of the efforts we have taken to learn how many times was 
 interviewed during the Florida investigation and to gather any record of such interview(s): 
 • AUSAs reviewed scans of full Florida FBI file on Relativity. From that review, we identified handwritten notes and 
 302 reflecting a single interview occurring on or about August 7, 2007 with Florida FBI agents. 
 • AUSAs and paralegals reviewed scans of full SDFL file on Relativity. From that review, we identified no record of any 
 additional interviews with la. 
 • AUSAs conducted a keyword search of AUSA email inbox, which included the search terms "Jane Doe," 
 a," and a". From that review, we identified no record of any additional interviews with 
 • AUSAs asked how many times she recalled being interviewed by the FBI in Florida. indicated 
 that she could not recall whether she met with the Florida agents once or twice. AUSatook notes 
 memorializing that statement. 
 • AUSAs asked SA how many times she recalled interviewing could not 
 recall specifically whether was interviewed any additional times after the August 7, 2007 interview. 
 indicated that follow-up interviews may not have been documented unless a witness made a new or 
 different statement during the interview(s). AUSAC took notes memorializing that statement. 
 • AUSA emailed her contact who had facilitated SDNY's review of the SDFL Epstein file to ask whether SDFL is 
 aware of any additional interviews conducted with AUSA has not yet heard back.
