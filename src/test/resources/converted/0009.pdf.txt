 I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I 
 had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact 
 with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was 
 asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He 
 wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch 
 area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with 
 his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

Good afternoon, 
 Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit until we 
 can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will be seen by 
 Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court 
 and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In 
 that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
 There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side of our 
 building and in front of the court house which is less then 100 yards apart from each other. 
 If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me. 
 Thank you

 MEMORANDUM FOR FILE 
 METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER 
 FROM: =NS 
 SUBJECT: Inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054 
 This memorandum is in regards of inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054. On 
 August 9, 2019, I spoke with inmate Epstein concerning him making a call to his family. I told 
 inmate Epstein I was leaving the facility around 7:00 p.m. Inmate Epstein agreed to shorten his 
 attorney visitation to make his social call. I escorted inmate Epstein to Special Housing Unit 
 around 7:00 p.m. I placed inmate Epstein in the shower on (G) Tier and escorted the phone for 
 him to make a social call. I placed the phone in the first jack to the left on G tier. Inmate Epstein 
 explain to me that he didn't have his phone set up to use his Pac and Pin number. I asked inmate 
 Epstein who he was calling, he stated his mother. I remember dialing a number starting with 347, 
 but the number was note notated. Inmate Epstein began talking on the phone. I told the staff to 
 end inmate Epstein's call after 15 minutes. They complied.

 I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to 
 visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report 
 any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general 
 population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a 
 speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were 
 no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the Special 
 Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate Epstein, Jeffrey, 
 Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the 
 inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The inmate was 
 placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While 
 on watch, the inmate indicated that his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been 
 harassing him and he had informed his Attorney of this matter. 
 Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the Physician 
 Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
 He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical encounter. 
 Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on his neck. 
 Responded: "I don't know". 
 He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
 He does not look in any distress or pain. 
 Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
 circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this erythema 
 in the front with marks of friction. 
 No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
 moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies any 
 respiratory problem. 
 Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild). 
 Psychologist Assessment: He was evaluated on today at 9:10 a.m., and it has been 
 determined he will remain on Suicide Watch for further observation. 
 Current Status: At this time, we are reviewing his case for placement in the general 
 population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

 As I was doing the 10:00 PM count, I notice this inmate distraught sad and a little confused. I asked him if he was ok? he 
 said, "that he's ok." but I am not convinced because he seems dazed and withdrawn. So just to be on the safe side 
 and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him. I don't know the inmate register 
 number because he is new, he is currently on 5 North. I don't know who did his in take, so I am not familiar with 
 any information on this inmate.

 He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he 
 only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner. 
 Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that 
 again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to 
 Mr. about the toilet.

 Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
 He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse saw him. 
 He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has 
 numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
 He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the 
 toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

 FROM: The Office of the General Counsel Federal Bureau of Prisons 
 Supervisory CLC Attorney EMAIL: DRESS: 150 P New or 
 NEW YORK NY 10007 RE: Obligation to Preserve Records and Electronically Stored 
 Information in INMATE DEATH, LHN-CIV-2019-00204 
 The BOP and its employees are required to preserve any potentially relevant 
 information pertaining to 
 EFTA00035286
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 6:30 am, EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 76318-
 054, was found unresponsive in his cell in conjunction with an apparent suicide, 
 and, subsequently, pronounced dead at the local hospital. No lawsuit has been filed 
 yet, but one is anticipated. 
 In this case, relevant information includes, but is not limited to: 
 Please preserve all electronic files (e.g. emails, Word documents, TRUSCOPE 
 entries, videos, BEMR records) and all handwritten or other physical documents 
 pertaining to inmate Epstein. 
 You have been identified as an individual likely to have information relevant to 
 this matter. Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to preserve any such 
 information in your possession, custody, or control even if it otherwise would be 
 destroyed, deleted or overwritten, in the normal course of Agency operations. 
 Knowingly altering, editing, or deleting potentially relevant information could 
 result in court-ordered sanctions against the BOP and/or employment action 
 against staff. 
 Electronically stored information (ESI) includes all information stored in any 
 digital medium, including the BOPA's computer network, any PCs, laptop computers, 
 all back-up media, email, calendars, word processing documents, scanned documents, 
 spreadsheets, photos and drafts. 
 DO NOT DISCARD OR DESTROY ANY RECORDS (ELECTRONICALLY STORED OR OTHERWISE) 
 RELATING TO THIS MATTER. 
 Action Required: 
 1.  Complete the attached Custodian Document Search Checklist and return to 
 by 08/21/2019. 
 2. Preserve Relevant Information 
 a. Do not alter, edit, delete, or otherwise destroy potentially relevant 
 information in either paper or digital documents. All auto-deletion 
 functions should be turned off and any retention policy should be 
 suspended if execution would cause the loss of potentially relevant 
 information. Do not move or alter electronic documents as this will 
 modify the metadata. Should you need to work on a relevant document, 
 please save it as a new version and edit the new version. 
 b. Do not transfer any potentially relevant information to a 
 Federal Records Center (FRC) or any other location. 
 c. Notify me of any potentially relevant information that is in the 
 process of being or has been sent to an offsite storage facility 
 (FRC or any other offsite facility). 
 3. Contact me if there are any staffing changes in your office that affect 
 this matter (e.g., retirement, transfer, etc.). 
 4. If you are aware of the loss of any potentially relevant ESI, notify me 
 immediately. 
 5. This document is privileged and confidential. 
 DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE THIS NOTICE WITH ANYONE.

 A 
 I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. Ill be coming in tomorrow before his Legal 
 visit to see him again. 
 He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom 
 breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
 He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because 
 of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

 2. REFERENCE: Program Statement 6031.01, Health Services Manual, dated January 15, 2005, Drug 
 Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulatory controls relating to registration, security and record 
 keeping of institutions having a narcotic treatment program. Institutional Supplement 6501.5(A), is 
 rescinded. 
 3. INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Director will establish guidelines for evaluation and treatment of 
 inmates who require detoxification from mood and mind altering substances such as alcohol, opiates, 
 hypnotics, sedatives, etc. 
 The guidelines will include specific detoxification protocols to be implemented upon order of medical 
 staff. Treatment and supportive measures will permit withdrawal with minimal physiological and 
 physical discomfort. 
 Metropolitan Correctional Centers, Metropolitan Detention Centers, Federal Transportation Centers and 
 jail units may provide methadone detoxification if clinically indicated. This program requires special 
 registration. If an institution has a methadone detoxification program then the institution Chief 
 Pharmacist will complete and maintain registration for a methadone program. Methadone is permitted to 
 be administered or dispensed only for detoxification or temporary treatment of patients. If Methadone is 
 administered for treatment of heroin dependence, for more than three weeks, the procedure passes from 
 treatment of the acute withdrawal syndrome (detoxification) to a maintenance program. 
 This institution has the authority to conduct only a detoxification program by the Food and Drug 
 Administration and has been assigned an identification number. Detoxification suppresses major 
 physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Each inmate possibly needing 
 detoxification will be evaluated by the physician for an appropriate detoxification schedule. 
 4. DEFINITIONS:
 A. The following are the definitions of terminology used in discussing detoxification: 
 EFTA00035317
0 
 1. DRUG - A chemical compound or biological substance producing a physiologic effect 
 when taken internally. 
 2. ABUSE OR DRUG ABUSE - The use of a drug for non-medical reasons. Typically this 
 use is to satisfy an addiction or habituation or for altering ones perception. 
 3. ADDICTION - physical dependency on a drug with a characteristic withdrawal or 
 abstinence syndrome, leading to chronic use, including narcotics, barbiturates, etc. 
 4. HABITUATION - Psychologic dependency on a drug leading to chronic use. 
 5. NARCOTIC - A natural or synthetic opiate drug for pain relief which in increasingly 
 larger doses produces dependency. Also, an addictive group of drugs including heroin, 
 morphine, methadone, etc. 
 6. ALCOHOL - Ethyl alcohol in water solution. 
 5. PROGRAM PARTICIPATION:. Inmates on detoxification will not be hospitalized unless deemed 
 necessary by medical staff. The medication will be administered on the units by medical staff. The 
 physician is to determine the need based on the history, clinical findings, and verification of any 
 Methadone Maintenance Program the inmate may have been enrolled in. The physician must document 
 this information on the chronological record of medical care. 
 6. CLASSIFICATIONS: 
 A. At this facility the classification for treatment includes: 
 1. All inmates committed with a history of alcohol use or physical findings indicating 
 dependency. 
 2. All inmates committed with a history of drug use or physical findings indicating 
 dependency. 
 3. All inmates discovered to be drug or alcohol dependent during the course of their 
 incarceration. 
 7. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES: 
 A. Subjective: 
 Subjective withdrawal complaints - presence or absence of: bone and muscle pain, nausea and/or 
 vomiting (subjective if not observed), diarrhea. 
 B. Objective: 
 EFTA00035318
1. Pulse, blood pressure, temperature; 
 2. Presence or absence of: Yawning, restlessness, lacrimation, dilated pupils, hyperactive 
 bowel sounds, skin - goose flesh, sweating, jaundice, tracks; 
 3. Liver size and presence or absence of tenderness 
 4. Verify patient participation in a MMTP. (Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program). 
 5. Urinary Dip Stick screening test for Opiates and Methadone 
 6. Order RPR test for Syphillis screening 
 C. Assessment: 
 1. It is the responsibility of all medical staff to identify all inmates who are or may be drug 
 dependent by taking a thorough medical history, including a drug history and the 
 performance of a complete physical examination as a part of the inmate intake screening 
 process. 
 2. Inmates diagnosed as having either alcohol or drug dependency should be enrolled in the 
 following protocol at this facility. 
 a. Be seen by the medical doctor as soon as possible for determination of: 
 1. Diagnosis 
 2. Medical orders including pharmacologic support if deemed necessary. 
 3. Special precautions to ensure inmate and staff security. 
 3. After an inmate has been evaluated for methadone detoxification, he or she may be: 
 a. Only observed because history and physical do not support the need for 
 detoxification. These patients will have: 
 1. Poor history for drug use/withdrawal; 
 2. No subjective findings; 
 3. No tracks; or 
 4. The inmate decides he or she does not want detoxification. 
 b. Placed on continued observation because subjective and objective findings 
 suggest that, though unlikely, it is possible that the inmate will undergo 
 withdrawal. Because the length of time between arrest and evaluation for 
 methadone detoxification can be in excess of 48 hours, inmates may often fail to 
 exhibit the objective signs of opiate withdrawal. The subjective component of the 
 opiate withdrawal syndrome, however, persists for up to ten days. Inmates who 
 have a history of drug addiction, have evidence of recent drug use (old/new 
 tracks), and complain of the subjective symptoms should not be placed on 
 EFTA00035319

 d. 
 continued observation, but should be placed on the 
 Program. 
 Placed on 7-Day Detoxification because subjective 
 consistent with acute withdrawal (see above). 
 Methadone Detoxification 
 and/or objective findings are 
 Placed on 21 -Day Detoxification schedule because the inmate was on a verified 
 MMTP•. If the program cannot be verified at the time of evaluation, the inmate 
 will be started on 7-Day Detoxification whether or not he or she shows drug 
 withdrawal signs. When the program is confirmed, the inmate should be 
 reexamined and seen by the Clinical Director to determine whether or not he or 
 she should be continued on the 7-Day schedule.

 EFTA00035320
D. PLAN 
 1. For inmates who decide they do not want detoxification, a refusal for treatment form must 
 be signed. 
 2. For inmates who will receive methadone (seven or 21 day schedules): 
 a. Record the information on which the decision was made on the progress note or 
 intake physical form. If the inmate is on a MMTP and automatically gets 
 methadone, this should also be recorded on the progress note or intake form. 
 b. Write and sign the order for a methadone 7 or 21-day schedule, whichever is 
 applicable, on the medication order sheet (duplicate form). All mid-level 
 practitioner orders must be countersigned by a physician prior to administration 
 (or a physician telephone order taken). 
 c. All methadone patients should be given their first dose at the time of intake. Fill 
 out the 7-day form and indicate date and time given as day one. If given on the 
 next date as a day two. If patient is verified on MMTP, the 2I-day schedule 
 should begin. 
 d. If a patient is a late court return, stat medications should be administered. 
 e. If a patient is verified on a MMTP dosage lower than our 21-day schedule (less 
 than 40 mg) the lower dosage should be maintained until the next scheduled 
 change, e.g., patient maintained on 30 mg. An order should be written to start 
 methadone 21-day detoxification on 30 mg. All higher doses on the 
 Administration Record should be crossed-out and replaced with "30 mg." It still 
 remains a 21-day detoxification schedule. 
 f. There are patients who have been on very long term MMTP programs. These 
 patients should be evaluated by the Clinical Director or detoxification specialist 
 for determination of possibly lengthening the detoxification process on an 
 individualized basis. 
 g. 
 Make appointment for the patient to see a psychologist for counseling. 
 h. If a patient is on methadone detoxification (7 or 21-day) and confirmation of 
 pregnancy is established by both urine and gynecological examination, the patient 
 has the option to either detoxify or be maintained on a dosage level to be 
 determined by the Clinical Director until completion of pregnancy and/or 
 discharge. 
 I. If patient is discharged during the course of pregnancy, a psychologist should be 
 called to help counseling. 
 It should be explained to the patient that pregnant opiate users are to be 
 maintained on low doses of methadone after the first trimester. Detoxification can 
 possibly cause damage to the fetus.

 Institution Supplement 
 OPI: Psychology Department 
 NUMBER: NYM5324.08d 
 DATE: May 2I , 2013 
 SUBJECT: Suicide Prevention Program 
 1. PURPOSE: The prevention of self-destructive behavior is an essential component in the care, custody, 
 and control of the inmate population. The procedures outlined below will be implemented to avert the 
 loss of life, and to diminish the potential for further suicidal behavior. 
 The stress associated with incarceration, as well as unpredictable stressful events, can result in the 
 motivation to commit suicide. Early identification of self-destructive potential in conjunction with 
 appropriate physical and mental health interventions and coordinated follow-up can reduce the 
 likelihood of injury, fatality, and further self-destructive behavior. 
 2. DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: 
 Directive Referenced: 
 P.S. 5324.08 Suicide Prevention Program. dated April 5, 2007. 
 Directive Rescinded: 
 NYM 5324.05c, Suicide Prevention Program, dated December I. 2006. 
 3. RESPONSIBILITIES: The Chief Psychologist or his/her designee is designated as the Suicide 
 Prevention Program Coordinator. 
 4. PROCEDURES: 
 A. REFERRAL: All staff shall immediately refer potentially suicidal inmates to Psychology 
 Services for evaluation. During non-regular working hours, the inmate will be referred to the 
 Operations Lieutenant and the Physician's Assistant on duty. Should the Physician's Assistant 
 determine that the inmate is at serious risk for inflicting self-harm, he/she will inform the 
 EFTA00035323
ca. 
 NYM.5324.08d 
 Suicide Prevention Program 
 Operations Lieutenant, who in turn, will contact the On-Call Psychologist who will determine if 
 a suicide watch will be initiated. However, in an emergency situation if a Physician's Assistant 
 is not available, any staff member can initiate a suicide watch. The Operations Lieutenant should 
 immediately be contacted, who will then immediately contact the On-Call Psychologist. 
 I 
 Psychology Services Inmate Questionnaire (PSIQ): This form (attachment 1) will be distributed in 
 Receiving and Discharge during the intake screening process. Staff (Medical, Psychology, or 
 Lieutenants) conducting the psychosocial interview will review the PSIQ for completion, check the 
 inmate's response to item #7, i.e., "Are you considering suicide now?" and sign his/her name next to item 
 #7. 
 Outside of regular working hours and in the absence of any Psychologist at the institution, without 
 exception, all inmates endorsing item #7 (current suicidal thoughts) or appearing to be potentially 
 suicidal as determined by the staff member conducting the psychosocial interview, will be placed 
 on suicide watch, pending direct interview by a Psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant will be 
 contacted immediately and he/she will in turn notify the Psychologist as soon as possible about the new 
 suicide watch. In the rare case the On-Call psychologist cannot be reached promptly, reasonable efforts 
 should be made to contact another Psychologist. If there is a mid-level provider or Physician Assistant 
 at the institution during non-routine hours, he/she will be called for further evaluation if the inmate 
 endorses item #7, appears highly emotionally distressed, and/or displays unusual behavior (e.g., crying, 
 shaking, talking to himself, paranoid, etc.). 
 During routine working hours, the "duty psychologist" will be called immediately by radio for further 
 evaluation of any inmate who endorses item #7, appears highly emotionally distressed, and/or displays 
 unusual behavior. Referred inmates should be kept under direct observation of staff  until the 
 Psychologist arrives. 
 B. MAINTENANCE: When a suicide watch is initiated, the suicidal inmate will be placed under 
 continuous visual observation. The following maintenance procedures will be followed: 
 When there is an inmate in the institution placed on a suicide watch, the suicide 
 watch will be in the 2nd floor suicide prevention area and conducted by inmate 
 companions, unless staff are required for the suicide watch. If staff are used for the 
 suicide watch, there are Post Orders explaining the suicide watch procedures in 
 detail that must be signed by all staff before they assume this post. Inmate 
 companions may only watch suicidal inmates of the same gender. The Unit 2 
 Officer is responsible for making rounds and signing the suicide watch log every 
 hour. 
 FXCEPTIONS; The following exceptions to the above procedures will apply: 
 2 
 4 
 EFTA00035324
I 
 I 
 NYM.5324.08d 
 Suicide Prevention Prognun 
 1. All Unit 3 inmates placed on a suicide watch will be observed only on Unit 3 
 (cell C02-313) by Unit 3 inmate companions or staff only. 
 2. If a suicide watch is being conducted in the 2nd floor suicide prevention area, 
 an inmate of the opposite gender will not be placed on suicide watch in the 2nd 
 fl oor suicide prevention area. The suicide watch with an inmate of the opposite 
 gender will be conducted in an alternate location. See #3 below for the alternate 
 locations. Therefore, if there is a male inmate on suicide watch in the suicide 
 prevention area and a female inmate suicide watch is initiated, the female 
 inmate will be placed on Unit 2 (cell B01-211) with a female inmate 
 companion. If there are two female inmates on suicide watch in the suicide 
 prevention area and a male inmate suicide watch is initiated, the male inmate 
 will be placed on 9 South (Z03-965, H tier, Hard cells #1, #2) on suicide watch 
 with a staff member watching the inmate. 
 3. A suicide watch room waiver has been approved for alternate suicide watch 
 rooms when needed other than the 2 suicide watch rooms in the suicide 
 prevention area. They are as follows: Unit 2 (cell B01-211), Unit 3 (cell C02-
 313), 9 South (cell Z03-965), and 10 South Lower — H tier (Hard cells #1 and 
 #2). 
 C. OPERATIONAL
 1. Suicide Watch Requirements: Before placing a suicidal inmate in a suicide watch 
 room, the room will be thoroughly inspected and the inmate will be strip-searched to 
 ensure that he/she does not have access to any items which could be used to injure 
 him/herself or others. Normally potentially suicidal inmates will be required to wear a 
 suicide watch gown. Unless otherwise specified by the Program Coordinator or her 
 designee, the inmate will be allowed a suicide watch blanket. The inmate will never be 
 allowed razors, shoelaces, belts, sheets, metal cans, or other sharp objects. In the 
 suicide watch log book, there will be a list specifying items that the inmate may be 
 allowed in the suicide watch room, as well as any special instructions for the 
 management of the inmate on watch. 
 2. Monitoring and Psychological Interviews of Inmates on Suicide Watch: All 
 inmates on Suicide Watch must be observed directly by staff or inmate companions at 
 ALL TIMES. If inmate companions need to be removed from their Suicide Watch 
 posts for any reason, a staff member will immediately assume the Suicide Watch post in 
 order to continue direct observation of the inmate in the suicide watch cell. It is a fact, 
 as reiterated by national policy; it takes only three to four minutes for many suicide 
 deaths to occur. A Psychologist will interview the inmate on suicide watch daily, 
 3 
 EFTA00035325
o 
 NYM.5324.08d 
 Suicide Prevention Program 
 including weekends and holidays, and record clinical notes on the Psychology Data 
 System (PDS) following each visit. 
 1 
 3. Documentation of Observations of Inmates on Suicide Watch: Observations of the 
 inmate's behavior will be documented in a Suicide Watch Log Book, which will be 
 maintained as a secure document. As stated by the Suicide Prevention Program 
 Statement, staff and inmate observers will document in separate log books. Post Orders 
 will provide direction to staff on requirements for documentation (e.g., entering log 
 entries at least every 15 minutes). 
 4. Meats: Inmates on suicide watch will be fed sack meals to prevent their access to hard, 
 breakable objects, hard containers, and plastic wrappings. 
 5. Showers: Showers are allowed for inmates on suicide watch unless specific mental 
 health or security concerns are identified by Psychology Services or Correctional 
 Services. The Operations Lieutenant will be responsible for supervising and 
 coordinating showering procedures. Any showering restrictions, due to security 
 concerns, must be directly conveyed to the Operations Lieutenant. Receipt of such 
 instructions will be noted in the Suicide Watch Log Book. 
 6. Searches of Suicide Watch Cells: At a minimum, suicide watch cells will be searched 
 once a day, to extract any contraband, items not allowed in the cell, and/or accumulated 
 trash. This search will normally be conducted by the Unit Officer during Day Watch, 
 supervised by the Operations Lieutenant or designee. The Unit Officer will also search 
 the suicide watch cell when the inmate exits the cell to take a shower. 
 7. Telephone Use: Inmates on suicide watch will not normally be permitted phone calls. 
 Very seldom, phone calls may be recommended by Psychology Services staff as these 
 phone calls may be deemed potentially beneficial to the inmate's mental health and/or 
 may expedite recovery, and do not pose an increased risk for self-harm or harm to 
 others. These rare exceptions must be approved by the Captain as well by the Associate 
 Warden of Programs. Non-psychology staff recommending phone calls shall consult 
 with Psychology Services staff, who if in agreement, will initiate proper procedures. 
 8. Visits and Recreation: Normally, neither recreation nor visitation (either social or 
 legal) are permitted for inmates on suicide watch. Occasionally, visits may be 
 recommended by Psychology Services staff, as these visits may be deemed potentially 
 beneficial to the inmate's mental health and/or may expedite recovery, and do not pose 
 an increased risk for self-harm or harm to others. These rare exceptions must be 
 approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Wardens of Programs.

 Suicide Prevention Program 
 9. Emergency Medical Trips: Emergency medical trips will be the responsibility of the 
 Operations Lieutenant. 
 10. Court Trips: Court trips do not require approval from a Psychologist. Therefore, 
 ordinarily, all inmates on suicide watch scheduled to go to court must be escorted to 
 R&D to go to court. It will be the Operations Lieutenant's responsibility to notify the 
 U.S. Marshals Service of any inmate on suicide watch who is scheduled to go to court. 
 Any exceptions regarding inmates on suicide watch who are not permitted to go to court 
 (i.e., actively suicidal and/or acutely psychotic), will be stated in writing by Psychology 
 Services and/or Correctional Services. Every inmate who departs for court on suicide 
 watch must be placed back on suicide watch upon returning to the institution, pending 
 re-evaluation by a Psychologist. 
 11. Escorting Procedures for Inmates on Suicide Watch: All inmates on suicide watch 
 will be restrained when moved out of the suicide watch cell for showering, medical 
 visits, court appearances, or legal visits. The level or type of restraints will be 
 determined by Correctional Services. 
 12. Termination of Suicide Watches: Once an inmate has been placed on suicide watch, 
 the watch may not be terminated, under any circumstance, without a Psychologist 
 performing a face-to-face evaluation. Upon termination of a suicide watch, the 
 Psychologist will provide the Operations Lieutenant with a memorandum documenting 
 the ending of the watch and requesting removal of the inmate from the watch cell. 
 13. Housing Procedures for Inmates Discharged from Suicide Watch. All inmates 
 discharged from suicide watch to a general population unit or the Special Housing Unit 
 will be assigned a cellmate. If security and/or safety concerns preclude cellmate 
 assignment, the Associate Warden of Programs will be contacted by the staff member 
 recommending against cellmate assignment. 
 The above procedures are to be strictly adhered to. Any deviation from established 
 procedures must first be approved by the Associate Warden Operations and/or Programs. 
 D. INMATE COMPANIQNS: The Program Coordinator will be responsible for the selection, 
 training, assignment and removal of individual inmate companions. The following guidelines 
 will be required for the use of inmate companions: 
 1. Male volunteers will be recruited from the sentenced inmates designated to Unit 5S 
 and, if needed, pretrial/holdover inmates without separatees from 5 North. Male 
 volunteers for the suicide watches on Unit 3 will be recruited from the Unit 3 inmates. 
 Female volunteers will be recruited from inmates on Unit 2. All volunteers must be 
 approved in advance by the Program Coordinator, who will consult with Unit 2, Unit 3, 
 Unit 5S and Unit 5N Unit Managers. 
 5 
 EFTA00035327

 Suicide Prevention Program 
 I 
 I 
 I
 2. There will be one inmate companion designated as the Inmate Coordinator on Unit 5S 
 and one designated as an Alternate Inmate Coordinator, either on Unit 5S or Unit 5N. 
 There will be one inmate companion designated as the Inmate Coordinator on Unit 2. 
 The Inmate Coordinator is responsible for maintaining a current schedule of round-the-
 clock inmate companion assignments. Daily changes and additions will be maintained 
 by the Inmate Coordinator. On Unit 3 there will be only 6 inmate companions and each 
 one will be assigned a permanent 4-hour shift. The Inmate Companion schedule will be 
 available to the Operations Lieutenant and the Unit 5S, Unit 5N, Unit 3, and Unit 2 
 Officers at all times. 
 3. Once a suicide watch has been initiated, the Operations Lieutenant will contact the Unit 
 5S, Unit 3, or Unit 2 Officer/Unit Staff to inform them that inmate companions will be 
 used. The Inmate Coordinator will then be notified by the Unit Officer and told to 
 inform all inmate companions of their assigned shifts for the next 24 hours. The Inmate 
 Coordinator will then maintain round-the-clock assignments of inmate companions for 
 as long as the suicide watch remains in effect. If an inmate companion refuses to work 
 or cannot work his/her shift because of illness, the Inmate Coordinator is responsible 
 for providing a replacement. If the Inmate Coordinator does not fulfill his/her 
 responsibility in assigning inmate companions, the Operations Lieutenant will make the 
 assignments. 
 4. Inmate companions will receive one dollar for each hour they monitor a suicide watch 
 and forty cents for each hour they attend training classes. Payment will be made on a 
 monthly basis. Hours worked and training sessions attended will be recorded by the 
 Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. 
 5. Inmate companions will be required to work their regular 8-hour work details in 
 addition to their 4-hour suicide watch shift. Whenever possible, inmate companions 
 will not be scheduled for a suicide watch during their regular work details. If unusual 
 circumstances result in a conflict between an inmate companion's suicide watch and his 
 work detail, then Unit 5S, Unit 5N or Unit 2 Officer will notify the Detail Supervisor of 
 the reason for the inmate's absence. 
 E. STAFF TRAINING: The Program Coordinator will ensure that all staff will be trained by 
 psychology services personnel to recognize signs indicative of a potential suicide, the appropriate 
 referral process, and suicide prevention techniques. At a minimum, this will occur during 
 Annual Training. 
 1. Supplemental Specialty Training - Further training with regard to suicide prevention 
 will ordinarily be conducted with Health Services staff, Lieutenants, and Connectional 
 Counselors approximately six months after Annual Training.

 EFTA00035328
NYM.5324.08d 
 Suicide Prevention Program 
 Supplemental Training for SHU Staff - Information about recognizing potentially 
 suicidal inmates and procedures to follow will be included in the SHU post orders with 
 a separate signature sheet. 
 Emergency Response Training - As indicated by the Suicide Prevention Program 
 Statement, the Captain and the Chief Psychologist will conduct three joint mock 
 exercises yearly, one on each shift, approximately four months apart. At least one of 
 these exercises will take place in the SHU during the evening or morning watch. 
 Ordinarily, this exercise will be coordinated between the Captain, and/or Emergency 
 Preparedness Officer and the Chief Psychologist.

 MEMORANDUM 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York 
 DATE: April I 
 TO: arden, MCC New York 
 FROM: 'hief Psyc ologi , CC New York 
 THRU: ssociate Warden, Programs, MCC New York 
 SUBJECT: RESUBMITTAL OF PROCEDURAL MEMORANDUM FOR 
 PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION 
 The original Procedural memorandum for Psychological Observation was initially submitted on July 20, 
 2005 to the Warden and through the Associate Warden of Programs. The procedures outlined below 
 have been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmitted as revisions 
 have been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary. 
 I. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), 
 New York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status. 
 2. DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a 
 mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental 
 status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate 
 is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
 population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological 
 observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal 
 (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to 
 his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
 disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
 Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until 
 such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in 
 general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
 inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
 3. PROCEDURES: The following are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation: 
 A. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an 
 inmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an 
 inmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological 
 Observation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff 
 (i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food 
 Service Administrator, and Duty Officer. 
 B. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not 
 feasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The 
 inmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a 
 EFTA00035330
. 0 6 
 staff member. 
 C. An inmate on Psychological Observation status is allowed only items indicated by a 
 Psychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate's psychological observation log 
 book. The suicide watch mattress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on 
 psychological observation. 
 D. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every 15 
 minutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but observation of 
 the inmate is continuous. 
 E. When the observation is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will 
 make hourly rounds and sign the log book. 
 F. A Lieutenant and Physician Assistant will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log 
 book. 
 G. On a daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological Observation and 
 sign the log book. 
 H. If there is a staff watch being conducted on 9S. the staff member cannot watch more than 
 Mo inmates on psychological observation at a time. If the Staff member is watching two 
 inmates on psychological observation, they must be directly next to one another so that the 
 officer can directly observe both of them on a continuous basis.

 that for the 5 days before that he had only slept about 30 minutes each night because of noise in SHU. He stated he is 
 anxious about going back to SHU because he stated he is going back to a place where he had gotten marks on his neck and 
 he does not know why it happened 
 He said he has an appetite and is eating. He said he is waking up every 1 1/2 hours. He stated he feels dehydrated because

 supportive. 
 7/28/19 
 The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12 hours 
 per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the "Eating/Shower Chart" may not reflect all of his 
 meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water at night. The 
 Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept. 
 Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse from Medical had seen him for this. 
 When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist 
 with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse 
 He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and 
 upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was not 
 able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got with 
 the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism spectrum. He said 
 in the movie "Rain Man," the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also really good with numbers

 He wanted it noted that he did not get all of his medications because the Doctor told him he was on Psych Observation. 
 He said he has not slept well in 21 days because of not having his cpap machine. 
 He said he read the Turning Points handouts about how to cope in SHU. He stated he knew of these strategies and had tried 
 them previously and because of the banging on the cell doors and screaming in SHU he was not able to do them. He stated 
 he may get psychological trauma from SHU. He said even with his cpap machine he may not be able to sleep in SHU 
 because of the noise in SHU.

 Good afternoon, 
 Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit 
 until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will 
 be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should 
 he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he 
 reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
 There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side 
 of our building and in front of the court house which is less then 100 yards apart from each other. 
 If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

 I've received some complaints about the Epstein legal team taking over the SHU room for entire days. 
 Given that visiting rooms are already in short supply, is there some plan to accommodate the increased demand so that

 understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
 relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding 
 officers were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the 
 incident, I am requesting that such footage also be preserved.

 Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the 
 Special Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The 
 Lieutenant called out to the inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red 
 marks on his neck. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and escorted to the 
 Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While on watch, the inmate indicated that 
 his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him and he had informed 
 his Attorney of this matter. 
 Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the 
 Physician Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
 He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical 
 encounter. Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on 
 his neck. Responded: "I don't know". 
 He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
 He does not look in any distress or pain. 
 Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
 circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this 
 erythema in the front with marks of friction. 
 No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
 moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies 
 any respiratory problem. 
 Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild). 
 Psychologist Assessment: He was evaluated on today at 9:10 a.m., and it has been 
 determined he will remain on Suicide Watch for further observation. 
 Current Status: At this time, we are reviewing his case for placement in the general 
 population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

 This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this? 
 Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. =, Chief Psychologist. He 
 will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
 DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
 disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms 
 begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain 
 in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ 
 from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or 
 engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., 
 not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
 Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the 
 inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to 
 his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
 He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation  and therefore, he will return to the Special
 Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate I . Inmate 
 pleaded  guilty. in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
 including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
 Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
 Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
 and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
 he requested Protective Custody.

 Institution 
 Supplement 
 OPI: CMC 
 NUMBER: NYM 7331.04e 
 DATE: November 13, 2014 
 SUBJECT: Pretrial Inmates 
 I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE: The primary mission of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), 
 New York, is to confine pretrial inmates for the United States Marshals (USM) Service. Pretrial 
 inmates are defined as those individuals who are legally detained, but for whom the Bureau of Prisons 
 has not yet received notification of conviction. Ordinarily, pretrial inmates will be separated, to the 
 extent possible, from convicted inmates. The purpose of this supplement is to establish the procedures 
 and operations, as well as staff responsibilities, for the operation of the institution, as it relates to pretrial 
 inmates. It is paramount this supplement is read in conjunction with the program statement as 
 information stated in national policy is not reiterated within. 
 II. DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: 
 a. Directives Rescinded: I.S. 7331.04d, Pretrial Inmates, dated June 25, 2009. 
 b. Directives Referenced: P.S. 7331.04, Pretrial Inmates, dated January 31, 2003. 
 III. PROCEDURES: MCC New York provides the care, custody, and control of inmates for the USM 
 Service, while they are in pretrial status. However, all pretrial inmates remain the responsibility of the 
 U.S. Marshal Service until they are convicted by the Court. In addition to pretrial inmates, MCC New 
 York also confines sentenced inmates and holdovers. Additionally, MCC New York houses inmates 
 on writs to the local district courts who have already been sentenced in other federal or state courts. 
 Although pretrial inmates are ideally separated from convicted inmates, it is not always possible or 
 practical to keep all pretrial inmates separate from those who have been convicted. Due to the unique 
 design, structure, and operation of MCC New York, staff may, based upon sound correctional judgment, 
 permit pretrial inmates, who do not present a risk to the security or orderly running of the institution, to 
 have regular contact with convicted inmates. Therefore, pretrial inmates at this facility may be housed 
 with convicted inmates, provided a waiver is signed. However, it is essential that pretrial inmates be 
 separated from sentenced inmates before and during the intake screening process.

 A. Procedures for Admission: The following procedures shall be followed when processing all 
 new commitments, to include the verification of commitment papers, and searches of inmates 
 and property. 
 1. Inmates entering the Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area will be identified by 
 Correctional Systems (CS)staff, formerly Inmate Systems Management (ISM) staff via an 
 interview with the remanding official and the inmate. CS staff will review the Prisoner 
 Remand (BP377) for accurate and complete information. All legal documents delivered 
 with the inmate will be verified. 
 2. All inmates will walk through a metal-weapon detector, be pat searched, and visually 
 searched; a hand-held metal detector may also be used. All inmate property will be 
 searched. 
 3. Prior to being escorted to their assigned housing units, all new commitments will receive 
 two jumpsuits, two pair of socks, two pair of underwear, one ditty bag {a toothbrush, 
 toothpaste, a comb, and shaving cream}, one pair of tennis deck shoes, and one 
 institution bedroll {two blankets, two sheets, one pillow case, one towel, and one 
 washcloth}. Female pretrial inmates receive two pair of pants and shirts, versus 
 jumpsuits, and two bras. 
 B. Intake Screening (Social Interview): Due to the lack of available information concerning 
 pretrial inmates, it is imperative a thorough intake screening is completed on all new 
 commitments. Unit team staff will conduct intake screening on all inmates committed to the 
 institution between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday. If members of 
 the Unit Team are not available, a Lieutenant will conduct the intake screening. All staff 
 members conducting intake screening must be CIM certified. 
 I. Staff conducting intake screening for new commitments will receive a SENTRY generated 
 Intake Screening form (BP-64) from R&D staff once the inmate has been loaded into 
 SENTRY. Staff must pay special attention to the CMC Clearance and Separatee Data 
 printout attached to the Intake Screening form. If SENTRY is not operational, staff 
 should utilize the manual Intake Screening form (BP-312) {Attachment A}. If possible, 
 the staff member conducting the intake screening should obtain pertinent information from 
 the Deputy U. S. Marshal, or arresting agent, committing the inmate. Staff conducting the 
 intake screening must review the U.S. Marshals Remand to Custody form to determine the 
 offense with which the inmate is being charged. The interviewer should notate if the 
 inmate is charged with a sophisticated crime, such as, Racketeering or Engaging in a 
 Continuing Criminal Enterprise, or a violent offense such as, Murder, Bank Robbery, or 
 NYM 7331.04e

 Extortion. The staff member conducting the interview will document any security 
 concerns on the Intake Screening form. Staff will also assess the inmate's physical and 
 mental condition, and document his/her conclusions on the Intake Screening form. If a 
 psychological condition is noted, screening staff must notify the Duty Psychologist 
 immediately of any noted mental concerns inmate. If on a weekend, the screening staff 
 must call the on call Duty Psychologist to interview the inmate. If available, the staff 
 member conducting the screening must review the Pre-Sentence Report and the Central 
 File. The staff member's review of this material shall be documented on the Intake 
 Screening form. Finally, the staff member conducting the interview will determine if the 
 inmate can be placed in the general population of this institution. If the inmate's 
 placement in general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of 
 the institution, the Operations Lieutenant should be notified in order for the inmate to be 
 placed in Administrative Detention. The conclusion that the inmate warrants placement in 
 Administrative Detention should be documented directly on the Intake Screening form. 
 This form must be signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening. When 
 intake screening court returns, the supplement on Intake Screening must be reviewed. A 
 separate questionnaire will be completed which addresses all questions on the SENTRY 
 generated form. All intake screening must occur in the privacy of a room with only the 
 inmate being intake screened and staff. If a notorious pretrial inmate, an inmate whose 
 presence could attract undue attention to the Bureau of Prisons, or an inmate who requires a 
 higher degree of security based on a serious volatile background or violent crime is 
 committed, the intake screener will make copies of (Inmate Alert Notice) for the 
 Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist (SCSS), CMC, SIS Office, the Lieutenant's 
 Office and the Captain. The Captain will then notify the Warden and Executive staff. 
 2. The staff member conducting the intake screening will ensure the intake screening form is 
 Filled out completely and correctly, to include all times and dates. The staff member 
 conducting the intake screening must also ensure the following forms are completed: 
 a. Pretrial Inmate Notice of Separation/Work Waiver, BP-5203.073: Staff will 
 ensure Section II of this form is completed for each new pretrial inmate. If a 
 pretrial inmate refuses to sign this form, staff will document this fact and any 
 reasons the inmate provides for refusing to sign on the form. Each new pretrial 
 inmate should also be asked to complete Section IV of this form, the work waiver 
 section. If a pretrial inmate does not wish to volunteer for a work assignment, 
 this fact should also be documented on the form. 
 If an inmate's ability to comprehend this waiver appears questionable, a referral to 
 Psychology Services will be made for determination of competency.

7331.04e 
 Pretrial Inmates 
 Page 4 
 b. Pretrial Inmate Interview, BP-5562.073: This form must be completed in 
 conjunction with the Intake Screening Form. It is essential a thorough review of 
 the inmate's status be completed upon his/her commitment. This form must be 
 completed and signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening 
 interview. 
 c. Acknowledgment of Inmates (BP407 and 408): Staff must either have each 
 inmate read or read to each inmate the policies/procedures on these forms; staff 
 must cross off the method of advisement not used. Staff must ensure these 
 forms are completed in their entirety. 
 3. The intake screener is also responsible for distributing the "Inmate Rights and 
 Responsibilities" to all new commitments. The intake screener will ensure each inmate 
 acknowledges his/her receipt of the rights and responsibilities by circling the appropriate 
 response on the Intake Screening form and signing it. If an inmate refuses to sign the 
 BP -64 to acknowledge receipt of the rights and responsibilities, staff shall document this 
 fact on the form. The completed BP-64 shall be filed in the inmate's unit management 
 file, hereinafter called the drop file. 
 4. CS staff are responsible for reviewing the U.S. Marshals receipt to review the status of 
 those inmates returning from court each day. If an inmate's pretrial status changes, ISM 
 staff will make the necessary changes in SENTRY. ISM staff is also responsible for 
 interviewing the escorting Deputy U.S. Marshal to determine if any unusual 
 circumstances occurred in court which could affect an inmate's classification at this 
 institution. 
 5. All new commitments will be issued the pamphlet entitled "Sexual Abuse/Assault 
 Prevention and Intervention." 
 C. Medical Intake Screening and Procedures: 
 1. All new commitments are examined by a physician's assistant. The physician's assistant 
 will screen all inmates in accordance with BOP medical procedures to determine if there 
 are any reasons for not placing the inmate in general population, or for restricting work 
 assignments. Specific attention shall be given to evidence of depression and potential 
 suicide, and whether the inmates are victims of recent sexual assaults during a period of 
 incarceration. A copy of the completed Intake Screening Medical form (BP-354) will 
 be placed in the inmate's file maintained in Correctional Systems. All pretrial inmates 
 will receive a complete medical screening within fourteen days of their arrival at this 
 facility. 
 Jensinve Limited gliwzal Use Only

NYM 7331.04e 
 Pretrial Inmates 
 Page 5 
 2. The Health Services Department will conduct sick call, triage, and physical exams for 
 each housing unit Monday through Friday. Medical emergencies are handled 
 immediately. 
 3. Medical staff is on duty seven days a week, in the event of a medical emergency. 
 Pretrial inmates receive the same level of basic medical care, including dental care, 
 provided to sentenced inmates. The decision to defer or deny elective medical 
 procedures shall be based on the same policies or guidelines which apply to sentenced 
 inmates. The transient nature of pretrial inmates often precludes many elective 
 procedures. Emergency medical treatment is provided in accordance with local 
 procedures, for both pretrial and sentenced inmates. The Unit Manager is responsible 
 for preparing a letter from the Warden to the Judge, through the U.S. Marshal, to notify 
 the Court of any inmate receiving any psychiatric medication and/or any other medication 
 that may alter the inmates courtroom behavior. It has been established locally that 
 the medications which fall under the realm of "psychiatric medication which may affect 
 courtroom behavior" are anti-psychotic, anti-manic, and on occasion, anti-depressants 
 medications. The Pharmacist is responsible for providing the respective Unit Manager a 
 list of inmates prescribed either anti-psychotic or anti-manic medication on a daily basis. 
 The Psychiatrist will provide the Unit Manager with a list of inmates prescribed 
 anti -depressants when he believes the medication "may affect courtroom behavior." 
 (See Attachment B). A copy of this letter will be sent to the Assistant United States 
 Attorney (AUSA), the USM, and the inmate's attorney, via the AUSA. A copy of this 
 letter will also be put in the inmate's medical file and forwarded to Psychology. These 
 same procedures apply to inmates committed for 4241(a) and 4242 psychological studies. 
 D. Housing: Pretrial inmates, who are appropriate for general population, are placed in one of the 
 seven general population housing units; six male units and one female unit. Five male housing 
 units contain secure two-man rooms; four units have a capacity of housing 96 inmates; one unit 
 has the capacity to house 94 inmates. There is one male dormitory unit which has the capacity 
 of housing 156 inmates. The female unit houses 79 inmates and housing style varies from two 
 to six woman rooms. 
 1. Unit Assignment: Due to the unique nature and structure of this facility, the MCC has the 
 capability of housing inmates who must be separated from one another. Therefore, as long 
 as an inmate does not present any unusual security or medical concerns which would require 
 his/her placement in Administrative Detention, pretrial inmates will be assigned housing 
 units in general population using their separation needs as the primary factor. The officer 
 assigned to the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Office is responsible for ensuring that 
 inmates are initially placed in the appropriate housing units. This decision will be based 
 upon accessing SENTRY and determining the inmate's separation needs; and also 
 information provided by unit staff, ISM staff, or a Lieutenant.

 self-sufficient 
 recreation, 
 MCC New York's unique design and mission require that many activities are provided on 
 the units (i.e., meal serving, pill line, recreation); the units are partially 
 requiring movement off the unit only for purposes of medical care, outdoor 
 law library, some educational classes, movement to court, and attorney meetings. 
 2. Procedures: Unit Managers are responsible for the operations within their housing units, 
 to include sanitation, clothing, property, feeding, recreation, etc. Ordinarily, Unit 
 Managers may change an inmate's quarters assignment for valid reasons. Unit staff 
 must review an inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data before moving an inmate. 
 Prior to moving an inmate classified as a disruptive group member or in the posted 
 picture file, the Unit Manager must confer with the SIS Office to ensure there exists no 
 other security reason preventing the move. To avoid sensitive information being 
 brought onto the units, the Unit Managers can confer with the CMC who has SENTRY 
 access to Security Threat Group (STG) information. Also, the Unit Manager must 
 consult with the C&A Officer before making the move to ensure the institutional count is 
 not disrupted and for further review of the inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data. 
 3. High Security Cases: Those inmates identified as requiring a greater degree of security 
 and control, but who do not require placement in the Special Housing Unit, are to be 
 placed on higher floors for increased security. Pretrial inmates whose presence in the 
 general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of the institution 
 will be housed in administrative detention in the Special Housing Unit. 
 E. Admission and Orientation (A&O): An Institutional A&O Program for pretrial inmates is 
 not required. Based on the extreme population pressures, unique needs to separate inmates by 
 fl oor and constant movement, inmates identified in this section will not be required to receive 
 institution and unit A & O, however, upon intake screening they will receive the following: 
 I. Inmate Rights and Responsibilities (located in the A & O Handbook) 
 2. Bureau Prohibited Acts and Disciplinary System (located in the A & O Handbook) 
 3. Completion of the Inmate Acknowledgment Forms (BP-S407/408) 
 A&O Handbooks are posted on all general population units in English and Spanish. All new 
 commitments housed in the Special Housing Unit receive a copy of the handbook. 
 F. Visiting: Immediate family members and one person of "meaning" will be placed on the visiting 
 list absent strong circumstances that preclude visiting. Immediate family is defined as mother, 
 father, step-parents, step-children, foster parents, grand-children, brothers, sisters, spouse and 
 children. As the situation presents itself, other non-immediate family members will be allowed 
 to visit at the approval of the Associate Warden of Programs (AWP). Further, in circumstances, 
 when an inmate requests more than ten visitors to be placed on their visiting list, the Unit 
 Sensitive Limited Vilma! Use Only 
 EFTA00035399
Manager will approve / deny any visitor exceeding the limit. Pretrial inmates may complete a 
 NYM 7331.04e 
 Pretrial Inmates 
 Page 7 
 visiting list for immediate family members as soon as they reach their assigned housing unit. 
 Pretrial inmates have the opportunity for social visits once a week. Ordinarily, each social visit 
 will last a maximum of one hour, the exception to this policy being when a visitor traveled more 
 than three hours. Visiting hours for pretrial inmates are from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 
 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Monday thru Friday. The visiting day for each unit remains the same, 
 yet the times change every other week to enable visitors to come in the afternoon and the 
 evening. 
 G. Pretrial Inmate Reviews: The Unit Manager is responsible for scheduling and documenting 
 pretrial inmate reviews for all pretrial inmates assigned to his/her unit. Each pretrial inmate 
 committed to this institution will be scheduled for a review within 21 days of admission. 
 Subsequent reviews will be conducted every 90 days. It is the responsibility of the Case 
 Manager and the Counselor to obtain the necessary information in order to hold a meaningful 
 review. The Pretrial Inmate Review Report (BP-5561.073) shall be used to document these 
 reviews. If an inmate refuses to attend a scheduled review, staff shall document the refusal, and 
 if known, the reason. The emphasis of this review will be placed on the inmate's current legal 
 proceedings, institutional adjustment, work/sanitation evaluations, and program recommendation 
 based on needs and availability. The unit team should also review the inmate's CIM status, and 
 document the review in the file (i.e. on team sheet, activity record in FOI Exempt section). 
 Unit staff should also verify the accuracy of all load data and update Sentry as needed. A 
 pretrial inmate review must have at a minimum, two Unit Staff in attendance. A docket 
 containing the names of general population inmates scheduled for review should be posted in the 
 multipurpose area of the unit at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled review. 
 The Unit Manager is also responsible for monitoring the inmate's pretrial status. Once an 
 inmate pleads guilty/is convicted, the inmate's Admission/Release status should be updated by 
 CS to reflect holdover status rather than pretrial status. These inmates are no longer considered 
 to be pretrial inmates. Once the inmate changes to A-HLD status, conducting a team is no longer 
 necessary. However, the Case Manager shall ensure that monitoring of these cases are 
 conducted informally through an informal interview documented on the Activity Log. Unit staff 
 must carefully monitor the status of the cases of those inmates who have been identified as 
 requiring a greater degree of security and control, or those inmates involved in high profile cases. 
 All pretrial inmates are normally classified as IN custody. Ordinarily, there should be no 
 reason to consider changing a pretrial inmate's custody. Changes in the custody levels of 
 pretrial inmates should only occur in rare cases. If unusual circumstances occur, the unit team 
 must refer a recommendation to increase an inmate's custody from IN to MAXIMUM to the 
 Warden for approval. The Regional Director must approve a reduction of a pretrial inmate's 
 custody from IN to a lower custody level.

 H. File Accountability: Unit Management inmate files will be maintained in the CS. All files 
 must be maintained consistent with the Program Statement and supplement pertaining to central 
 files. All files are to be counted quarterly, with a SENTRY generated roster. All files must be 
 secured at all times and no file may be left in a staff's office overnight. For specific handling 
 procedures, the supplement on central files should be referenced. 
 I. Property: Beyond those items issued by CSstaff during the admission process, section III(A)(3) 
 within, further clothing is issued by the Laundry Department to balance out the amount allowed 
 by local policy. Approved clothing for pretrial inmates is listed in the institution supplement on 
 Inmate Personal Property. Other items such as bar soap, laundry detergent, additional 
 disposable razors, paper, pencils, and envelopes are distributed on each housing unit. 
 Once arraigned and remanded to custody, all personal clothing will be shipped to an address 
 provided by the inmate. Lock boxes are not used at this facility. The committing federal 
 agents of newly arrested persons who have not been arraigned are responsible for safeguarding 
 all money and valuable items until inmates are remanded to custody, at which time the inmates 
 will forward all valuables to a person identified by themselves; monies will be credited to their 
 commissary accounts. 
 A pretrial inmate may have two sets of court clothes delivered to the institution for a jury trial or 
 for sentencing. Court clothing requests must be approved by a member of the unit team 48 
 hours prior to the delivery of the clothing. Clothing exchange is Mondays, Wednesdays, 
 Thursdays, and Fridays from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., excluding holidays, in the front lobby.

 K. Recreation: Pretrial inmates may participate in recreation activities from 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 
 p.m., except during official counts. Movies are shown on the units on weekends via the 
 Closed -Circuit Television System. The Recreation Department conducts outdoor recreation 
 seven days a week, and rotates the pretrial units' access to the roof on a daily basis. Pretrial 
 inmates have access to approximately five hours of outdoor recreation a week. 
 L. Legal Resources: The institution's Legal Department will coordinate and approve all legal 
 activities unique to a pretrial facility. Examples of these activities include arranging 
 co-defendant meetings, and providing inmates and defense attorneys with video tape players to 
 review video tapes. Unit staff will deliver audio tapes to those inmates who receive them from 
 their defense attorney or the U.S. Attorney's Office. Unit staff will also provide inmates with 
 tape players to review their tapes. Read-only computer CD access is available in the Education 
 Department if inmates' attorneys send legal material on CDs. Pretrial inmates may make 
 unmonitored calls to his/her attorney by submitting a request to a member of their unit team. 
 Staff will not limit a pretrial inmate's access to unmonitored legal calls, however, these calls are 
 granted to the extent that staff resources allow and must meet the requirements as stated in the 
 Program Statement Legal Activities, Inmate. All legal mail sent to pretrial inmates is opened in 
 their presence. Pretrial inmates may meet with their attorneys in the Attorney Conference 
 Room ordinarily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., each day, including weekends and holidays. 
 Exceptions to these times are made on a case by case basis. 
 M. Institutional Work Assignments: All pretrial inmates are responsible for housekeeping tasks 
 in their rooms and in the common living areas. Pretrial inmates may be assigned as unit 
 orderlies and receive performance pay. Each pretrial unit shall have no more than 12 orderly 
 positions. Pretrial inmates may also be assigned a work detail outside the confines of the unit, 
 provided the inmates do not have separatees in the building and are not a security risk. The unit 
 team will review each inmate's eligibility for a work assignment during pretrial inmate reviews. 
 A pretrial inmate does not earn extra good time. The unit team must ensure Section IV of the 
 Notice of Separation/Work Waiver form is executed prior to an inmate's assignment to any work 
 detail. Any pre-trial inmate, not on writ from a state facility, whose status changes to holdover 
 by virtue of the fact the inmate has been convicted or pled guilty, is eligible to work. This 
 policy is contingent upon the fact the inmate does not have any separatees in the building. 
 N. Community Activities: All pretrial inmates remain in the custody of the USM Service until 
 convicted by the Court, and therefore, are not eligible for community-based activities. In the 
 case of an emergency, unit staff shall facilitate contact with the pretrial inmate's attorney, who 
 may seek from the Court a decision concerning release from custody, or an escorted trip. 
 Additionally, unit staff will notify the U.S. Attorney's Office and the USM of the emergency. 
 Staff shall document contact with each of these agencies in the inmate's file. Release of the 
 inmate requires a Court Order, and an escorted trip must be approved by the Court. Ordinarily, 
 the USM Service will provide the escorts. This rule does not apply to emergency medical trips 
 to a local hospital.

 O. Religious Programs: Pretrial inmates in general population may participate in religious group 
 activities. Staff may enlist the aid of contract or volunteer personnel to assist in the ministering 
 of pretrial inmates. Due to the large number of separatees housed at this facility, any inmate 
 who appears on the institution's daily separation roster may not attend group services in the 
 Chapel located on Unit 5 North. Religious services for female inmates will be conducted in the 
 programs room of the female unit. Pretrial inmates who have separatees, and those housed in 
 the Special Housing Unit, must be ministered to individually on his/her unit. Inmates have the 
 opportunity to fill out a Religious Preference Summary during Intake Screening 
 P. Marriage: Pretrial inmates may request permission to marry in accordance with current BOP 
 policy. Unit staff shall contact the Court, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in the case of an alien, 
 the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to advise them of the marriage request of 
 the inmate and to request their comments. 
 Psychiatric and Psychological Counseling: Due to the transient nature of pretrial inmates, 
 individual counseling is limited to inmate needs, resolutions, and crisis intervention. Pretrial 
 inmates may be allowed the opportunity to receive counseling services by submitting a "Request 
 to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. Further, should inmates have any drug 
 dependency issues the 40-Hour Drug Program is available to pretrial male and female inmates 
 via submitting a "Request to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. 
 R. Death or Serious Illness: In the event of death or serious illness, unit staff shall prepare 
 letters, for the Warden's signature, notifying the committing Court, the United States Attorney, 
 the inmate's attorney of record, and the designated family member or next of kin, and other 
 agency with an interest (i.e. Consulate). 
 S. Discipline: Pretrial inmates are required to abide by the Bureau of Prisons rules and 
 regulations. New commitments are provided with the inmates' rights and responsibilities. 
 Regulations pertaining to discipline - prohibited acts, types of disciplinary actions which may be 
 taken, and the disciplinary system within the institution - are posted on all units, except in the 
 Special Housing Unit, and are explicit in the Admission and Orientation Booklet. 
 The respective Unit Manager is responsible for ensuring a letter, signed by the Warden, is 
 forwarded to the Court, through the U.S. Marshal, advising the Court of any findings of guilt, for 
 serious high and greatest severity incident reports, by the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO). 
 Furthermore, if the inmate violates any of the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Prisons, a 
 letter will be sent to the United States Probation Office and prosecuting Assistant United States 
 Attorney which specifies all violations. Upon an inmate's plea of guilt/conviction, the 
 discipline history of the inmate will be reviewed by the respective Unit Manager, or designee.

 EFTA00035414
Good afternoon all, 
 Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that his CPAP is 
 plugged in? 
 I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, so there is no 
 recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 days has elapsed? 
 Thank you,

 Our client Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last 
 night so he was unable to use it. 
 Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on 
 speaker phone, with officers present. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054 
 United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB 
 Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman: 
 I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
 August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
 Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
 York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
 requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
 local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
 the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
 At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An 
 autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
 medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is actively 
 investigating the incident. 
 EFTA00035425
MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
 the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
 free to call me at . Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 
 Sincerely, 
 Warden 
 MCC New York

 Dear Mr. Epstein: 
 I am writing to express my condolences to you regarding the passing of your brother, Jeffrey 
 Edward Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019. 
 On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was pronounced deceased at the New York 
 Presbyterian -Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. At this time, although 
 there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death, it appears to be the 
 result of suicide. 
 Although I realize that words alone cannot lessen your sorrow, I hope that my thoughts and 
 sincerest sympathy will be of some comfort to you. 
 Sincerely, 
 Warden 
 MCC New York

 I am working with IPPA to finalize the press release (1st draft attached). Can you please give me answers to the below: 
 (1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? 
 (2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his cell? 
 (3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-saving measures at the 
 institution? And did EMS 
 drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to the hospital? 
 (4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the hospital? 
 (5) Was the FBI notified? Is it being investigated as a suicide? 
 (6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? 
 (7) What are his specific offense titles for which he is indicted? I believe generally the news calls it sex trafficking, but we 
 should be as specifically accurate based on Sentry (or the court order if we have it).

 ... This graph is pretty explosive: A person with knowledge of the investigation said that when the decision was 
 made to remove Mr. Epstein from suicide watch, the jail informed the Justice Department that Mr. Epstein would 
 have a cellmate and that a guard "would look into his cell" every 30 minutes. 
 But that was apparently not done, the person said.

 Hi, I know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details I see out there: 
 was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed al 
 one in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's norm 
 al procedure, two officials said.

 I. When was Epstein taken off suicide watch? 
 2. How long was he on suicide watch? 
 3. What unit in the jail was he housed? 
 4. Was he by himself? 
 5. What's protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period? 
 6. Is there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of 
 restricted duty while there is an ongoing investigation? 
 7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show? 
 8. What did he use to hang himself?

 I understand officials may have given a statement yesterday on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein was on suicide watch. 
 Are you able to confirm whether or not he was or might you have a statement regarding the issue that you sent to others?

 the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the 
 concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts. 
 New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

 Hi M, 
 I hope this finds you well. My name is Christina Goldbaum and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sorry to reach out 
 out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn 
 a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and 
 I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or 
 anything that could identify you). I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying 
 around, as you know, and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. 
 Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 
 Thanks, 
 Christina

 Hi there, 
 I'm writing a piece for the site Gothamist about conditions at MCC. See allegations below, compiled from defense attorneys , 
 current prisoners and their loved ones. Please send comment ASAP if you would like to respond. 
 Regards 
 Aviva Stahl 
 — that some cells in the facility are covered in mold 
 — that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for prisoners to take 
 showers at a reasonable temperature 
 — that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They "be lucky if they were treated like dirt under somebody else's shoe, 
 but they're not even treated that well: said one lawyer 
 — that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility ("whether its people who are 
 suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need spiritual guidance or religious 
 accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get warehoused there - all of that is lacking.") 
 — that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women's floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to clean up the feces 
 themselves

 SUBJECT: Security Expectations Involving Inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054 
 During the week of July 31, 2019 in order to address management 
 concerns with inmate Epstein. I felt it was necessary to hold informal 
 training sessions with Correctional Services Supervisors and Line 
 Staff assigned to the Special Housing Unit. The informal training 
 sessions was conducted in the Lieutenants Office, inside the SHU, 
 and while conducting rounds throughout the institution. I informed 
 staff of the importance of being vigilant and being security minded 
 when dealing with inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054, and 
 other inmates within the Special Housing Unit. I explained that 
 Lieutenants were to conduct more un announced rounds in the unit, 
 providing oversite over operations and security. I pointed out 
 apparent security concerns such as observation windows being blocked 
 preventing staff from completing proper rounds, torn bed sheets, 
 clothing, covering of light fixtures, clotheslines, and the 
 accumulation of food trays in cells. I made clear of my expectations 
 of maintaining a clean and manageable unit. I explained should we 
 not continue to be proactive in the management of our inmate 
 population, there would be another occurrence of the below describe 
 incident. 
 Inmate Epstein while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
 located in New York City. In the early morning hours of July 23, 
 2019, he was found unresponsive in his cell after an apparent suicide 
 attempt. 
 In detailed conversations with the SHU Lieutenant, he was informed 
 of my expectations regarding the supervision of inmate Epstein. 
 Specifically, he was reminded on several occasions that inmate 
 Epstein was to housed with a cell mate.

 Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the

 Subject Fwd: Urgent request -- Potential leak in hospital regarding Epstein's death

 Hello, 
 > 8/10/2019 6:03 PM >>> 
 I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the 
 Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media. 
 We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before 
 ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct 
 and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation? 
 Thank you, 
 Jane

 and a disci lary report. so then told me again to do it. anyway, looks like he would need it b/c he's not a CC3 or a

 D is so ridiculous lol. that's herjob. that's why M asks whoever saw the person for the SRA or whatever to do the disciplinary 
 report. it seems like the reason he needs the report is because he received an incident report while on SW, or went to SW 
 right after. we always do them in those cases, even for people who are not high care levels or forensics. the issue is a matter 
 of the reported suicidality. all she needs to do is write what he said about the incident, and her opinion about it. if he shows 
 no signs of memory loss or cause for concem, he's competent. she's not making a judgment on whether he's guilty of the 
 infraction. she's just stating whether he's in his right mind to go through the process. isn't this part of her job as a 
 psychologist lol?? or, if she really feels like she doesn't know, then that's what she should say in the report. i feel like we just 
 enable her to skirt around her job and her clinical responsibilities, and i guess we're not going to change her at this point in 
 her career, but it's really a shame that it's gotten this far, and yes, totally ridiculous for M to even involve you. poor leadership, 
 again...

 yes, and also claiming may have done it to him but that he wasn't conscious so does not know. his scar is very 
 significant. there's obvi a ton of dishonesty and holes in the story. i spent 30 mins with him this morning and confronted him 
 a couple of times. and he still claims lack of memory and sticks to the same nonsensical story 
 >» 7/24/2019 9:21 AM > » 
 yeah, i don't know what's been going on with him, but i just think in general we really allow the guys to abuse the use of SW, 
 and i just thought it was interesting to see the response of a chief at another detention center i also agree that we don't let 
 other inmates on SW attend legal visits, so he shouldn't have either, and shouldn't have been in regular clothes even if he 
 did. again, to the other chief's point, if he can attend the legal visit that way, then he likely isn't suicidal and doesn't need to 
 be on SW. so, is the story that he has a mark on his neck and he's saying he doesn't remember how it got there? 
 >» 7/24/2019 9:18 AM >» 
 totally. i wonder if was embarrassed intros ive seeing a response like that. this is b/c of epstein. he was on SW but in 
 regular clothes on legal visit and questioned it. i told, when she asked that we have done it this way in the 
 past. in light of the huge scar on epstein's neck (granted a ton of ambiguity surrounding the incident), he did need to be on 
 SW yesterday. i guess we should have declined his legal visit if we were following this other chiefs advice 
 >» 7/24/2019 8:40 AM >» 
 lol i love this guy's response. that if this is even a question, they probably shouldn't even be on watch. we put way too many 
 people on there. i'm even seeing the difference in BRO. they just don't function that way. guys come here from MC and go 
 to SHU, and tell staff they want to go on SW, and the staff laugh at them, and the inmates tell them they were able to get on 
 watch that way at MCC. and the psych who responded to her is at Chicago, another detention center. so, I'm guessing they 
 see a lot of the same things that we do, and probably use SW less as an option.

 With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is c 
 urrently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, Marti 
 n Weinberg, has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touc 
 h with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomo 
 now, but was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state. 
 We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we woul 
 d be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you-
 is it at allpossible to address this issue so Mr. Weinberg can meet with his client this evening? I'm available anyt

 MEMORANDUM FO ED 
 FROM: 1111Aerations Lieutenant 
 SUBJECT: Possible Suicide Attempt 
 On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
 was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
 had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
 t -shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
 Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red 
 with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
 to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
 hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
 being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
 staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
 inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
 watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
 edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
 first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
 attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
 action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
 "Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
 behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
 left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
 Clarke who stated that inmate Epstein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
 Tartaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
 him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
 matter. 
 I photographed and spoke with inmate Tartaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 who stated 
 that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
 said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
 saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

 the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
 sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
 remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
 sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
 stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
 Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
 handed him a copy of the Daily News. "Nick" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
 He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that Tartaglione mentioned that he'd 
 been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
 Tartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
 Tartaglione stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
 report it. (Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
 the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
 seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
 the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
 that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
 thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
 in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
 were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
 noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
 that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
 Duty medical,  was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
 medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
 of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
 Upon the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, 
 for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the ront 
 with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

 On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
 was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
 had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
 t -shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
 Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red 
 with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
 to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
 hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
 being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
 staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
 inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
 watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
 edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
 first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
 attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
 action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
 "Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
 behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
 left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
 Clarke who stated that inmate Eostein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
 had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
 him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
 matter. 
 I photographed and spoke with inmate who stated 
 that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
 said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
 saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

 This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this? 
 Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. =, Chief Psychologist. He 
 will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where Ire will be reassessed. 
 DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
 disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms 
 begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain 
 in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ 
 from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or 
 engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., 
 not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
 Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the 
 inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to 
 his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
 He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation  and therefore, he will return to the Special
 Housin Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate I . Inmate 
 pleaded  guilty. in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
 including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
 Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
 Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
 and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
 he requested Protective Custody.

 Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with who indicated that most likely he will 
 be found competent because he is not mentally ill. We have supporting memorandums from the responding officers who 
 indicated they observed inmate Epstein with a makeshift noose around his neck. Therefore, he will be pending a UDC 
 hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate   . Inmate MI is a 
 54 -year -old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. 
 He is refusing to go to general population. 
 % The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate and 
 were determined the a ropriate candidates as cell mates. However, releases on July 26, 2019. He is 
 also the current cell mate of inmate 
 We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate. 
 If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

 There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic 
 information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we 
 could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the

 that housing him with another sex offender in SHU would be a goo i ea. told him I would speak with the executive staff 
 about his suggestion. Also, thought it wise that we keep him down here for a bit (as is the plan already). 
 I am heading to the hospital in about a half an hour or so. If you need me for anything, feel free to call my cell phone■ 
 Thank you.

 Hi DAD
 There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic 
 information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we 
 could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the 
 Warden and Assistant Warden.

Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there 
 again. I wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs 
 rather than keeping him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that 
 way when he is interviewed today. I will be in touch this morning.

 Dear Mr. Epstein, 
 You called me circa August 2017 and you and I had a Skype call with my Ph.D. 
 student, Ms. Zeinab Bandpey, in December 2017.

 I can help you. 
 C 
 I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically 
 black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world 
 you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can 
 1 
 EFTA00035613
be for "The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which will 
 show the world your support for women. 
 Alternatively, Mark Zuckerberg gave $3 million "Breakthrough Awards" to two math 
 professors. You can give me a similar award. Lord Robert May of Oxford, 
 former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, "I thought your analysis of 
 the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful." In 2018, I solved a problem of Pdlya 
 Prize-winner Anders Bjbmer which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a "challenging question" 
 in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices. 
 I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in 
 the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now. 
 If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject 
 your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for 
 a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000! 
 https://www.givecampus.comischoolsAincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowship 
 I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting 
 money from you would be "a tough one for a UK institution," but if you funded me as an 
 individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might 
 be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and 
 you'd have an advocate at one of the world's most prestigious universities publically defending 
 you. I could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

 Good afternoon all, 
 Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that his CPAP is 
 plugged in? 
 I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, so there is no 
 recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 days has elapsed? 
 Thank you,

 Good afternoon 
 Our client Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last 
 night, so he was unable to use it. 
 Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on 
 speaker phone, with officers present. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this 
 inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on 
 PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
 Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by 
 BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
 "This writer consulted with Dr. S Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors 
 for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding 
 today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns 
 from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he 
 returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate 
 Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

 Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. =, Chief Psychologist. He 
 will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
 DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
 disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms 
 begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain 
 in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ 
 from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or 
 engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., 
 not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
 Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the 
 inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to 
 his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
 He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation  and therefore, he will return to the Special 
 Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate I . Inmate 
 pleaded  guilty. in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
 including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
 Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
 Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
 and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
 he requested Protective Custody.

 TO 
 FR 
 SUB 
 On July 23, 2019 at approximately 1:27, I, responded to a body alarm on the 
 Special Housing Unit. While the 9-South officer was conducted rounds inmate Epstein, Jeffrey 
 #76318-054 was found in his cell with a noose around his neck and appeared to be unresponsive. 
 I assisted with taking inmate Epstein #76318-054 from his cell and putting him on a stretcher. 
 The inmate was taken to the second floor and placed on suicide watch, where he was monitored by 
 staff. Moments afterwards, inmate Epstein became responsive. While observing inmate Epstein 
 he sat up on the bed and began telling me that he think his Bunkie, Tartaglione, Nicholas 
 #78514-054 tried to kill him. Inmate Epstein also stated that his Bunkie also tried to extort 
 money from him and stated that if he didn't pay him that he would beat him up. He stated that 
 this has been going on for a week. I asked inmate Epstein if he told staff about this and he told 
 me no, that he'd only told his lawyer. He went on to say that his Bunkie told him that if he beat 
 him up, because of his charges, the officers would not report it and because of this he was not 
 comfortable telling the officers about the prolong threats and alleged attempts to extort him. I 
 immediately reported this to the lieutenant.

 Please see the message from below that of the AUSA. It looks accurate, but she inadvertently wrote "EPSTEIN'S cell

 Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with who indicated that most likely he will 
 be found competent because he is not mentally ill. We have supporting memorandums from the responding officers who 
 indicated they observed inmate Epstein with a makeshift noose around his neck. Therefore, he will be pending a UDC 
 hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate  Inmate MI is a

 Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there 
 again. I wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs 
 rather than keeping him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that 
 way when he is interviewed today. I will be in touch this morning.

 I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow befor 
 e his Legal visit to see him again. 
 He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathr 
 oom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
 He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there 
 because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

 At approximately 1:27AM, I responded to a radio transmission asking for staff assistance

 location (M Tier) in which the disturbance stemmed from. I was told by Officer that 
 Epstein, Jeffrey I/M# 76318-054 has attempted to hang himself. Upon arrival to cell 
 in which he was housed, I noticed J. E stein I/M# 76318-054 on the floor and Officer 
 placing restraints on him. Officer Lt. and I entered said cell attempting to 
 assist in said process. 
 Now that I am inside of the cell I notice that J. Epstein I/M# 76318-054 was snoring on the 
 floor of his cell, he appeared to be asleep. We made several verbal commands for him to wake up 
 and attempted to get him to his feet but they were all unsuccessful. After said attempts Lt. 
 asked for a stretcher to be retrieve to safely remove him out of his cell. Once the 
 stretcher arrived, Officer Officer and I lifted J. Epstein I/M# 76318-054 olL 
 the floor and placed him on t e stretcher. Once we secured him safely on the stretcher, Officer 
 and I lifted J. Epstein UM# 76318-054 who is now on the stretcher safely out of 9 South

 (1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? No. 
 (2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his cell? Yes. 
 (3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-saving measures at the 
 institution? And did EMS drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to the hospital? EMS arrived at the institution 
 and BOP staff along with EMS transported the inmate to the local hospital. 
 (4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the hospital? No. 
 Epstein was pronounced dead at the local hospital at approximately 7:36 am.

 (6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? July 6, 2019.

 Subject: Inmate Epstein, J. 76318054 - Notify Psychology ASAP when he returns from court 
 Date: Mon, 08 Jul 2019 14:50:20 +0000 
 Importance: Normal 
 Attachments: TEXT.htm 
 I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this 
 inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on 
 PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
 Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by 
 BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
 "This writer consulted with Dr. S Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors 
 for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding 
 today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns 
 from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he 
 returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate 
 Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment'

 I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal vi 
 sit to see him again. 
 He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks i 
 n Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
 He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of 
 the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

 Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
 He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse saw him. 
 He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has nu 
 mbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
 He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toil 
 et before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell. 
 Thanks,

 MEMORANDUM FOR 
 ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
 FROM: Acting Section Chief 
 External Audits, Planning, and Analysis Section 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) Final Report 
 dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau 
 of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
 of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on April 2, 2025. The Bureau has 
 completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis and 
 its recommendations.

 EFTA00034219
BOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the BOP's previous status update, Program 
 Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, will be modified to address 
 the recommendation. These revisions must follow the normal policy development and Union 
 negotiation process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow the normal BOP 
 development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The BOP will provide 
 further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
 risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
 until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
 plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
 individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
 negotiation process. Accordingly, the O16 will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
 finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
 BOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the BOP's previous status update, Program 
 Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, will be modified to address 
 the recommendation. These revisions must follow the normal policy development and Union 
 negotiation process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow the normal BOP 
 development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The BOP will provide 
 further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
 and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
 process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5324.08 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
 negotiation process. Accordingly, the O16 will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
 finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
 BOP Response: The BOP is in the process of revising Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide 
 Prevention Program, to address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must 
 follow the normal policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to 
 EFTA00035777
Program Statements must follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process, 
 they are subject to change. The BOP will provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
 methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
 negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy revisions referenced in its update; and (2) provides the 
 finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
 BOP Response: The BOP is in the process of revising Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional 
 Services Procedures Manual, to address the recommendation, and these revisions must follow 
 the normal policy development process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow 
 the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The 
 BOP will provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
 conducting a round. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 also previously indicated that the policy revisions will require Lieutenants to conduct training 
 sessions that allow for individual assessment and training regarding conducting rounds to be 
 tailored to the needs of each individual facility. The BOP has indicated that these revisions must 
 follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will 
 consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy revisions 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
 BOP Response: The BOP is in the process of revising Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional 
 Services Procedures Manual, to address the recommendation, and these revisions must follow 
 the normal policy development process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow 
 the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The 
 BOP will provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
 address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has reported 
 that it has implemented the staffing tool for all professions, but that it is still working on several 
 EFTA00035778
other initiatives regarding staffing, including analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of 
 both recruitment and retention incentives, analyzing whether the new incentives and nation-wide 
 direct hire authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage, 
 and establishing a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions. In this update, the BOP 
 reported that it has analyzed its use of staffing incentives and found notable improvement in 
 overall employee retention rates as a result of such incentives. However, the BOP further 
 reported that due to budgetary constraints, the BOP is reducing or eliminating our use of 
 incentives effective March 23, 2025. 
 The OIG will continue to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 In addition, per the OIG's communications with the BOP, we believe that certain information 
 that the BOP has provided or will provide to Congress and the Government Accountability 
 Office (GAO) will facilitate the resolution and closure of this recommendation. Accordingly, we 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG any 
 additional contractor and BOP work product that has been submitted to the GAO in response to 
 the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations,; (2) provides the OIG an update on its use and 
 analysis of staffing incentives and any efforts to seek additional funding to continue to pursue 
 staffing incentives; (3) provides the OIG any additional reports submitted to Congressional 
 appropriation committees related to staffing; and (4) provides the OIG with an update on the 
 salary proposal submitted to OPM, including whether OPM has approved or disapproved of the 
 pay table proposals. 
 BOP Response: OIG indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
 the Bureau: 
 1. Provides the OIG any additional contractor and BOP work product that has been 
 submitted to the GAO in response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations. 
 The BOP has not provided any additional work products to GAO. 
 2. Provides the OIG an update on its use and analysis of staffing incentives and any 
 efforts to seek additional funding to continue to pursue staffing incentives. 
 As stated in the previous response, the analysis has been completed as the Bureau has begun to 
 achieve its four identified goals with the increase in retention incentive spending. While it was 
 noted in the previous response an analysis was still pending for FY 2024 new hires, an analysis 
 was conducted from FY2021 to FY2023, and it noted an increase of 4.6% in retention rate from 
 83.5% to 88.1%. However, it should be noted that in an effort to remain within the Agency's 
 fiscal parameters, the BOP implemented significant reductions and eliminations of retention 
 incentives agencywide in March 2025. These changes were necessary to ensure financial 
 solvency and operational continuity. The BOP plans to continue to seek funding to reinstate 
 incentives, and/or seek funding for special salary rates to retain staff in the BOP. 
 EFTA00035779
3. Provides the OIG any additional reports submitted to Congressional appropriation 
 committees related to staffing. 
 No additional reports have been submitted to Congressional appropriation committees related to 
 staffing. 
 4. Provides the OIG with an update on the salary proposal submitted to OPM, 
 including whether OPM has approved or disapproved of the pay table proposals. 
 OPM has not provided any updates, to include approval or disapproval, of the pay table 
 proposals. Currently funding is not available to support BOP's request. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
 system functionality checks. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG reviewed the 
 BOP's new Security Camera Monthly Report and appreciates the progress the BOP has made in 
 creating this form and instituting the new monthly reporting process. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statements 5500.14 and 4200.12 to address the 
 recommendation. The BOP has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP 
 development and Union negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to 
 close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates referenced in its update; 
 and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
 BOP Response: Program Statements 5500.15, Correctional Services Manual, and 4200.12, 
 Facilities Operations Manual, are being modified to include protocols and ensure accountability 
 regarding various aspects of the Bureau's camera systems, including but not limited to 
 functionality, documentation, and repair. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow 
 the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The Bureau 
 will provide further updates as they become available.

 MEMORANDUM FOR 
 ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
 FROM: 
 External Auditing Branch 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
 Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
 Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
 of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on August 28, 2024. The FBOP 
 has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis 
 and its recommendations. 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
 the particular individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, the 
 BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the field on a 
 process to ensure psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of 
 a cellmate, for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. The BOP 
 further reported that this process will include exemptions based on individual or security 
 considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that this guidance had been drafted and 
 was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the 
 OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance 
 referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
 EFTA00035781
FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
 development. FBOP has determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program 
 Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a 
 guidance memorandum. FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process 
 already established for single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but 
 apply it to general population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program 
 Review policy will prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if 
 single -cell placement in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language 
 pertaining to the process in the policy for SHU. 
 The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will explain that, 
 if it appears necessary to single cell an individual in a general population unit during regular 
 working hours, the Unit Manager will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) 
 for their recommendations. If a single cell is required after hours or on weekends, the Operations 
 Lieutenant will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) telephonically for their 
 recommendations. Monitoring single-ceiling in the general population will be recorded on 
 "BP -A1121 CO Single Cell Review Form-GP" (see attachment). This form will be signed by the 
 Warden as soon as feasible following the placement of an individual in a single cell. These forms 
 will be reviewed and discussed during the weekly multidisciplinary team meetings and the 
 recommendations (to continue or discontinue) will be recorded by the Unit Manager in 
 TRUSCOPE, as a "daily log entry." 
 Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
 become available. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
 risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
 until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
 plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
 individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
 the BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the 
 field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
 individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
 psychologist. The BOP further reported that this memo will include a procedure for exemptions 
 based on individual or security considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that 
 this guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance 
 is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (I) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized 
 guidance to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
 development. Further, as stated in the response to Recommendation I, above, FBOP has 
 EFTA00035782
determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program Statement 5321.09, Unit 
 Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a guidance memorandum. 
 FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process already established for 
 single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but apply it to general 
 population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will 
 prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if single-cell placement 
 in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language pertaining to the process in the 
 policy for SHU. 
 Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
 become available. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
 and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
 process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
 the BOP reported that it was evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting approval for 
 social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. In a 
 February 2024 update, the BOP reported that while it currently does not have guidance on these 
 issues, new guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the 
 guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
 recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) 
 provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in its previous status update, FBOP was developing guidance 
 with regard to its process for obtaining and documenting approval for social and/or legal visits 
 while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. However, upon further 
 consideration, FBOP has determined that this guidance should not be in the form of a guidance 
 memorandum, but should instead be included in Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention 
 Policy. Therefore, FBOP is in the process of altering that policy accordingly. Because revisions 
 to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and Union negotiation 
 process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they become available. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
 methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
 EFTA00035783
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
 OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
 for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
 the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
 provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant N1 lien 
 conducting a round. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP reported that 
 it is updating its policy to address the recommendation. In its February 2024 update, the BOP 
 also indicated that it would be conducting training for Lieutenants on conducting rounds. The 
 OIG therefore previously asked the BOP to provide "a description of the training referenced in 
 its update, sample training materials for OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in 
 effect." The BOP has indicated that, to allow for variation based on the specific needs of each 
 institution, there will not be a specific BOP-wide curriculum for the training; however, training 
 will be conducted and documented on the Daily Lieutenant Logs and reviewed by the Captain 
 for specific local training needs. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
 recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program statement update referenced in its 
 update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
 for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
 the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
 provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
 address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will continue 
 to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. Accordingly, we will 
 consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG an update on 
 the contractor's or GOP's analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, whether submitted 
 yet to GAO or not; (2) implements the staffing tool for all BOP professions; (3) provides an 
 analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire authority mentioned in its 
 update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage; (4) provides an update on its efforts 
 to establish a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions; and (5) describes any 
 additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, 
 that are being considered by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage and provides an 
 EFTA00035784
update to the OIG on the Department's consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such 
 proposal. 
 FBOP Response: OIG indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
 FBOP: 
 1. Provides an update on the contractor's or FBOP's analysis of staffing incentives 
 since March 2023; whether submitted yet to GAO or not. 
 The FBOP is currently analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of both recruitment and 
 retention incentives. This analysis is ongoing. Therefore, FBOP will provide an update to OIG 
 when completed. 
 2. Implements the staffing tool for all FBOP professions. 
 The Automated Staffing Tool (AST) went live officially on October I, 2024, and has been 
 implemented for all FBOP professions. This workforce planning tool will allow FBOP 
 leadership to identify true institution position needs to safely and effectively operate all of the 
 FBOP's 122 institutions. The AST recommends position numbers based on data driven insights 
 from internal and external subject matter experts, institution-specific criteria, and evolving 
 mission requirements. 
 3. Provides an analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire 
 authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing 
 shortage. 
 The FBOP continues to collect data in an effort to complete its analysis in 2025. However, 
 preliminary analysis has shown retention incentives to be an effective factor when comparing 
 data from the recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, the lowest number of total separations occurred 
 with 2,572 separations. In FY 2023, the FBOP had 2,900 separations. FY 2022 had the highest 
 number of separations in the FBOP in recent years with 3,665. 
 Recruitment measures have also made an impact in the most recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, 
 FBOP saw the largest influx of staff since FY 2021, with 3,596 new hires. Comparatively, 
 FY 2023 saw 2,622 new hires and 1,846 in FY 2022. After receiving nationwide DHA approval 
 in May 2024, and continuing through September 2024, the FBOP has hired over 450 correctional 
 officers with Direct Hiring Authority, totaling 642 for FY 2024. This is significantly greater than 
 our total of 196 new hires for FY 2023 and 83 new hires for FY 2022 without nationwide DHA. 
 4. Provides an update on its efforts to establish a nationwide special salary rate for 
 institution positions. 
 The FBOP is continuing to actively collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a special salary rate aimed at addressing 
 recruitment and retention challenges within our institutions by offering more competitive 
 salaries. Currently, the FBOP is focusing Special Salary Rate efforts on the Correctional Officer 
 EFTA00035785
and nurse positions and submitted its request to DOJ at the end of September 2024. DOJ 
 informed FBOP that both requests are under OPM review. 
 5. Describes any additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address 
 pay rates in certain localities, that are being considered by the BOP to fully address 
 the staffing shortage and provides an update to the OIG on the Department's 
 consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such proposal. 
 As of November 2024, FBOP has no further input regarding proposals being considered to 
 address the staffing shortage. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
 system functionality checks. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, and Program Statement 4200.12, Facilities Operations 
 Manual, are being modified to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various 
 aspects of FBOP's camera systems, including but not limited to functionality, documentation, 
 and repair. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates as they 
 become available. 
 However, to ensure immediate action, a joint memorandum from FBOP's Administration 
 Division and Correctional Programs Division was sent to all CEOs addressing necessary camera 
 protocols. See attachments "Camera Report Implementation signed" and "Security Camera 
 Report Template." The joint memorandum implemented a monthly reporting process in all 
 facilities and attached a template to use for monthly reporting. The monthly reporting requires 
 electronic technicians at each facility to list the number of installed cameras, adjustments to the 
 camera count as needed, information regarding camera recording capability and camera 
 operational state, and information regarding any repairs made to the cameras during the month of 
 reporting. The Captain and Facility Manager must review each monthly report from the facility 
 and ensure accuracy. The monthly Security Camera Report will then be included in the Facilities 
 Management Monthly Report to Regional offices and submitted from the Warden to the 
 Regional Director. The new monthly Security Camera Report is now in use and became effective 
 June 1, 2024.

Fox News Tucker Carlson Segment 
 January 25, 2023 
 Summary 
 Tucker Carlson: So you would think as the Attorney General (referring to Bill Barr) his first concern would 
 be finding out what actually happened but instead his first concern was worried that the public might jump 
 to unapproved conclusions about what happened. And in some ways, Bill Barr was right to worry. Many 
 Americans did not believe that Jeffrey Epstein had killed himself given the strange circumstances of his 
 death —stranger than most people understood at the time. It was going to take a sustained public relations 
 campaign to convince Americans that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but Bill Barr was willing to make the 
 effort. 2 days later, he flew to New Orleans, gave a speech, and said this: 
 / was appalled and indeed the whole Department was, and frankly, angry, to learn of the MCCs 
 failure to adequately secure tin's. prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this 
 facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation. The FBI and the Office of 
 Inspector General are doing just that. We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be 
 accountability. 
 Tucker Carlson: 3.5 years after Jeffrey Epstein died, no one has gotten to the bottom of what happened 
 that day and there has been no accountability for it. The only people ever punished for the grotesque 
 malfeasance surrounding Epstein's death were two low-level guards who fell asleep on duty that night. 
 Both pleaded guilty to falsifying government records. But last year, with no real explanation, an Obama-
 appointed judge dropped all charges against both of them. One of the guards may still work for the federal 
 government. As for getting to the bottom of what happened—despite many promises from many various 
 officials —not to the FBI nor the Justice Departments Office of Inspector General has ever issued a report 
 explaining how Jeffrey Epstein died...not a word. So, once again, 3.5 years after one of the most widely 
 covered deaths of our time, there's still no answers and there's still no accountability. Why is that? 
 Tucker Carlson quotes from Bill Barr's memoir regarding the medical examiner. Tucker Carlson questions 
 why reporters never questioned Bill Barr's assessment of Epstein's death. Tucker Carlson resumes 
 discussing the initial medical examiners assessment, and then discusses NYC's chief medical examiner 
 Barbara Sampson's declaration of Epstein's death of suicide. Tucker Carlson then begins discussing 
 Epstein's cell and surrounding inmates, saying BOP wouldn't provide Carlson with the inmate's names on 
 Epstein's tier. 
 Tucker Carlson: This week, we've called virtually every person involved in the story surrounding Epstein's 
 death. With very few exceptions, none of them would speak to us. Some hung up immediately. Others 
 declined all comment. One of them, the DOJ case officer supposedly assigned to investigate Epstein's 
 death, refused even to acknowledge that he worked for the federal government. "I'm not going to confirm 
 or deny that" said Mr. Lyeson Daniel when we reached him on his cell phone. 'Why is that?' we asked him. 
 "I'm not going to confirm or deny that" he repeated. 
 Tucker Carlson then begins discussing Jeffrey Epstein's denial of an alleged suicide attempt on July 23, 
 EFTA00035791
2019. Carlson also asks wants to know if the celVs on Epstein's tier were locked the entire night he was 
 killed and says a source claims they weren't. He also wants to know who moved Epstein's body, re-dressed 
 Epstein's corpse, and intubated it. 
 Tucker Carlson: We dutifully called the Department of Justice to ask them to explain some of this, they 
 refused on the grounds that there is quote "an active investigation in progress." But that is a lie. There is 
 no investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death. We're moving on 4 years now, there has never been an 
 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death...the death of an American citizen. We can only speculate as to 
 why that is, but all the explanations are bad and ominous. Maybe someone in the new Republican 
 Congress should look into all of this. Not because Jeffrey Epstein was an American hero, but because for 
 once, it'd be nice to see the federal government forced to tell the truth about something.

 MEMORANDUM FOR 
 ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
 FROM: 
 External Auditing Branch 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
 Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
 Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
 of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on November 13, 2023. The 
 FBOP has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the 
 analysis and its recommendations. 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
 particular individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG will 
 consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in 
 its update, or puts in place other policies or procedures to address assignment of a cellmate following 
 suicide watch or psychological observation; and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for 
 review. 
 FBOP's Response: The FBOP Reentry Services Division (RSD) and Correctional Programs 
 Division (CPD) have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is currently under review. 
 FBOP plans to issue the guidance at the conclusion of the review process. 
 EFTA00035793
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
 suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
 recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
 re -assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
 considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is not responsive to the recommendation. This update 
 essentially repeats the update for Recommendation I and does not address the need for 
 continuity of a cellmate assignment, including a contingency plan for cellmate reassignment, 
 with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations. The 
 OIG's Epstein report found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a new 
 cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of the Metropolitan Correction Center in 
 New York, and that a contingency plan, such as a list of alternate cellmates, would have 
 increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed alone at the time of his death. 
 The OIG will need a further update from the BOP on this recommendation. 
 FBOP's Response: RSD and CPD have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is 
 currently under review. FBOP plans to issue the guidance at the conclusion of the review 
 process. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
 provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
 mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
 observation. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will await 
 further information from the BOP following its evaluation. 
 FBOP's Response: An evaluation of FBOP policies shows there is no current guidance on this 
 issue. Therefore, FBOP has drafted guidance. This guidance is currently under review. FBOP 
 plans to issue the guidance at the conclusion of the review process. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
 through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the 010 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the program 
 statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized update to the OIG for 
 review. 
 FBOP's Response: The Correctional Services Procedures Manual is in the process of being 
 updated to improve FBOP methods for accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. FBOP 
 will keep OIG apprised of its progress. 
 EFTA00035794
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
 conducting a round. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the program 
 statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized update to the OIG for 
 review. 
 FBOP's Response: The Correctional Services Procedures Manual is in the process of being 
 updated to clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round. FBOP will keep 
 OIG apprised of its progress. 
 Additionally, training sessions will be conducted, at a minimum with all Correctional Services 
 staff, per the schedule issued annually by Correctional Programs Division. This training may be 
 conducted in-person during Lieutenant Rounds or via virtual/telephonic platform, as annotated 
 within the schedule. 
 Documentation of all trainings will be annotated in the Lieutenant's Log specifying the training 
 topic and the method in which it was completed (i.e., mock exercise, in-person walking tour, or 
 via virtual/ telephonic). 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
 staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation, but does not provide 
 adequate grounds for closure of the recommendation. In the interest of economizing resources 
 for both the BOP and the OIG, the OIG will consolidate analysis of this recommendation with 
 that of Recommendation 5 from the OIG's Limited-Scope Review of the Federal Bureau of 
 Prisons' Strategies to Identify, Communicate, and Remedy Operational Issues, Report 
 Number 23-065 (Limited-Scope Review). Please report any additional updates on the BOP's 
 response to this recommendation to the OIG's Evaluation and Inspections Division in connection 
 with the Limited-Scope Review. The OIG will close this recommendation when it closes 
 Recommendation 5 from the Limited-Scope Review. 
 FBOP's Response: FBOP appreciates OIG's efforts to consolidate recommendations where 
 feasible during the audit resolution and follow up process but does not concur with consolidating 
 the analysis of this recommendation with that of Recommendation 5 from the OIG's Limited-
 Scope Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Strategies to Identify, Communicate, and 
 Remedy Operational Issues, Report Number 23-065 (Limited-Scope Review). Although the two 
 have similarities, the recommendations and action steps to address each differ. The automated 
 staffing tool (AST), which continues to be tested and evaluated, and has an estimated completion 
 of the end of FY2024. While the development and implementation of the AST will be responsive 
 to the Limited-Scope Review, it will not fully demonstrate FBOP's current efforts to address 
 staffing shortages. Therefore, FBOP requests the analyses and responses remain separate. 
 EFTA00035795
The FBOP continues to offer several incentives to attract and retain staff. As indicated in its 
 September 2023 status update, the Director has authorized a bureau-wide recruitment incentive 
 of $10,000 or 25% on initial salary (whichever is greater), for newly hired Correctional Officers 
 and this incentive has been extended through FY2024. Also noted was the current 10% retention 
 incentive for all Lieutenants and the bureau-wide group retention incentive ranging from 5-8% 
 that is available to employees eligible to retire through December 2022. Additionally, the FBOP 
 currently offers retention incentives ranging from 10-25% percent for Correctional Officers and 
 other institution positions working at hard to fill locations as well as relocation incentives for 
 specifically identified locations ranging from 10-25%. To further expand recruitment and 
 staffing efforts, a waiver was granted to increase the maximum entry age for Correctional 
 Officers who enter on duty prior to September 30, 2024. 
 The FBOP is taking a multistep approach to filing all funded vacancies across the FBOP to 
 include increased marketing and branding, utilization of recruitment incentives, utilization of pay 
 fl exibilities, onboarding, and utilization of retention incentives. The FBOP is employing a 
 marketing and branding campaign to attract new and highly qualified applicants to apply to 
 current vacancies. Additionally, FBOP is utilizing various recruitment incentives and pay 
 fl exibilities to offer comparable and/or competitive salaries. This includes special salary rates, 
 above minimum rate, and student loan repayment. Finally, FBOP increased its utilization of 
 retention incentives, where warranted, to retain highly qualified and knowledgeable employees. 
 Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
 as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is not responsive to the recommendation. The update says that 
 the BOP will discuss existing policies with staff, but does not indicate that the BOP has or will 
 evaluate its cell search procedures and make any necessary changes to improve those procedures 
 through policy, training, or other measures. 
 FBOP's Response: CPD is in the process of formulating direction to ensure CPD can evaluate 
 the logging of cell searches within TRUSCOPE. Additionally, the Correctional Services Manual 
 update, per our response in Recommendation 5 states training sessions will be conducted, at a 
 minimum with all Correctional Services staff, per the schedule issued annually by Correctional 
 Programs Division. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
 functionality checks. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the policy update 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized update to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP's Response: In response to OIG's most recent analysis, the FBOP can confirm it is 
 updating the Correctional Services Manual and the Facilities Operations Manual to include

 I can help you. 
 I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically 
 black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world 
 you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation 
 can be for "The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which 
 will show the world your support for women. 
 Alternatively, Mark Zuckerberg gave $3 million "Breakthrough Awards" to two math 
 professors. You can give me a similar award. Lord Robert May of Oxford, former 
 President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, "I thought your analysis of the 
 bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful." In 2018,1 solved a problem of Polya 
 Prize-winner Anders BjOrner which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a "challenging 
 question" in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices. 
 I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you 
 in the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now. 
 If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will 
 reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 
 million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000! 
 https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollegehnathematics-fellowship 
 I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that 
 accepting money from you would be "a tough one for a UK institution," but if you funded me 
 as an individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they 
 might be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer

 b. "3. Each count will be conducted with at least two officers. 
 There will be no inmate movement during an official count. The 
 count process will not be interrupted under any circumstances, 
 other than by an emergency. Exceptions to the no inmate 
 movement must be when inmates are in the wrong place for a 
 count and have to be moved by direct staff escort to their 
 proper place of count. Staff must not be distracted during the 
 count. One staff member will count while the second staff 
 member stands in a position to observe inmate movement. 
 When the first staff member completes the count, the staff 
 member will change positions. The second staff member will 
 conduct the count while the other staff member observes the 
 inmates. If the staff members count totals do not match, a 
 recount will be conducted in the same manner." 
 c. "4. Staff will not conduct a count based upon movements, 
 sounds, or configurations from a covered bed. 
 d. Staff will ensure they are positively observing human flesh 
 before counting any inmate."

 conducted the count. Altered/illegible count slips are not 
 acceptable." 
 3. 310. Special Accountability 
 a. "A staff member must observe all inmates confined in 
 continuous locked down status, such as administrative 
 detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 
 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00 a.m. - 12:30 a.m.) 
 followed by another round in the second 30 minute period of 
 the same hour (example, 12:30 a.m. — 1:00 a.m.), thus ensuring 
 an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are 
 to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 
 minutes apart. All observations must be documented. 
 b. Closer observation may be required for an inmate who is 
 mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre behavior.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 June 22, 2023 
 DOJ OIG Releases Report on Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Custody, 
 Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New 
 York 
 Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today the release of a report 
 regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison's custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein while detained at 
 the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York). The DOJ Office of the 
 Inspector General (OIG) initiated this investigation and review upon receipt of information from the BOP 
 that inmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 
 City of New York, determined that Epstein had died by suicide. The DOJ OIG conducted this investigation 
 jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG's investigative focus being the conduct of 
 BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein's death and determined 
 there was no criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died. 
 The OIG's investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, 
 including multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which led to Epstein being 
 unmonitored and alone in his cell, which contained an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately 
 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his locked cell the following day. While the OIG 
 determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence 
 contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein 
 died. 
 The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP's 
 ability to operate its institutions safely and securely. Many of those same operational challenges, including 
 staffing shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide, functional security camera systems, and 
 management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by 
 the OIG during this investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the 
 BOP's most notorious inmates. 
 The OIG's findings included the following: 
 EFTA00035824
• MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Following a July 
 23, 2019 incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York 
 Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate 
 cellmate. On August 9, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York 
 staff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate as was required, but did not take steps to ensure 
 that Epstein was assigned a new cellmate. 
 • MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein 
 and Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all 
 inmates at least twice an hour and that lieutenants conduct at least one round in the SHU each shift. 
 BOP policy also requires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour period. Among other things, 
 inmate counts and rounds enable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they are secure in their 
 cells and in good health. Further, to eliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU staff to 
 search SHU common areas and at least five cells daily, and to search the entire SHU every week. 
 A search of Epstein's cell following his death revealed Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and 
 clothing in his cell, and that some had been ripped to create nooses. Only one SHU cell search was 
 documented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein's cell. BOP records did not indicate when 
 Epstein's cell was last searched. The OIG also found that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute 
 rounds after about 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were 
 conducted after 4:00 p.m. on August 9. 
 • MCC New York Falsified BOP Records Relating to Inmate Counts and Rounds. MCC New York 
 falsified count slips and round sheets to show that they had been performed when they were not, 
 leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his death. 
 • The DOJ OIG Did Not Uncover Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was 
 No Criminality Associated with Epstein's Death. The OIG reviewed the available recorded video 
 footage and found that, between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and about 6:30 a.m. on 
 August 10, no one was seen entering Epstein's cell tier from the SHU common area. Further, the 
 SHU staff and three interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to Epstein's cell door on the night 
 of his death stated that no one entered or exited Epstein's cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein 
 to his cell on August 9. None of the MCC New York staff members we interviewed were aware of 
 any information suggesting Epstein's cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, 
 none of the inmates we interviewed had any credible information suggesting Epstein's cause of 
 death was something other than suicide. 
 We noted as well that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological 
 observation due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from the excess prison 
 sheets -linens  were found in his cell on the morning of August 10; that no weapons were recovered 
 from his cell after his death; and that he signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days 
 2 
 EFTA00035825
before he died. We found that the staffs failure to assign Epstein a cellmate on August 9, to conduct 
 rounds and counts that evening, and to allow him to have excess linens in his cell, left Epstein 
 unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours, which provided him an opportunity to commit 
 suicide. 
 The DOJ OIG made nine recommendations  to improve the Bars management of its correctional 
 institutions. The BOP agreed with all nine recommendations.

Executive Summary 
 This analysis, conducted in response to GAO Priority Recommendation 2*, examines the correlation between inmate participation in drug 
 treatment programs and staffing levels from FY2021 to FY2024. This analysis examines (1) the correlation between inmate participation in 
 drug treatment programs and the total number of BOP employees, and (2) the correlation between inmate participation in drug 
 treatment programs and the number of filled FSA positions. Findings reflect correlation only and do not imply causation.

 Insights 
 Total Number of BOP Employees 
 • No correlation between the total number of BOP employees and the number of inmates 
 participating in all drug treatment programs. 
 • No correlation between the total number of BOP employees and the number of inmates 
 participating in individual drug treatment programs.** 
 Number of Filled FSA Positions 
 • No correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of inmates 
 participating in the Drug Education Program, RDAP, or Community Treatment programs. 
 • Moderate correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the total number 
 of inmates participating in all drug treatment programs. 
 • Moderate correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of 
 inmates participating in NRDAP. 
 • Strong correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of 
 inmates participating in the MAT Program. 
 There is no trend indicating 
 that changes in the number 
 of BOP employees affect 
 inmate participation in 
 drug treatment programs. 
 This indicates that increases 
 in filled FSA positions are 
 generally associated with 
 higher inmate participation 
 in certain drug treatment 
 programs, though other 
 factors may also play a role.

 I. INTRODUCTION 
 For this module of Back 2 Basics, we will be reviewing policy and procedures for effectively 
 performing duties when managing a housing unit. 
 Note: Refer to the Participant and Group packets. 
 Note: Describe the logistics of the training. This should include start time, stop time, breaks, 
 location change (if applicable), etc. 
 Note: Ask if there are any questions before continuing. Address all questions. 
 II. POST ORDERS 
 A. General Post Orders 
 Note: Instruct participants to look at their individual packets for specific post orders. 
 Post Orders describe all procedures and any special instructions regarding a specific post. Per 
 Program Statement, Correctional Services Procedures Manual, post orders must be based on 
 Bureau and institution policies, must state each post's duty hours, and must be prepared under 
 the Captain's supervision and direction. 
 Note: Discuss procedures for reviewing and signing post orders in the Lieutenant's office. 
 Discussion: What is the procedure if there is no opportunity to review post orders? 
 In these cases, it is the responsibility of the employee to inform the employer of the fact they 
 have not been able or afforded the opportunity to read such orders. The employer will then 
 advise the employee of the general requirements of the post and answer any questions. 
 Employees assuming posts under these circumstances still have the responsibility of 
 exercising sound correctional judgment based upon their training and experience and will 
 make reasonable efforts to read the post orders as soon as practicable. 
 Note: Refer to the Group Resource Manual. Ask them to take a look at the Title and 
 Location of Post Orders and Post Order Review Sheet noting the areas where signatures are 
 needed. Ask if there are any questions before continuing. 
 Each post order will contain instructions regarding the immediate action an employee should 
 take in an emergency situation. These "first responder" instructions should contain specific 
 action steps including, but not limited to, containment, employee protective considerations, 
 and emergency reporting protocols. Particular requirements regarding assaultive inmates, 
 suicides, fires, evacuation routes, and other "immediate" response emergency situations are 
 addressed and are consistent with the corresponding Emergency Plan. 
 Back 2 Basics 6 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035853
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 B. Specific Post Orders 
 Note: Refer to the Group Resource Manual as needed for the next section. 
 All post orders contain five (5) separate sections in the following order: 
 Section 1: Activities listed chronologically with responsibilities clearly defined. 
 Section 2: Special instructions relating to the specific post. 
 Section 3: General Post Orders - applicable to all posts. 
 Section 4: List of Program Statements and Institution Supplements relevant to the post. 
 Section 5: Employee Signature sheet. 
 Post orders and log books are confidential documents and should never be left unattended or 
 in an area accessible to inmates. They must be secured at all times when not in use by 
 employees. 
 Knowledge Check: Where are the Post Orders located in housing units at this institution? 
 Knowledge Check: Where should you log pertinent information regarding inmates? 
 Note: Ask if there are any questions regarding Post Orders. Upon completion of discussion, 
 continue with instruction. 
 III. ASSUMING DUTIES OF A CORRECTIONAL POST 
 Discussion: What are some of the first things you must do upon arriving? 
 A. Begin Logging Documentation 
 According to the Correctional Services Procedures Manual and our identified post orders, you 
 must begin logging documentation in TRUSCOPE. 
 Items that must be logged upon assuming the post include: 
 • Date 
 • Shift 
 • Base count of the unit (number of inmates) 
 • Your name (printed legibly) 
 • Key ring number 
 • Number of keys 
 • Equipment 
 • Details about the fire alarm panel (indicating if it is operational) 
 Back 2 Basics 7 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035854
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 Knowledge Check: What should you do if the fire alarm panel is not operational? 
 B. Contact Control 
 In addition to logging in the details of equipment, you should contact Control and, with their 
 approval, 
 • conduct a test of your radio/body alarm, and, 
 • verify the unit count. 
 C. Dial in with the Operations Lieutenant 
 Once the base documentation is logged, you may contact the Operations Lieutenant or dial in 
 for a briefing. It is at this time you should address any questions or concerns you may have 
 about the shift. 
 Note: Discuss local procedures for contacting Operations Lieutenant upon assuming duties. 
 IV. ACCOUNTABILITY OF INMATES ON DETAIL 
 Accounting for inmate work detail is a crucial part of inmate accountability as all departments 
 and locations throughout the institution are responsible. If an inmate on your work detail is 
 missing, the inmate is considered 'absent' and you should follow all procedures for locating the 
 absentee inmate. 
 Each detail supervisor should carry the updated and current electronic printout with them 
 throughout the day. 
 Note: Refer to your institution's procedures for printing and collecting Detail/Crew Kit Cards. 
 A. Detail/Crew Kit Cards 
 The Detail Crew Kit on BOPWARE will automatically be updated to reflect new admissions and 
 any job or quarter's changes via SENTRY. Each crew kit has current detail cards on all inmates 
 assigned to the detail. The printouts are never to be left unattended or in an area accessible to 
 inmates. At a minimum, crew kit cards provide: 
 • Names of the inmates; 
 • Register number; 
 • Current photo (a new photo must be made whenever an inmate's appearance changes); 
 • Job assignment; 
 • Quarters assignment; 
 • Custody level; and 
 • Any special conditions. 
 Back 2 Basics 8 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035855
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 Inmates will never be allowed to handle detail/crew kits and/or the cards assigned to the kits. 
 Note: Discuss how to identify an inmate that is on the posted picture file. The inmate is 
 identified with an asterisk. 
 Note: Discuss local procedures for reporting discrepancies in detail/crew kit cards. 
 Note: Discuss the shift/responsibility for collecting the detail/crew kits for your local 
 institution. 
 Note: Discuss the specific location where the detail/crew kits can be found in the housing 
 units (e.g., top drawer in desk of officer's station, etc.). 
 B. Detail Accountability Checks 
 Detail accountability checks are conducted to identify inmates in unauthorized areas, and to 
 determine the presence and accuracy of detail cards (crew kit cards). 
 AM/PM census checks will be documented on Daily Fire and Security Inspection Reports. You 
 must conduct an AM/PM census of all inmates assigned to your area during each work period. 
 Any discrepancies found during the census will be recorded on the inspection report and must 
 be reported to the Operations Lieutenant immediately. 
 C. Excusing Inmates from Detail 
 Knowledge Check: Who can authorize excusing an inmate from work? 
 The Associate Warden overseeing the department maintains the sole authority to "lay in" a 
 Work Detail. Detail Supervisors are not authorized to release inmates from their assigned 
 details prior to the end of normal working hours. 
 As an additional note, Detail Supervisors will not make sick call appointments for inmates. 
 V. LOCATING AN ABSENTEE INMATE 
 If you are responsible for managing the housing unit, it is your responsibility to locate the 
 inmate on your work detail. With that in mind, make proper notifications and take appropriate 
 action against the inmate right away. 
 Knowledge Check: What are the steps to take if inmates are missing or absent from their 
 work? 
 Note: Allow input from employees before continuing. 
 Back 2 Basics 9 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035856
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 Per Program Statement 5500.14, inmates who are missing or absent from their work details 
 should be located in the following manner: 
 1. Take immediate action to locate the inmate if the inmate does not report to work as 
 scheduled within ten (10) minutes or fails to return from an appointment. 
 2. Exhaust all avenues of locating the inmate by calling appointments, the inmate's assigned 
 housing unit, visiting room (if applicable), and Health Services. If the absent inmate cannot 
 be located after ten (10) minutes, notify the Lieutenants Office. At this point, the 
 Lieutenants Office will assume responsibility for locating the inmate. 
 3. The Lieutenant will ensure proper notifications are made and proper action is taken when 
 the inmate is found. 
 Note: Discuss the following in as much detail as needed for your location. 
 A. Daily Change/Transfer Sheet 
 The Daily Change/Transfer Sheet is a SENTRY generated list which denotes changes in an 
 inmate's status. This sheet must be published each regular work day. It includes changes in the 
 following: 
 • Housing unit; 
 • Job assignment; 
 • Medical idle; and/or, 
 • Convalescence which exceeds one (1) day. 
 Note: Identify where and how employees can locate the Daily Change/Transfer Sheet in your 
 local housing units. 
 B. Inmate Callouts 
 The Call-Out sheet lists appointments inmates have with employees and is produced by 
 SENTRY. As you know, it lists the reporting time and physical area where inmates are scheduled 
 to report. The Call-Out sheet is made available to employees and posted in the inmate housing 
 units. The employee who places the inmate on call-out must ensure the requested inmate 
 arrives at the specified time. 
 Discussion: Who is responsible for ensuring the inmate arrives to the callout at the specific 
 time? 
 Note: Identify where and how employees can locate the Inmate Callouts in your local 
 housing units.

 EFTA00034227
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 C. Sick Call 
 Discussion: What are times and days for Sick Call? 
 For Sick Call, inmates will report to the Health Services Department. When an inmate, for 
 medical reasons, is excused from work, Health Services employees will issue two (2) copies of 
 the Medical Idle Authorization to the inmate. The inmate will retain one copy of the idle and 
 deliver the second copy to the Housing Unit Officer. 
 Knowledge Check: Who is responsible for notifying the work supervisor of the inmate's idle 
 status? 
 The Unit Officer will notify the work supervisor of the inmate's idle status. 
 Once an appointment is made, the inmate will return to their unit until the assigned 
 appointment. Inmates will return to Health Services during the assigned movement and remain 
 there until released by the Health Services employees. 
 D. SENTRY 
 Discussion: What are the SENRY functions that may be used for locating an inmate? 
 Some of the most notable options include PP42/PP44, Current Assignments and PP37, History. 
 Note: Discuss any additional SENTRY options, as needed or mentioned by employees. 
 VI. ACTIVITY #1— LOCATING AN ABSENTEE INMATE 
 Note: Distribute the worksheet for Activity #1 — Locating an Absentee Inmate, one (1) per 
 group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes provided. Upon completion, continue 
 instruction. 
 VII. CONDUCTING ROUNDS 
 A. Irregular Rounds 
 Every employee is responsible for the custody, control, supervision, and accountability of all 
 inmates in their area of responsibility and supervision. 
 Housing unit posts should make irregular rounds of the units they are assigned. Although there 
 are no scheduled rounds when moves are open, it is imperative to make rounds for the security 
 and orderly operation of the institution once moves are closed and the unit is locked. Upon 
 completion of each round, notification of completion and any additional notes should be logged 
 Back 2 Basics 11 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035858
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 into TRUSCOPE. 
 Note: Discuss any additional local procedures for conducting rounds. 
 B. Rounds During Lock Down Status in the Housing Unit 
 Per policy, when inmates are in lock down status, rounds must be conducted at least once in 
 the first 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00 a.m. — 12:30 a.m.) followed by another 
 round in the second 30 minute period of the same hour (example, 12:30 a.m. — 1:00 a.m.). This 
 ensures that an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be conducted 
 on an irregular schedule and no more than forty (40) minutes apart. 
 Note: Clearly define lock down status as applicable to housing units during normal 
 operations. 
 VIII. ACTIVITY #2 — CONDUCTING ROUNDS IN THE HOUSING UNIT 
 Note: Distribute the worksheet for Activity #2 — Conducting Rounds in the Housing Unit, one 
 per group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes provided. Upon completion, 
 continue instruction. 
 IX. CONDUCTING FIRE AND SECURITY CHECKS 
 Each detail supervisor or departmental employee will conduct a daily security and fire 
 inspection of their assigned area. The result of these inspections will be submitted on your 
 local Daily or Weekly Security and Fire Inspection Report. Employees will use TRUSCOPE to log 
 in the time conducted and findings, if applicable. 
 The areas listed on the Daily Security and Fire Inspection Report should be completed at the 
 conclusion of each manned shift. 
 Knowledge Check: When should the Daily Fire and Security Checks be conducted? 
 Note: Provide any feedback and/or procedures for your local facility. 
 A. Fire and Security Inspection Report, Daily 
 While managing a housing unit, you will be expected to perform the fire and security inspection 
 in accordance with outlined procedures. Upon completion of the inspection, you will document 
 your findings in TRUSCOPE noting any discrepancies found, along with the action taken to 
 address the problem. If the discrepancy is considered significant or major, you will contact the 
 Lieutenant's office immediately. 
 Note: Refer to the Participant Manual for the Daily Fire and Security Inspection Report.

 Discuss how to document findings once the inspection is completed. 
 B. Security Work Orders/Requests 
 If you find a safety or sanitation issue which requires corrective action, you should note the 
 problem on the form and submit a written work request to get the problem fixed. 
 Note: Identify the location of the work order form and the local procedures for submission. 
 C. Memoranda 
 A memorandum is used to document safety issues encountered during your checks. 
 Discussion: Who should receive a copy of this memorandum? 
 X. ACTIVITY #3 — CONDUCTING FIRE AND SECURITY CHECKS 
 Note: Distribute the worksheet for Activity #3 — Conducting Rounds in the Housing Unit, one 
 (1) per group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes provided. Upon completion, 
 continue instruction. 
 XI. CONDUCTING SEARCHES OF THE HOUSING UNIT 
 A. Searches of the Housing Unit 
 The inspection of a housing unit is primarily designed to detect contraband, prevent escapes, 
 maintain sanitation standards, and to eliminate fire and safety hazards. Frequent and irregular 
 searches should be conducted of all inmate living areas to include: 
 • Cells 
 • Cubicles 
 • Storage rooms 
 • Supply rooms 
 • Common areas 
 • Plumbing accesses 
 • Walls 
 • Plumbing fixtures 
 • Showers, to include drains 
 • Additional locations not mentioned above 
 The employee assigned to the area will be responsible for noting the date, time, results, and

 will be conducted frequently and properly documented in TRUSCOPE. 
 Back 2 Basics 13 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035860
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 Note: Identify how searches of the housing unit should be documented at your local facility. 
 Approaches to conduct searches in all areas of the housing unit include: 
 1. Visual 
 A visual inspection must be conducted inside the unit for items such as bent or spread bars, 
 broken welds, cracked or cut bars, and any sign of steel filings. Any other evidence of 
 tampering or weakness such as fresh paint or discolored areas is to be thoroughly investigated. 
 2. Bar Tapping 
 Accurate bar taps call for the use of a mallet to tap security bars and frames to set up vibrations 
 which, by their deviation from normal sound, would indicate tampering or weakness. All 
 housing unit bars within the institution will be tapped weekly, and this information should be 
 recorded accordingly. 
 Note: Discuss procedures for recording bar taps at your local institution. 
 3. Metal Instrument 
 A thin instrument such a putty knife can be passed along frames or bars to locate cuts or 
 depressions which might indicate tampering. The instrument can also be used as a probe to 
 uncover cuts filled with soap, putty, or other substances. 
 Knowledge Check: How often are bar taps completed? 
 Note: Explain the location and/or procedures for obtaining tools used for conducting 
 searches. 
 4. Mirror 
 A mirror is an effective instrument for examining areas that would ordinarily be difficult to 
 inspect. A mirror may be used to inspect any area that ordinarily would be difficult to observe 
 during a routine visual inspection. 
 Knowledge Check: What areas in the housing units are best searched using a mirror? 
 B. Searches of Inmate Cells 
 Employees may search an inmate's housing area and any personal items contained within an 
 area, without prior notice, inmate approval, or inmate's presence. An inmate will be removed 
 from the cell and searched prior to the cell search. When conducting the cell search, all items 
 Back 2 Basics 14 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035861
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 in the cell should be carefully searched and, as nearly as possible, returned to their original 
 order upon completion. 
 When conducting a cell search, particular attention must be paid to the following: 
 • Plumbing facilities 
 • Ventilation ducts 
 • Beds 
 • Bedding 
 • Chairs 
 • Commissary items 
 • Books 
 • Additional items/locations not mentioned above 
 False shoe bottoms, secret compartments and hollow legs are possibilities for concealing 
 contraband. 
 Discussion: What are some other common areas for concealing contraband that have not 
 been mentioned? 
 The employee searching the cell will be responsible for noting the date, time, inmate's name, 
 inmate's register number, cell/room number, results, and name of searching employee in 
 TRUSCOPE. 
 Identify how cell searches should be documented at your local facility. 
 C. Contraband 
 Here are only a few items of contraband and locations it may be commonly found in the 
 housing units: 
 • Cell phones hidden in doors 
 • Cell phones hidden inside of soda cans 
 • Cell phones hidden in soap 
 • Cigarettes hidden in all areas of inmate cells 
 • Tattoo Kits hidden in soda cans 
 • Contraband safes made out of Ramen Noodles 
 • Handcuff Keys made from inhalers 
 • Homemade intoxicants in all areas of the housing units 
 • Homemade tobacco pipes 
 • Officer safety items hidden as contraband 
 • Secret contraband storage spaces 
 • Shanks created from printer cartridges 
 Back 2 Basics 15 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035862
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 • Tobacco and other items hidden in Bibles 
 Note: Discuss additional contraband items and locations. 
 When conducting searches of inmates, housing units, and cells, it is important to be familiar 
 with items inmates may and may not have. When in doubt, you can refer to the local 
 Commissary List and/or the Inmate Personal Property List. You may also ask the inmate to 
 provide a receipt of purchased items. 
 Note: Inform participants to refer to the local Commissary Sheet and/or Inmate Personal 
 Property List in the Participant Manual as needed. 
 Knowledge Check: What would you do if you found an item you suspected was contraband 
 but wasn't completely sure? 
 1. Areas Approved for Inmate Property Storage 
 Inmates in the general population housing units will be issued specific locations for the storage 
 of personal property, for example, lockers. Items authorized outside of the areas may include 
 items such as: 
 • One (1) mesh laundry bag 
 • Footwear 
 • Issued clothing 
 Property storage may not be in offices of the unit team or the correctional supervisor except in 
 temporary, emergency situations.

 Back 2 Basics 16 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035863
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 Note: Discuss local procedures for identifying and logging contraband recovered during 
 searches. 
 XII. ACTIVITY #4 — CONDUCTING SEARCHES OF THE HOUSING UNITS AND INMATE CELLS 
 Note: Distribute the worksheet for Activity #4 — Conducting Searches of the Housing Units 
 and Inmate Cells, one (1) per group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes 
 provided. Upon completion, continue instruction. 
 XIII. CONDUCTING BED BOOK AUDITS 
 Knowledge Check: When should employees conduct a bed book audit? 
 Note: Allow participants to provide feedback. Provide feedback for your local facility. 
 A minimum of one (1) bed book audit will be conducted every 24-hour period to ensure the 
 accuracy of inmate assignments. 
 Note: Provide information on where/how the Bed Book is retrieved/located at your local 
 facility. 
 The Bed Book contains the following information for each inmate: 
 • Inmate's name 
 • Register number 
 • Cell location 
 • Job assignment 
 • Custody level 
 • Any additional information (e.g., medical information) 
 Bed Book Cards are strictly confidential and should never be viewed by inmates. 
 A. Procedures for Conducting a Bed Book Count 
 At least two (2) employees will conduct bed book audits. Inmates must be positively identified 
 using printed pictures, by asking the inmates to state both their name and register number. 
 Both employees must agree the inmate matches the picture, name, and register number on the 
 bed book card. Inmates must also be in their assigned cell as documented in the bed book and 
 unit SENTRY roster. 
 The first employee will carry the SENTRY roster while the second employee will carry the Bed 
 Book picture roster. Upon completing count, both officers verify all inmates are present, 
 compare the numbers with each of the counting employee, and identify any inmates not 
 Back 2 Basics 17 Managing Housing Units, Part I 
 EFTA00035864
FY2024 BACK 2 BASICS Instructor Guide 
 present in the housing unit. 
 Note: Discuss local procedures for conducting a Bed Book Count. 
 Employees will then call Control Center and verify this information. 
 B. Updating an Inmate's Picture Card 
 Discussion: What issues warrant the update of a picture card? 
 When conducting a Bed Book count, you may discover that an inmate has changed their 
 physical appearance. If this is the case, the following standard operating procedures should 
 occur: 
 1. Find correct inmate Picture Card on file. 
 2. Write and submit a memorandum to the Unit Team requesting a new picture be taken and 
 explain why. 
 3. Use reverse side of Picture Card to note changes in the inmate's physical appearance. 
 4. Return Picture Card file to proper secure location. 
 Knowledge Check: Who can request the update of a picture card? 
 Any employee can submit the request for an inmate's picture card to be updated. The same 
 procedures mentioned above will apply to any employee submitting the request. 
 1. Locate inmate's Picture Card. 
 2. Record information from inmate's Picture Card into assigned bed/cell slot in unit Bed Book. 
 3. File inmate's Picture Card with your unit cards. 
 XIV. SUMMARY

 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 2 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035882
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 I. INTRODUCTION 
 Slide 1- Conducting Searches 
 Since inmates often possess different types of contraband, find ways to modify government-
 issued items inappropriately, and create weapons out of any type of material, inmates and all 
 areas of our institution must be searched routinely at irregular times. Conducting searches is 
 an important part of a correctional workers duties and responsibilities. This lesson provides the 
 information you will need to perform a thorough search of inmates and all areas that inmates 
 have access. Our objectives for this lesson are: 
 Slide 2 — Objectives 
 • Identify the purpose and importance of conducting searches. 
 • Identify the general guidelines for conducting searches. 
 • Given an inmate living area, an institution space or open area, and search equipment, each 
 participant will conduct pat and area searches. 
 • Identify the proper sequence of steps used in conducting a visual search, as delineated in 
 this course of instruction. 
 Slide 3 - Reasons for Conducting Searches 
 II. CONDUCTING SEARCHES 
 A. Reasons for conducting searches 
 There are critical reasons for conducting searches which relate to safety and well-being. It is 
 important to remember searches are not conducted for the purpose of harassing inmates. 
 Reasons that searches are conducted are to: 
 1. Protect staff and inmates 
 The most important reason for conducting searches is to protect employees and inmates. 
 Searches help us maintain a safe and secure environment for everyone. 
 2. Detect and remove contraband 
 Contraband may be a restricted item or an excessive amount of permitted items. Searches 
 allow staff members to locate and remove contraband items. 
 3. Prevent escapes 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 3 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035883
Agri! 2015 Instructor Guide 
 Through searches, staff may uncover tools or devices that could be used in an escape attempt. 
 Staff members also inspect buildings and structures for signs of tampering. 
 4. Maintain sanitary standards 
 Institution areas must be kept neat and clean for health purposes. Searches ensure sanitary 
 conditions meet established standards. 
 5. Eliminate fire and safety hazards 
 Area searches help uncover fire and safety hazards such as exposed or faulty electrical wires. 
 When such hazards are discovered, they must be reported for repair. 
 Slide 4 - Reference Materials 
 B. Reference Materials 
 Your primary references for conducting searches will be PS 5500.11,Correctional Services 
 Manual and Program Statement 5521.05, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work 
 Areas. These sources provide thorough coverage as follows: 
 1. The Correctional Services Manual provides guidance on records and methods of inspection. 
 It also provides guidance to search visually and how to use instruments during a search. For 
 example, it tells how to use a mallet for tapping and how to use metal instruments to check for 
 cuts or other signs of tampering. 
 Detailed instructions for searching inmates and specific areas such as housing units, utility 
 rooms, shops, and buildings are also provided. 
 2. The PS 5521.05, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas explains how 
 and why search procedures are established. It also outlines documentation requirements for 
 searches. 
 3. Local Procedures such as the list of items carried by our institution Commissary and the list 
 of locally authorized inmate personal property are two other important sources of information. 
 You can use these lists to help you tell the difference between authorized items and nuisance 
 contraband. 
 Slide 5 - Search Conditions 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 4 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035884
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 C. Search Conditions 
 It is important you understand the conditions under which searches are conducted. In this 
 section, we will discuss when these searches are performed and who is authorized to perform 
 them. 
 • When to conduct searches? 
 Searches are performed according to scheduled Post Orders and/or supervisory instructions. 
 Searches may be performed any time of the day or night, during any shift. They may be 
 scheduled or unscheduled. 
 • Who may conduct searches? 
 All staff members are authorized and encouraged to perform random searches. In certain 
 institution areas such as the living quarters, dining hall, Health Services Department, or library, 
 specific staff may be assigned to conduct a search. Any staff member may be asked to search a 
 specific inmate or area at any time. 
 Slide 6 - Types of Searches 
 III. TYPES OF SEARCHES 
 Now that we have discussed why searches are performed, sources for additional information, 
 and search conditions, we will move on to the actual steps for conducting various searches. 
 Slide 7 - Types of Searches - Area Searches 
 A. Area Searches 
 1. Initiate the search 
 First, determine the type of search to be conducted. You can do this by following your Post 
 Orders and/or contacting your supervisor. In general, searches are performed as follows: 
 • Daily security inspections are conducted during each shift. 
 • Searches of living quarters or individual cells are conducted daily on a routine and random 
 basis. 
 • Searches of other areas (such as UNICOR, education building, electrical shop, library, or 
 yard) are conducted daily on an irregular time schedule. 
 • Institution grounds inspections are conducted frequently on an irregular schedule. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 5 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035885
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 Note: Show an Institution Search Log. 
 If appropriate, determine the specific living quarters/cell to be searched by referring to the unit 
 or area search log book located at the Unit Officer's station. The search log book identifies all 
 areas/cells recently searched and the contraband found and documented by the staff member. 
 Referring to the unit or area search log book prior to conducting a search may help eliminate 
 different staff searching the same area or cell on different shifts. It also helps to identify other 
 areas in need of searching and reduces the appearance of harassing a particular inmate. 
 2. Obtain search tools 
 The right tools make a search job much simpler, safer, and more effective. Used correctly, the 
 recommended tools will help you uncover concealed evidence without putting yourself in 
 danger. 
 Note: Display tools used in searches. 
 Obtain any necessary tools before you begin an area search: 
 • Screwdrivers (Phillips head and flat head) to disassemble equipment or other items. 
 • Mirrors with a long handle to look under, over, or behind objects. 
 • A flashlight to see under furniture, equipment, or other dark areas. 
 • Appropriate keys to open locks and lockers. 
 • Probing devices to check dense areas such as the ground. 
 • A mallet to tap items such as bars and grilles. It can also be used to inspect walls where 
 paint chips are detected. 
 • A putty knife to check window sashes, sills, and bars. The knife can also be used to inspect 
 hidden areas, such as the ledge behind a piece of heavy furniture. 
 • A hand-held metal detector to find concealed contraband items, such as knives or razor 
 blades in a mattress, pillow, or clothing. 
 3. Dealing with the presence of inmates 
 Inmates are not allowed to observe a search or to remain in an area which is being searched. 
 If inmates are in the area to be searched, pat search them and direct them to leave the area. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 6 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035886
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 Note: Inmate pat searches will be discussed later in this lesson plan. 
 4. Plan a systematic search process. 
 Area searches must be conducted in a thorough, systematic manner. They are not random spot 
 checks. 
 The area search process is detailed and careful preparation is necessary. Think of the plan you 
 will develop as a road map for your area search. Prepare a plan for the area being searched. Be 
 sure the plan is thorough and systematic. 
 • How do you plan to tackle this assignment? What approach will you take? 
 • Assess the area to be searched. What is the size of the area? Where are the doors and 
 windows? 
 • Look over the actual area to be searched. Establish an overall impression and identify 
 anything suspicious. Check all parts of the area thoroughly, but also try to imagine yourself 
 as an inmate. Where would you hide something? 
 • Select a starting point and determine a systematic approach. You may start anywhere, but 
 search the entire area systematically to ensure thorough coverage. For example, you may 
 enter at the cell door and search from the left, inspecting all items from top to bottom. 
 5. Inspecting the area and all contents 
 Note: Describe Typical Hiding Locations. 
 a. Review search strategy. 
 Keep the following points in mind as you begin your search: 
 • Follow your search plan. Even if you find contraband, you must continue searching until 
 you have covered the entire area. Contraband may have been planted in several places. 
 Sometimes, a minor contraband item is planted to bait and distract you from a more serious 
 article. 
 • Plan to conduct your search so all legitimate articles and bedding may be left as neat and 
 orderly as you found them at the beginning of the search. 
 • Focus on maintaining your concentration throughout the search. This is a detailed task and 
 it is important you keep your mind on what you are doing.

 Inmates may conceal contraband such as needles, razor blades, tattoo paraphernalia, and other 
 sharp objects out of plain view of staff. For this reason, use extreme caution to never run 
 hands along a surface they have not visually inspected, and remember to never put hands or 
 fingers anywhere you cannot see. 
 Avoid squeezing inmate clothing and laundry items to avoid injury in the event that contraband 
 may be concealed in these items. Always visually inspect, unfold, and shake these items prior 
 to searching. Further prevention strategies include the use of the search tools mentioned 
 above. 
 If contraband is, in fact, discovered, be cautious. Always use a search tool to pick up needles, 
 razor blades, or other sharp objects. When transporting these types of contraband, continue to 
 use caution by placing the items in a sharps container, when applicable. 
 (2) Exposure to Blood borne Pathogens. 
 Exposed employees must report all exposures to their immediate supervisor as soon as 
 possible. Prompt reporting of exposure incidents ensures timely medical evaluation and follow-
 up. If evaluation of the circumstances indicates post-exposure treatment, the exposed 
 employee will benefit from the prompt initiation of treatment. 
 c. Search the area. 
 Check all movable or installed items and equipment. Use tools as appropriate to search 
 inaccessible areas and protect yourself. For example, use the mirror, probe, or metal detector 
 to check inaccessible areas. Take note of unusual circumstances or needed repairs. 
 (1) Inspect all furniture. Concentrate on hollow legs, cracks, and crevices; underside; and any 
 upholstered cushions. 
 • Check beds and upholstered furniture thoroughly. 
 • Strip the bed. Examine all pillows, sheets, covers, blankets, and the mattress carefully. 
 Check to see if contraband has been pinned or sewn to any item. 
 • Search the mattress, pillows, and cushions for hard objects. Consider using the metal 
 detector to protect yourself from sharp items such as needles and blades.

April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 • Check the underside of all furniture such as chairs, tables, and stools. Look for taped or 
 stuck items and small holes bored into the wood. Contraband could be plugged into holes 
 by paper or wooden plugs. 
 (2) Inspect any plumbing fixtures such as toilets, wash basins, shower stalls, water fountains, 
 and ice machines. Concentrate on the legs, cracks, and crevices; the underside and inside of all 
 water -holding devices. Ensure you: 
 • Flush toilets and look for suspicious water flow. 
 • Drain water, if possible. Run fresh water to check for contraband hidden in pipes. 
 • Inspect drains. Remove drain grilles where possible, and look for contraband suspended on 
 thin wire or thread. 
 (3) Inspect ventilation devices. Remove ventilation grilles where possible and look for 
 contraband suspended on thin wire or thread. 
 (4) Inspect electrical fixtures. Remove light fixture covers, light bulbs, and electrical face 
 plates. 
 (5) Inspect doors, windows, bars, and wall surfaces. Concentrate on cracks, crevices, locks, 
 caulking, recent repairs, and bars that have been bent, broken, or tampered with. 
 (6) Inspect mechanical equipment. Ensure power to equipment is turned off before you open 
 and inspect it. 
 (7) Inspect all items and materials stored in area. 
 Ensure you: 
 • Check all personal items such as picture frames, toothpaste, and medicine containers. 
 • Look for expired medications or those issued to an inmate other than the one whose locker 
 you are checking. Look for false bottoms and examine contents. 
 • Check all institution items such as trash cans, brooms, and cleaning utensils/supplies. 
 • Inspect all packaging, such as soap bars. Ensure the seals have not been tampered with. If 
 seals have been opened, check contents carefully. 
 • Inspect all books, magazines, and papers within the area. Check the bindings and covers. 
 Look between individual pages.

 • Confiscate all contraband found in the area. Remember to follow the proper procedures for 
 the confiscation of contraband and inmate personal property. 
 Note: Review procedures for confiscating contraband. 
 In outdoor areas concentrate on recently transplanted trees, shrubs, and flowers. Check areas 
 where repairs have caused soil displacement. The dense undergrowth creates an ideal 
 hiding/burial spot. 
 • Drive probes into the ground in recently planted areas. Investigate suspicious areas. 
 • Use hand-held metal detectors to check for weapons and other contraband. 
 6. Leave the area as you found it. 
 As we discussed, area searches are necessary in institution life. However, a little consideration 
 on your part will go a long way in helping inmates accept the intrusion. Treat their property 
 with respect by: 
 • Ensuring the area is returned to its original condition as neatly as possible. There should be 
 little evidence that a search was performed. 
 • Folding bedding items neatly and place them on the bed. Staff members are not required 
 to remake an inmate's bed after removing all bed clothing while conducting a search. 
 • Replacing personal items to the approximate location they were found prior to the search. 
 Remember that a cell is an inmate's home. 
 7. Document the search. 
 Each time you complete a search, you must complete the necessary documentation. Complete 
 a log entry to document your actions and findings. If necessary, write a memorandum and/or 
 an Incident Report. 
 (1) living quarters 
 Note: Display Unit Search Log. 
 • If you find contraband, remove it from the living quarters. Tell your supervisor, and 
 determine appropriate actions to take regarding confiscation and disposal of contraband. 
 • Document your search in the Unit Search Log. (It is important to document the fact that 
 you conducted a search, whether or not you found contraband.) This documentation

April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 proves the Bureau of Prisons is doing everything it can to make the institution safe and 
 secure. 
 Note: Refer to Appendix. 
 If you find hard contraband or contraband of significance, you must document your findings as 
 follows: 
 • If your finding can be directly attributed to one inmate, complete an Incident Report. In 
 addition, if you know of any recent event or sensitive information that may relate to your 
 finding, write a memorandum to your shift supervisor to support the Incident Report. 
 • If your finding cannot be attributed to a single inmate, write a memorandum to the Captain 
 through your shift supervisor. 
 All Incident Reports and memorandums should include the following information: 
 • Name and register number of the inmate whose cell was searched 
 • Number of the cell searched 
 • Name of the officer conducting the search 
 • Time of search 
 • List of any contraband discovered 
 • Disposition of the contraband 
 (2) areas outside living quarters 
 • If you find contraband, remove it from the area. Tell your supervisor, and determine 
 appropriate actions to take regarding confiscation and disposal of contraband. 
 Note: Explain how to complete a log book entry. 
 • Document your search in the area log or lieutenant's log. (It is important to document the 
 fact you conducted a search and whether contraband was found.) 
 • If you found hard contraband or contraband of significance, write a memorandum. If your 
 finding can be directly attributed to an inmate, complete an Incident Report. 
 8. Submit work requests 
 During your search, you may find areas that need repair and/or further inspection. Perhaps you 
 noticed plumbing or structural problems. In such cases you should submit a work request. 
 Note: Describe local procedures used to submit work orders.

 9. Practice area search 
 We have discussed the fundamentals of conducting an area search. Now you will have the 
 opportunity to practice what you have just learned. 
 Note: Assign the participants to conduct a limited area search of identified areas. Observe the participants as 
 they conduct this exercise to ensure they are using proper search techniques. Provide feedback as 
 needed. 
 Note: Did you have any problems with completing the area search? Did you find anything which requires an 
 Incident Report, a Work Request, or memorandum? How would you document the area search? 
 Encourage discussion. 
 Slide 8 - Types of Searches - Pat Searches 
 B. Pat searches 
 1. When to conduct pat searches? 
 • Staff may conduct a pat search of an inmate on a routine or random basis to control 
 contraband. 
 • Inmates should be pat searched several times a day at non-scheduled intervals. 
 • Inmates should be randomly pat searched when they move from one area of the institution 
 to another. For example: pat searches should be conducted during open movements, 
 entering or exiting inmate housing units, when inmates leave a work assignment, or when 
 they return to the work site after a scheduled call-out, religious activity, etc. Inmates must 
 assume a pat search will be conducted at any time and any place. Inmates must be 
 uncertain as to when, where and how they will be questioned and searched. 
 2. Who conducts pat searches? 
 A pat search may be conducted by any staff member, at any time, and on any inmate of either 
 gender. 
 3. Pat Searches of Staff and Inmate Visitors 
 The following procedures apply to searching staff and inmate visitors, both social and legal, 
 official visitors, contractors, and volunteers, upon entering Bureau grounds or facilities. 
 Persons refusing to submit to or comply with authorized Bureau search procedures will be 
 denied entry or required to leave. 
 A pat search of an inmate visitor or staff member will be conducted in the same manner as an 
 inmate pat search with the following exceptions: 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 12 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035892
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 • Except in emergencies, pat searches of visitors/staff must be conducted by staff of the same 
 sex as the non-inmate being searched. 
 • Religious headwear is not considered part of a visitor's/staff's belongings, but rather their 
 person. Random pat searches should NOT ordinarily include removal and inspection of 
 religious headwear. Except in emergencies, Warden authorization is required before staff 
 perform pat or visual searches of religious headwear. Searches of religious headwear 
 should be conducted out of the view of other visitors and inmates. 
 • Religious headwear that obscures a person's face must be removed sufficiently to reveal the 
 face for identification upon entering and leaving facilities, and does not require the 
 heightened conditions described above or documentation. In these cases, the entire 
 headwear need not be removed if partial removal will reveal the face for identification. 
 • Staff must be respectful of the belongings of others. Belongings and contents should not be 
 handled carelessly, or in a manner that attracts unnecessary attention by others in the area. 
 • Staff should not make unnecessary or inappropriate comments regarding their belongings 
 that might cause embarrassment. 
 • All containers—for example, purses, backpacks, and medication (prescription or over-the-
 counter)— must be electronically screened or opened and inspected. 
 Note: Pat Search Video 
 4. Pat search video 
 Before we get into the process of a pat search, I want to show you a video on the procedures 
 we will be following. Please observe each step closely as these are the steps we will be 
 following and on which you will be tested. 
 Note: Direct the participants to remove the Pat Search Job Aids from the Appendix of their manuals. 
 5. Initiate the pat search 
 • Determine which inmate is to be searched. 
 • Determine the location of the search. 
 • Communicate your intentions to the inmate. 
 Note: The presence of other inmates should not be a deterrent to performing an effective pat search.

 6. Systematic steps in conducting a pat search 
 The pat search is conducted utilizing a systematic step-by-step approach to ensure maximum 
 effectiveness. During the performance evaluation, you must complete the pat search in the 
 systematic order taught. 
 Slide 9 - Types of Searches - Pat Search 
 7. Conducting the pat search 
 a. Pat search positioning 
 While conducting a pat search, staff must remain alert to their surroundings and the inmate at 
 all times. For safety, it is imperative that staff be aware of their positioning as well as the 
 inmate's positioning throughout the pat search. 
 (1) Inmate Positioning 
 • The inmate will face away from the staff member during all hands-on search procedures. 
 • While facing away from the staff member, the inmate will be instructed to stretch out their 
 arms perpendicular to the inmate's side and parallel to the ground with palms facing up and 
 fingers spread. 
 • The staff member will instruct the inmate to place their feet shoulder width apart. 
 • Throughout the pat search, the inmate will be instructed to turn. While the inmate is 
 turning the staff member remains in place monitoring the inmate's actions. 
 (2) Staff Member Positioning 
 • The staff member will maintain a T-stance while conducting the pat search. 
 • The staff member's head should never pass the plane of the inmate's side. (Example: Do 
 not allow your head to be in a position where the inmate could strike with an elbow, arm or 
 fist). 
 • Larger inmates may require a staff member to move from one side to the other while 
 searching the chest and waist area. The staff member will stay behind the inmate's 
 outstretched arms at all times. 
 • While searching the lower extremities, the staff member should maintain their T-stance 
 while going to one knee. Never place both knees on the ground at the same time.

 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035894
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 b. Removal of inmate's personal items 
 • Direct the inmate to remove all items from their pockets. Instruct the inmate to place the 
 items in a specific location (out of reach). Inspect the inmate's hands to ensure there is no 
 concealed contraband in the hand or between the fingers. When conducting this 
 procedure, observe the inmate's body language and movements, noting signs of anxiety or 
 any attempt to throw away contraband. 
 • Direct the inmate to remove any head wear (hats, clips, head bands, barrettes, or hair 
 ornaments) and place it with the items removed from their pockets. 
 c. Inspect the inmate's head and neck 
 As part of a thorough pat search, you will start at the head and work your way down the 
 inmate's body to the feet. However, there may be times that the inspection of the head will 
 not be necessary. 
 • Direct the inmate to lean forward and run their fingers vigorously through the hair several 
 times to dislodge any hidden contraband items. 
 d. Searching the inmate's arms and upper torso 
 • Have the inmate turn and face away from you, raise their arms to the side, shoulder high 
 with fingers spread, and palms facing up. From behind, visually look at the inmate's hands 
 to ensure there is nothing concealed. 
 • Search the inmate's collar by placing the collar material between your index finger and 
 thumb, using both hands. Press the material, feeling for hidden contraband. Be sure to 
 cover the entire length of the collar. 
 • In a systematic method, search one shoulder, arm, and armpit at a time. Begin at the 
 shoulder area with one hand flat against the back of the shoulder and the other flat against 
 the front of the shoulder. Pressing the palms against the inmate's body and using a 
 sweeping motion, work your hands from the shoulder to the wrist ensuring total coverage 
 of the shoulder, armpit, and length of the arm. While searching the inmate's arms and 
 upper torso, use a sweeping motion; do not squeeze or give the appearance of groping. 
 Larger inmates may require a staff member to use a rotational sweeping motion in order to 
 ensure all areas are properly searched. 
 • Repeat this procedure to search the other shoulder, armpit, and arm. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 15 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035895
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 • With your palms flat and thumbs aligned on each side of the spine, search the inmate's back 
 and sides by pressing down as you work your way to the inmate's belt line. Considering the 
 size of the inmate, this portion of the search may require more than one sweeping motion. 
 • Go back to the armpit area. With both palms flat against the inmate's side, using a 
 sweeping motion, search each side simultaneously down to the belt line. 
 (1) Male Inmate 
 • Once the back and sides have been completed, search the chest and stomach from behind. 
 • Place both palms flat on the inmate's chest, near the top of the chest. In a downward 
 sweeping motion, paying close attention to seams, button areas, and pockets, search to the 
 inmate's belt line. 
 (2) Female Inmate 
 • Have the inmate lower one arm (your choice). 
 • Place yourself to the side of her lowered arm, place your inside arm (forearm) in a position 
 which affords protection of your groin, preventing the inmate from raising her arm. 
 • With your outside hand in a position with all four fingers and thumb extended and joined 
 together, and held in a vertical position, place the thumb side of your hand on the chest 
 area starting at or above the sternum. Run your hand downward, circling under the breast, 
 then upwards toward the armpit area, applying enough pressure to detect any contraband. 
 • Check the abdomen area with the flat palm portion of the searching hand. 
 • Repeat the above procedures for the other side. 
 Larger inmates may require a staff member to move from one side to the other while searching 
 the chest. Stay behind the inmate's outstretched arms at all times. 
 e. Searching the belt line and waistband areas 
 • This is a common area to hide sharp items - exercise caution when searching this area! 
 • With the inmate's arms raised to the side, shoulder high, search the waistband of the 
 inmate. Standing to the rear of the inmate, reach around the waist and begin at the navel 
 area. Placing the trouser material between your fingers and thumb, pinch the material, 
 working your way from the front to the rear on both sides, simultaneously. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 16 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035896
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 • Once the waistband has been completed, using the same technique, search the belt. 
 • Larger inmates may require a staff member to move from one side to the other while 
 searching the belt and waistband. Stay behind the inmate's outstretched arms at all times. 
 Slide 10 - Types of Searches - Pat Search 
 f. Searching the lower abdomen and groin 
 • Search the inmate's lower abdomen and groin area. This is accomplished by placing the 
 palm flat, directly below the inmate's waistband, on the lower abdomen, with fingers 
 aligned with the zipper. The other hand, the palm is flat, placed directly below the 
 waistband on the inmate's buttocks. Move your hands downward in a sweeping motion 
 toward the crotch area. 
 • Pay special attention to the inmate's lower abdomen and crotch, carefully checking seams, 
 waistbands, zippers, and buttons. 
 Note: Explain to the participants to thoroughly search the crotch area, using a sweeping motion; do not 
 squeeze or give the appearance of groping. 
 g. Searching the legs 
 • In a systematic method, search one leg at a time. Pressing the palms against the inmate's 
 leg and using a sweeping motion, work your hands from the crotch area to the ankle. While 
 searching the inmate's legs, use a sweeping motion; do not squeeze or give the appearance 
 of groping. Larger inmates may require a staff member to use a rotational sweeping 
 motion in order to ensure all areas are properly searched. 
 h. Searching the socks and shoes 
 • Inspect the shoe tops, and any area of the leg/ankle covered by socks. If you feel there is 
 contraband, the inmate should be removed to an appropriate area for a visual search. 
 • Remaining behind the inmate, move to the other side. Repeat the procedure to search the 
 other side of the inmate's lower abdomen, groin, leg, and shoe. 
 • Instruct the inmate to lift each foot, one at a time, showing you the bottom of the shoe. 
 Visually inspect the bottoms of the shoes to ensure there is no item of contraband 
 concealed on the bottom. Examine shoes closely for any split soles or removable heels. 
 • Once the inmate has been searched, have the inmate lower their arms.

 • Inspect items removed from the inmate's pockets by visually and physically checking each, 
 disassembling as necessary. 
 • Inspect head wear for concealed items by running your fingers over material, folding down 
 and checking under all hat bands and head bands. 
 • Direct the inmate to retrieve their personal possessions. 
 • Release the inmate to their assigned duty. 
 j. Documenting confiscated contraband 
 You have learned how to document confiscated contraband. Let's review the forms used in 
 documenting confiscated contraband: 
 • Confiscation and Disposition of Contraband form 
 • Incident Report 
 • Memorandum 
 Slide 11 - Pat Search Special Concerns 
 9. Pat search special concerns 
 a. Casts and artificial limbs 
 Dangerous weapons, drugs, and money are often concealed in casts and artificial limbs. 
 • Inspect any plaster cast or artificial limb the inmate may have by using a flashlight and 
 mirror. If you suspect the plaster cast conceals contraband, contact your supervisor for 
 further instructions. 
 • Inspect any artificial limb the inmate may be wearing by directing them to remove the limb 
 and thoroughly searching the limb and all attaching hardware. This will be done in private. 
 • Contact the Health Services Department if problems arise when searching inmates with 
 either casts or artificial limbs. 
 b. Dealing with the inmate 
 Most inmates accept pat searches as a part of the normal day. Even so, you must: 
 • Respect the inmate's right to not be harassed. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 18 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035898
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 • Be systematic when performing the pat search. 
 • Maintain professionalism by conducting all searches in a calm, no-nonsense manner. 
 • Remain alert at all times. Remember, keeping contraband out depends on how well you do 
 your job. Others depend on you. 
 c. If you suspect contraband or a weapon 
 We must ensure our own safety while conducting searches. When contraband is suspected, 
 you should have a second staff member assisting with the search. 
 (1) Direct the inmate to face away from you with arms extended, palms up, and feet apart. 
 (2) You may want to instruct the inmate to assume a position against a wall if possible. 
 • Arms outstretched and palms of the hands on the wall. 
 • Legs spread more than shoulder width. 
 • Move feet away from the wall. 
 (3) Request assistance and have the inmate submit to a visual search. 
 Note: Direct participants to refer to the Job Aids located in the Appendix. 
 9. Practice pat search 
 The instructor will demonstrate the proper pat search technique with a volunteer member of 
 the class or a member of the instructional team. Following the demonstration, each participant 
 should be required to properly perform a thorough pat search on another participant. 
 Note: The instructor should hide contraband on the person who is being searched. Using the evaluation form 
 located in the Instructor Guide's Appendix to rate the participant's performance and provide feedback. 
 C. Visual Search 
 Slide 12 — Visual Search 
 The intent of the pat search is to control the introduction of contraband in our institutions, 
 ensuring a safe environment for staff and inmates. Pat searches do not detect all contraband; 
 however, this important security procedure will assist in deterring the introduction and 
 movement of contraband. If you suspect the inmate may possess contraband, which you did 
 not detect during your pat search, you should initiate a visual search. We must ensure our own 
 safety while conducting searches. If the staff member conducting the search believes they are 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 19 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035899
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 at particular risk, they should immediately seek assistance. Staff should not try to remove any 
 contraband from the inmate without a second staff member present. 
 In a recorded case an inmate undergoing a visual search was found to have a greasy substance 
 around his rectum. A digital and simple instrument search located an item, but the item could 
 not be removed from the inmate's bowels. An x-ray revealed that the item was a small-caliber 
 pistol. When the pistol was finally recovered, it was found that it did not have a trigger guard 
 and that it was fully loaded! The pistol could have discharged at any time. The inmate had 
 received the pistol and inserted it into his rectum while in the Visiting Room. A very alert 
 Correctional Officer performing a professional visual search prevented this weapon from 
 entering the institution. 
 The visual search is probably the most sensitive search procedure you will conduct. As the 
 name implies, a visual search involves the visual inspection of an inmate's body after all clothing 
 has been removed. Unlike the pat search, staff members should never touch an inmate while 
 conducting a visual search. 
 Inmates may view visual searches as humiliating and feel it can be a form of harassment. 
 Visual searches are extremely effective in preventing the introduction and circulation of 
 contraband. As a correctional worker, a visual search is one of the many areas of your job that 
 will test your professionalism. 
 1. Purpose of a visual search 
 Visual searches are conducted to protect staff members and inmates by controlling the 
 introduction and conveyance of contraband into the institution. 
 a. When to conduct visual search 
 (1) Conduct a visual search when there is reasonable belief that contraband may be concealed 
 on the inmate. 
 (2) Conduct a visual search when a good opportunity for concealment has occurred. 
 (3) Based on the security level of the institution, conduct a visual search when an inmate is 
 entering or leaving the: 
 • Visiting Room 
 • Institution 
 • Special Housing Unit 
 (4) Conduct a visual search when an inmate has been apprehended after an escape or an 
 escape attempt.

 EFTA00035900
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 b. Who may conduct a visual search? 
 (1) A routine visual search is conducted by staff members of the same sex as the inmate. 
 (2) A staff member of the opposite sex may conduct the search in an emergency situation. The 
 staff member must be fully prepared to articulate their actions and be able to document the 
 conditions and reasons for the opposite sex search. A copy of the report will be placed in the 
 inmate's central file. 
 2. Systematic steps in conducting a visual search 
 a. Initiating the visual search 
 (1) Determine which inmate is to be searched. 
 (2) Determine where the inmate is to be searched by locating an area out of public view, 
 maintaining the inmate's dignity to the maximum extent possible. 
 (3) Notify the inmate by verbally stating your intention to visually search them, and direct the 
 inmate to the area where the search will take place. 
 Slide 13 - Visual Search 
 b. Conducting the visual search 
 (1) Direct the inmate to remove all items from clothing pockets. 
 • Direct the inmate where to place personal items. 
 • Ensure the items are placed out of reach of the inmate. 
 (2) Direct the inmate to remove all clothes. 
 • As the inmate removes their clothes, watch for signs of anxiety or any attempt to throw 
 away contraband. 
 • Direct the inmate to place their clothes next to the items previously removed from the 
 pockets. 
 Inspect any artificial limbs the inmate may be wearing by directing the inmate to remove the 
 limb and thoroughly search the limb and all attaching hardware. Dangerous weapons, drugs, 
 and money are often concealed in artificial limbs. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 21 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035901
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 If the inmate is wearing a cast, ask your supervisor for instructions. 
 As you conduct the search, look for items taped to the inmate, fresh tattoos, or needle marks. 
 If you encounter any of these situations, you should notify a supervisor upon completing the 
 search. 
 (3) Visually inspect the inmate's head: 
 • Direct the inmate to bend forward at the waist, with head tilted down, run their fingers 
 vigorously through their hair several times to dislodge any hidden contraband. 
 Note: Advise students that inmates with hair that is unable to be searched in this manner will need to be 
 inspected prior to the inmate removing their clothes. This could include dread locks or hair that is too 
 thick to effectively search. 
 • Visually inspect inside and behind both ears. Use a flashlight, if necessary. 
 • Visually inspect inside the inmate's nose. Use a flashlight, if necessary. 
 • Visually inspect inside the inmate's mouth and under the tongue. Use a flashlight, if 
 necessary. 
 • Direct the inmate to remove dentures/partial plates if applicable. 
 • If applicable, visually inspect the dentures/partial plates while the inmate holds them. 
 • Direct the inmate to pull their lower lip out and down. Next, direct the inmate to pull their 
 upper lip out and up. Be certain to inspect the inmate's gum line. 
 • If applicable, have inmate put dentures/partial plates back in mouth. 
 (4) Visually examine the inmate's front torso: 
 • Remain professional, search thoroughly, and maintain your concentration. 
 • Observe the inmate, looking for cuts, bruises, or any trauma on their body. Report any of 
 these observances to your supervisor upon completing the search. 
 • If bandages are found during the search, direct the inmate to remove them, or at least lift 
 one side to show that nothing is concealed underneath. 
 • Direct the inmate to extend their arms forward, palms down, and fingers spread. Examine 
 the back of hands and under the fingernails.

 • Direct the inmate to turn their hands over and examine the palms. 
 • Direct the inmate to raise their arms above their head, with fingers extended and spread. 
 Examine the inmate's armpits and arms. 
 • If the inmate is a female, direct her to lift her breasts so that you can see if anything is taped 
 or hidden under the breasts. 
 • If the inmate is obese, direct them to lift the folds of skin so you can see if anything is taped 
 or hidden between the folds. 
 (5) Visually examine the inmate's groin: 
 • If the inmate is a male, direct him to spread his legs and lift his genitals so that you can see 
 if anything is hidden or taped under the penis or scrotum. If the inmate is not circumcised, 
 the inmate must pull back the foreskin to expose the head of the penis. 
 • If the inmate is female, direct her to squat down, spread her vagina, and cough several 
 times to dislodge anything that may be hidden in the vaginal cavity. 
 (6) Visually examine the front of the inmate's legs and tops of the feet. 
 Slide 14 — Visual Search 
 (7) Direct the inmate to turn around and visually examine the inmate's back upper torso. 
 (8) Visually examine the back of the inmate's legs and bottom of the feet. 
 Check between the toes by directing the inmate to lift one foot at a time and wiggle the toes. 
 (9) Have the inmate face away from you and visually examine the inmate's (male and female) 
 anus by directing them to bend over and spread the buttocks. Use a flashlight, if necessary. 
 A common place for both male and female inmates to hide keys, drugs, and even hacksaw 
 blades, is inside the rectum. 
 If you suspect contraband, have the inmate squat and cough several times. 
 • If you find any evidence (a greasy substance around the rectum) that something may be 
 concealed in the anal cavity, call a supervisor immediately. 
 • Only medical personnel are permitted to conduct body cavity searches, and then only with 
 the permission of the Warden.

 (10) Search the inmate and clothing with a hand-held metal detector. 
 • Inspect the inmate's clothes by running your hands over the material, turning the garments 
 inside -out, and examining zippers, buttons, seams, cuffs, and hat bands. In addition, a 
 hand-held metal detector will be utilized when checking the inmate's clothing. 
 • Examine the soles, heels, and insides of the shoes, looking for false heels, hollow 
 compartments, or items hidden inside the shoes. In addition, a hand-held metal detector 
 will be utilized when checking the inmate's shoes. 
 (11) Examine the items that were removed from the inmate's pockets. 
 (12) Direct the inmate to retrieve their clothing and get dressed. Release the inmate to their 
 assigned duty. 
 Slide 15 - Visual Search 
 C. Documentation 
 Document the confiscated contraband using: 
 • Confiscation and Disposition of Contraband form 
 • Incident Report 
 • Memorandum 
 d. Professionalism during visual searches 
 • Respect the inmate's right to not be harassed. 
 • Be systematic by performing the visual search in the same way every time. 
 • Maintain professionalism by conducting all searches in a calm, no-nonsense manner. 
 • Remain alert at all times. Remember, keeping contraband out of the institution 
 depends on how well you do your job. Others depend on you. 
 e. Visual search scramble test 
 The visual search scramble test will check your understanding of the sequence of events 
 necessary to perform a proper visual search. Number each step in proper sequence 1 through 
 12, 1 being the first step and 12 being the last. 
 Note: Have the participants remove the Visual Search Scramble Test from their Appendix, close their manuals, 
 and put away all study aids. After all of the participants have finished taking the test, grade the tests 
 and provide feedback on their performance.

 IV. SEARCHES OF CROSS-GENDER INMATES 
 Slide 16 — Cross-Gender Searches 
 Currently, all staff may pat search inmates. Guidance for pat searches of transgender inmates is 
 provided in conjunction with the implementation of PREA standard 115.15. Pat searches 
 should be conducted in a professional and respectful manner and in the least intrusive manner 
 as possible consistent with security needs. 
 Individual transgender or intersex inmates will present different physical characteristics, which 
 may change over the course of incarceration. Staff members should be mindful of these 
 characteristics when conducting pat searches, and adjust procedures accordingly. For example, 
 if a transgendered inmate has or develops breasts, staff should use the back of the hand to 
 conduct a search of this area, as is appropriate for female inmates. 
 A transgendered inmate with breast removal would indicate the use o male pat search 
 procedures for the upper torso area. 
 A. Female Inmates 
 For a facility whose rated capacity does not exceed 50 inmates, cross-gender pat-down 
 searches of female inmates are not permitted absent exigent circumstances. Facilities shall not 
 restrict female inmates' access to regularly available programming or other out-of-cell 
 opportunities in order to comply with this provision. 
 B. Documentation of Cross-Gender Searches 
 Institutions must document all cross-gender strip searches and cross-gender visual body cavity 
 searches, and shall document all cross-gender pat-down searches of female inmates. 
 Cross -gender strip searches or cross-gender visual body cavity searches (meaning a search of 
 the anal or genital opening) are not permitted except in exigent circumstances or when 
 performed by medical practioners. 
 If there are any questions as to the appropriate search procedures for a transgendered inmate, 
 please consult supervisory staff. 
 V. REVIEW OF OBJECTIVES 
 Slide 17 — Review of Objectives 
 In review of our objectives, we have: 
 • Identified the purpose and importance of conducting searches. 
 Introduction to Correctional Techniques 25 Conducting Searches 
 Phase I Tab 22 
 EFTA00035905
April 2015 Instructor Guide 
 • Identified the general guidelines for conducting searches. 
 • Given an inmate's living area, an institution space or open area, and search equipment, 
 each participant conducted pat and area searches. 
 • Identified the proper sequence of steps used in conducting a visual search, as delineated in 
 this course of instruction. 
 VI. SUMMARY 
 Slide 18 - Summary 
 There are several reasons why searches are conducted. The most important is that searches 
 help to protect staff, inmates, and the general public. Searches help us to maintain a safer 
 working environment for all. When conducting searches, it is important to be thorough and 
 systematic in your procedures. 
 As a correctional worker, remember: 
 • Conducting searches is every correctional worker's duty and responsibility. 
 • We conduct searches to prevent escapes by controlling the introduction and conveyance of 
 contraband into the institution. 
 • Searches help ensure a safe working environment for yourself and other staff members and 
 a safe living environment for inmates. 
 Slide 19 — Thank You 
 Note: Upon completion of the summary, ensure each participant had an opportunity to participate in all three 
 performance evaluations (area search, pat search, and visual scramble test).

 FROM: 
 External Auditing Branch 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
 Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
 Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
 of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on April 22, 2024. The FBOP has 
 completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis and 
 its recommendations. 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
 particular individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, the 
 BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the field on a 
 process to ensure psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of 
 a cellmate, for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. The BOP 
 further reported that this process will include exemptions based on individual or security 
 considerations. The BOP has now indicated that this guidance has been drafted and is under review. 
 Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes 
 the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review.

FBOP's Response: The FBOP Reentry Services Division (RSD) and Correctional Programs 
 Division (CPD) have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is currently under review. 
 FBOP will provide further updates as the draft guidance is reviewed and approved as needed. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
 suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
 recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
 re -assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
 considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
 the BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the 
 fi eld on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
 individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
 psychologist. The BOP further reported that this memo will include a procedure for exemptions 
 based on individual or security considerations. The BOP has now indicated that guidance has 
 been drafted and is under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
 recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) 
 provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP's Response: RSD and CPD have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is 
 currently under review. FBOP will provide further updates as the draft guidance is reviewed and 
 approved as needed. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
 provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
 mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
 observation. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
 the BOP reported that it was evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting approval for 
 social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. The 
 BOP has now reported that while it currently does not have guidance on these issues, new 
 guidance has been drafted and is under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to 
 close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and 
 (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP's Response: RSD and CPD have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is 
 currently under review. FBOP will provide further updates as the draft guidance is reviewed and 
 approved as needed. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
 through policy, training, or other measures. 
 EFTA00035908
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
 statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
 OIG for review. 
 FBOP's Response: Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is 
 being modified to improve FBOP methods for accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. 
 Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
 conducting a round. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
 statement update referenced in its update; (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
 OIG for review; and (3) provides a description of the training referenced in its update, sample 
 training materials for OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in effect. 
 FBOP's Response: Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is 
 being modified to clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round. Because 
 revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and Union 
 negotiation process, they are subject to change. 
 However, FBOP intends for the updated policy to include clarification for Lieutenants to conduct 
 trainings sessions, via in-person required rounds and shift briefings daily. These trainings will 
 cover topics such as cell searches, minor emergency mock discussions, and other correctional 
 services training needs as assessed by local correctional services supervisors. This will allow for 
 individual assessment and training to be tailored to the needs of each individual facility while 
 also remaining in conformance with current training requirements. Training topics and formats 
 will be documented on the Daily Lieutenant Logs and reviewed by the Captain to assess and 
 implement specific local correctional training needs. Therefore, although no specific training 
 curriculum will be developed, the training requirement and supervisory review will be in effect 
 with the issuance of the updated program statement. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
 staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will continue 
 to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. At the GOP's request, 
 the OIG will not consolidate this recommendation. In addition, per the OIG's communications 
 with the BOP over email, we believe that certain information that the BOP has provided or will 
 provide to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will facilitate the 
 resolution and closure of this recommendation. Accordingly, we will consider whether to close 
 this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG all contractor and BOP work product 
 that has been submitted to the GAO in response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations, 
 including the August 2022 assessment by the contractor on staffing incentives and the 
 EFTA00035909
information BOP submitted to GAO in March 2023 related to the assessment; (2) provides the 
 OIG an update on the contractor's or BOP's analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, 
 whether submitted yet to GAO or not; (3) provides the OIG any reports submitted to 
 Congressional appropriation committees related to staffing; (4) implements the staffing tool for 
 all BOP professions; and (5) provides an analysis of whether the new incentives mentioned in its 
 update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage, and what additional proposals, 
 including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, are being considered 
 by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage. 
 FBOP's Response: FBOP appreciates OIG's determination to not consolidate the analysis of 
 this recommendation with that of Recommendation 5 from the OIG's Limited-Scope Review of 
 the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Strategies to Identify, Communicate, and Remedy Operational 
 Issues, Report Number 23-065 (Limited-Scope Review), at FBOP's request. OIG indicates that it 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after FBOP does the following: 
 (1) OIG requests all contractor and FBOP work product that has been submitted to the GAO in 
 response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations, including the August 2022 assessment by 
 the contractor on staffing incentives and the information FBOP submitted to GAO in March 
 2023 related to the assessment. 
 FBOP now provides the requested information. Please see the following attachments: 
 "Attachment I Staffing_GAO 21-123," "Attachment 2 Staffing_GAO 21-123," "BOP Staffing 
 Current State Assessment FINAL," "FINAL Incentives Playbook_All Resources_June 13," 
 "Fully executed contract 2_Redacted," "Interviews and Survey Results," "NTT DATA Response 
 to BOP Staffing Risk Management 04062021 Final," "SOW-BOP Staffing Risk 
 Management_l," and "STATEMENT OF WORK." 
 (2) OIG requests that FBOP provide an update on the contractor's or FBOP's analysis of staffing 
 incentives since March 2023, whether submitted yet to GAO or not; 
 The FBOP is currently analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of both recruitment and 
 retention incentives. This analysis is ongoing. Therefore, FBOP will provide its analysis to OIG 
 when completed. 
 (3) OIG requests any reports submitted to Congressional appropriation committees related to 
 staffing. See the following attachments: "FY23 BOP Vacancies at Facilities CRPT Package," 
 "FY 2023 BOP CRPT Vacancies at BOP Facilities — Attachment," and "FY 2023 CRPT BOP 
 FSA Implementation Q2 Hill Letters Package - WF220990." 
 (4) OIG requests that FBOP implements the staffing tool for all BOP professions. 
 Currently, the Automated Staffing Tool is a workforce planning tool that remains in development 
 and testing. Position recommendations for the following departments have been completed and 
 remain in ongoing testing and feedback stages: Correctional Services, Correctional Systems, 
 Chaplaincy Services, Education, Food Service, Health Services, ITDD, Recreation, Safety, and 
 Unit Management. 
 EFTA00035910
All other disciplines are tentatively scheduled to be completed by October 2024. It is anticipated 
 that the workforce planning tool will be fully utilized beginning in October 2024. 
 (5) OIG requests FBOP to provide an analysis of whether the new incentives mentioned in its 
 previous status update have made an impact on the staffing shortage, and what additional 
 proposals, including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, are being 
 considered by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage. 
 Additional time will be required to determine the effect of those incentives implemented during 
 the current fiscal year. However, it should be noted the FBOP was approved for nation-wide 
 direct -hire authority by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on May 13, 2024. This will 
 assist the FBOP in filling vacancies in the future. FBOP is working with the Department of 
 Justice on a nationwide special salary rate request for our institution positions. 
 Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
 as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is partially responsive to the recommendation. The update for 
 Recommendation 5 is related to Lieutenant Rounds and not cell searches. The update does not 
 indicate that the BOP has or will evaluate its cell search procedures and make any necessary 
 changes to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. The update 
 only addresses the logging of cell searches within TRUSCOPE rather than evaluating its cell 
 search procedures. The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP 
 (1) completes the evaluation of using TRUSCOPE to log cell searches; (2) otherwise evaluates 
 its cell search procedures and makes any appropriate changes to improve those procedures; and 
 (3) provides a description of the training referenced in its response, sample training materials for 
 OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in effect. 
 FBOP's Response: FBOP's Correctional Programs Division has evaluated current policy and 
 training as related to cell searches. FBOP has concluded that cell search requirements, including 
 appropriate documentation requirements via TRUSCOPE, are clearly outlined in two separate 
 current policies: Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional Services Manual, and Program 
 Statement 5521.06, issued January 2, 2018; and the Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and 
 Inmate Work Areas, issued on June 4, 2015. 
 In addition to the general requirements for conducting cell searches contained in the above 
 program statements, an institutional supplement is required for Security Inspections at each 
 institution detailing specific local procedures. Locally, specific post orders are developed which 
 include search requirements and documentation requirements. Current policy and training are 
 adequate to convey the specific requirements for conducting cell searches. 
 Further review indicates that specific training exists for conducting cell searches and is included 
 in the below training curriculums. Initially, all staff receive specific training on cell searches 
 during Introduction to Correctional Techniques, Phase I. Additionally, in January 2020, Back to 
 Basics training was implemented as mandatory training for all institution employees. Back to 
 Basics is an annual in-person training which includes a set curriculum with practical exercises. 
 The sections listed below specifically include cell searches and practical exercises. 
 EFTA00035911
• (Initial) Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT) Phase I, Tab 22: Conducting 
 Searches. See attachment "ICTPhaseI-Tab 22-IG." 
 • (Annual) Back 2 Basics Managing Housing Units Part I - Conduct searches of the 
 housing unit to include cell searches. See attachment "7-B2B-Managing Housing Units 
 Part I-Lesson Plan-FY2024." 
 • (Annual) Back 2 Basics Managing Housing Units Part 2 - Conduct searches of the 
 housing unit to include cell searches (Practical Exercise). See attachment "8-B2B-
 Managing Housing Units Part II-Lesson Plan-FY2024." 
 Therefore, because FBOP has demonstrated completion of its evaluation of using TRUSCOPE to 
 log cell searches and its evaluation of cell search procedures, and has provided a description of 
 training referenced, including confirmation that the training is currently in effect, FBOP now 
 respectfully requests closure of this recommendation. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
 functionality checks. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the O1O for review. 
 FBOP's Response: FBOP is currently in the process of making modifications to Program 
 Statement 4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual; and Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional 
 Services Manual, to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various aspects of the 
 FBOP's camera systems including but not necessarily limited to functionality, documentation, 
 and repair. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP 
 development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide 
 further updates pertaining to these revisions as they become available. 
 To ensure immediate action, a joint memorandum (from FBOP's Administration Division and 
 Correctional Programs Division) was sent to all CEOs addressing the Security Camera Monthly 
 Report. The new report is now in use and became effective June 1, 2024. See attachments 
 "Camera Report Implementation signed" and "Security Camera Report Template."

MEMORANDUM FOR MICHAEL E. HOROWITZ, INSPECTOR GENERAL, 
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
 FROM: Warden (Retired) 
 SUBJECT: Response to Draft for the Office of Inspector General 
 Investigation (OIG) of Jeffrey Epstein Suicide 
 On Wednesday April 5, 2023, I reviewed the OIG draft report for 
 the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional 
 Center (MCC) in New York, New York. The draft stated that I 
 used poor judgement in not selecting a backup cellmate for 
 Jeffrey Epstein while he was housed in the Special Housing Unit 
 (SHU) . 
 MCC New York is a pre-trial institution. The majority of the 
 inmates housed at the facility are not designated and the 
 facility had one designated unit that housed approximately 
 seventy inmates. Pre-trial and designated inmates cannot be 
 housed together. Mr. Epstein was housed in the SHU. The SHUs 
 are housing units in Bureau institutions where inmates are 
 securely separated from general inmate population, and may be 
 housed either alone or with other inmates. Special Housing 
 Units help ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of 
 correctional facilities, and protect the public, by providing 
 alternative housing assignments for inmates removed from general 
 population. 
 Prior to placing Mr. Epstein in the SHU, we vetted several 
 inmates as potential cellmates for him. There was only one 
 inmate that was identified as an appropriate cellmate. The 
 inmates in SHU were constantly being moved to other units, being 
 transferred, or released on a daily basis. We were constantly 
 monitoring the inmate population in SHU for Mr. Epstein's safety 
 and potential cell mates. Based on the mission of the 
 institution, the constant movement of inmates out of SHU, along 
 with the number of inmates that posed a threat to his safety, 
 there were no potential backup inmates to be housed with Mr. 
 Epstein during the period he was housed in the SHU. 
 Thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing my 
 response. 
 Respectfully submitted,

 MEMORANDUM FOR 
 ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
 FROM: ief 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
 Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
 Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
 of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on August 28, 2024. The FBOP 
 has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis 
 and its recommendations. 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
 the particular individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, the 
 BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the field on a 
 process to ensure psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of 
 a cellmate, for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. The BOP 
 further reported that this process will include exemptions based on individual or security 
 considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that this guidance had been drafted and 
 was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the 
 OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance 
 referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
 EFTA00035919
FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
 development. FBOP has determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program 
 Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a 
 guidance memorandum. FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process 
 already established for single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but 
 apply it to general population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program 
 Review policy will prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if 
 single -cell placement in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language 
 pertaining to the process in the policy for SHU. 
 The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will explain that, 
 if it appears necessary to single cell an individual in a general population unit during regular 
 working hours, the Unit Manager will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) 
 for their recommendations. If a single cell is required after hours or on weekends, the Operations 
 Lieutenant will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) telephonically for their 
 recommendations. Monitoring single-ceiling in the general population will be recorded on 
 "BP -A1121 CO Single Cell Review Form-GP" (see attachment). This form will be signed by the 
 Warden as soon as feasible following the placement of an individual in a single cell. These forms 
 will be reviewed and discussed during the weekly multidisciplinary team meetings and the 
 recommendations (to continue or discontinue) will be recorded by the Unit Manager in 
 TRUSCOPE, as a "daily log entry." 
 Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
 become available. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
 risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
 until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
 plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
 individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
 the BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the 
 field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
 individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
 psychologist. The BOP further reported that this memo will include a procedure for exemptions 
 based on individual or security considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that 
 this guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance 
 is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (I) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized 
 guidance to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
 development. Further, as stated in the response to Recommendation I, above, FBOP has 
 EFTA00035920
determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program Statement 5321.09, Unit 
 Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a guidance memorandum. 
 FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process already established for 
 single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but apply it to general 
 population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will 
 prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if single-cell placement 
 in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language pertaining to the process in the 
 policy for SHU. 
 Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
 become available. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
 and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
 process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
 the BOP reported that it was evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting approval for 
 social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. In a 
 February 2024 update, the BOP reported that while it currently does not have guidance on these 
 issues, new guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the 
 guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
 recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) 
 provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in its previous status update, FBOP was developing guidance 
 with regard to its process for obtaining and documenting approval for social and/or legal visits 
 while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. However, upon further 
 consideration, FBOP has determined that this guidance should not be in the form of a guidance 
 memorandum, but should instead be included in Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention 
 Policy. Therefore, FBOP is in the process of altering that policy accordingly. Because revisions 
 to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and Union negotiation 
 process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they become available. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
 methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
 EFTA00035921
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
 OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
 for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
 the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
 provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant N1 lien 
 conducting a round. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP reported that 
 it is updating its policy to address the recommendation. In its February 2024 update, the BOP 
 also indicated that it would be conducting training for Lieutenants on conducting rounds. The 
 OIG therefore previously asked the BOP to provide "a description of the training referenced in 
 its update, sample training materials for OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in 
 effect." The BOP has indicated that, to allow for variation based on the specific needs of each 
 institution, there will not be a specific BOP-wide curriculum for the training; however, training 
 will be conducted and documented on the Daily Lieutenant Logs and reviewed by the Captain 
 for specific local training needs. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
 recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program statement update referenced in its 
 update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
 for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
 the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
 provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
 address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will continue 
 to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. Accordingly, we will 
 consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG an update on 
 the contractor's or GOP's analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, whether submitted 
 yet to GAO or not; (2) implements the staffing tool for all BOP professions; (3) provides an 
 analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire authority mentioned in its 
 update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage; (4) provides an update on its efforts 
 to establish a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions; and (5) describes any 
 additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, 
 that are being considered by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage and provides an 
 EFTA00035922
update to the OIG on the Department's consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such 
 proposal. 
 FBOP Response: OIG indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
 FBOP: 
 1. Provides an update on the contractor's or FBOP's analysis of staffing incentives 
 since March 2023; whether submitted yet to GAO or not. 
 The FBOP is currently analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of both recruitment and 
 retention incentives. This analysis is ongoing. Therefore, FBOP will provide an update to OIG 
 when completed. 
 2. Implements the staffing tool for all FBOP professions. 
 The Automated Staffing Tool (AST) went live officially on October I, 2024, and has been 
 implemented for all FBOP professions. This workforce planning tool will allow FBOP 
 leadership to identify true institution position needs to safely and effectively operate all of the 
 FBOP's 122 institutions. The AST recommends position numbers based on data driven insights 
 from internal and external subject matter experts, institution-specific criteria, and evolving 
 mission requirements. 
 3. Provides an analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire 
 authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing 
 shortage. 
 The FBOP continues to collect data in an effort to complete its analysis in 2025. However, 
 preliminary analysis has shown retention incentives to be an effective factor when comparing 
 data from the recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, the lowest number of total separations occurred 
 with 2,572 separations. In FY 2023, the FBOP had 2,900 separations. FY 2022 had the highest 
 number of separations in the FBOP in recent years with 3,665. 
 Recruitment measures have also made an impact in the most recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, 
 FBOP saw the largest influx of staff since FY 2021, with 3,596 new hires. Comparatively, 
 FY 2023 saw 2,622 new hires and 1,846 in FY 2022. After receiving nationwide DHA approval 
 in May 2024, and continuing through September 2024, the FBOP has hired over 450 correctional 
 officers with Direct Hiring Authority, totaling 642 for FY 2024. This is significantly greater than 
 our total of 196 new hires for FY 2023 and 83 new hires for FY 2022 without nationwide DHA. 
 4. Provides an update on its efforts to establish a nationwide special salary rate for 
 institution positions. 
 The FBOP is continuing to actively collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a special salary rate aimed at addressing 
 recruitment and retention challenges within our institutions by offering more competitive 
 salaries. Currently, the FBOP is focusing Special Salary Rate efforts on the Correctional Officer 
 EFTA00035923
and nurse positions and submitted its request to DOJ at the end of September 2024. DOJ 
 informed FBOP that both requests are under OPM review. 
 5. Describes any additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address 
 pay rates in certain localities, that are being considered by the BOP to fully address 
 the staffing shortage and provides an update to the OIG on the Department's 
 consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such proposal. 
 As of November 2024, FBOP has no further input regarding proposals being considered to 
 address the staffing shortage. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
 system functionality checks. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
 will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, and Program Statement 4200.12, Facilities Operations 
 Manual, are being modified to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various 
 aspects of FBOP's camera systems, including but not limited to functionality, documentation, 
 and repair. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal development and 
 Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates as they 
 become available. 
 However, to ensure immediate action, a joint memorandum from FBOP's Administration 
 Division and Correctional Programs Division was sent to all CEOs addressing necessary camera 
 protocols. See attachments "Camera Report Implementation signed" and "Security Camera 
 Report Template." The joint memorandum implemented a monthly reporting process in all 
 facilities and attached a template to use for monthly reporting. The monthly reporting requires 
 electronic technicians at each facility to list the number of installed cameras, adjustments to the 
 camera count as needed, information regarding camera recording capability and camera 
 operational state, and information regarding any repairs made to the cameras during the month of 
 reporting. The Captain and Facility Manager must review each monthly report from the facility 
 and ensure accuracy. The monthly Security Camera Report will then be included in the Facilities 
 Management Monthly Report to Regional offices and submitted from the Warden to the 
 Regional Director. The new monthly Security Camera Report is now in use and became effective 
 June 1, 2024.

 ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
 June 16, 2023 
 SUBJECT: Response to the Ofti of Inspector Gen OIG) Draft Report: 
 Investigation and R ew of the Federal Bureau o sons' Custody, Care, 
 and Supervision of E ein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
 in New York, New Yo 
 The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the 
 Inspector General's above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the facts and 
 circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and will utilize this report to apply lessons 
 learned where applicable to the broader BOP correctional landsrapP. Under its current leadership, BOP 
 is committed to improving the agency's ability to meet its mission. In fact, in April of this year. BOP 
 announced its new mission as "corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment 
 and ensure public safety by preparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities." BOP 
 must treat the adults in its custody with dignity and respect and ensure they receive necessary medical 
 and mental health care on an individualized basis, content with sound correctional judgment. 
 However, certain recommendations from this report appear to reflect an assumption that because a 
 limited number of employees at MCC New York failed to adhere to BOP policies and practices. those 
 policies and practices must themselves be flawed. As an agency with more than 35,000 employees 
 across more than 120 facilities, BOP believes that employees who fail to adhere to the law, regulations, 
 and BOP's own policies must be held accountable. However, the vast majority of BOP's employees 
 work tirelessly under challenging conditions. We must be careful not to ascribe the facts specific to the 
 Jeffrey Epstein incident at MCC New York to BOP's entire workforce. Using the Jeffrey Epstein 
 incident as a basis for overhauling national policies and practices without evaluating whether similar 
 trends exist at other locations or considering the role of employee accountability and training could be 
 detrimental to sound correctional practices. 
 BOP previously provided OIG its technical assessment of these recommendations in an effort to 
 resolve potential concerns prior to the publication of this report. BOP appreciates OIG's review of this

 New York, New York

 information and looks forward to working with OIG to address any remaining unresolved issues in the 
 immediate future. BOP's specific comments regarding OIG's recommendations are as follows: 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation. 
 BOP's Response: Although BOP cannot concur with this recommendation based on its current 
 wording, BOP agrees to implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch or 
 psychological observation whenever appropriate for the individual and when security concerns 
 allow. 
 BOP's current process, updated in the years following Jeffrey Epstein's death, already takes an 
 individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody in the context of suicide 
 watch and psychological observation. Upon removal from suicide watch or psychological 
 observation, psychologists make individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up 
 and other custodial concerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit 
 team staff work collaboratively to ensure each individual removed from suicide watch has a 
 cellmate whenever clinically and correctionally appropriate. In the event an individual is 
 determined to have moderate to high baseline risk for suicide and no suitable cellmate can be 
 identified, continued placement on suicide watch is to be considered. BOP provides guidance 
 through national trainings each fiscal year for its psychologists about individualized care 
 recommendations. 
 It is not sound correctional practice to apply a one size fits all approach regardless of a person's 
 individual needs and without factoring the safety of others or the security concerns of the 
 institution. For example, some persons may be extremely violent or pose a risk to other adults in 
 custody at the conclusion of suicide watch. Additionally, some of these persons may require 
 protective custody from others and placing them with a cellmate may create additional risk to 
 their safety. An adult in custody's status post suicide watch or psychological observation cannot 
 be the sole factor considered in cellmate placement; sound correctional judgement must be 
 utilized and is vital to the safe and orderly operations of BOP's institutions. Therefore, at times, 
 single ceiling may be the only sound correctional decision for an individual who has been 
 removed from suicide watch or psychological observation. However, single-ceiling is routinely 
 monitored by each region in the BOP. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
 suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cell mate until the 
 recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
 re -assignment, ensuring that another cellmate can be assigned efficiently. 
 BOP's Response: BOP concurs with this recommendation insofar as BOP agrees to establish 
 procedures to ensure adults in custody at high risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is 
 appropriate and recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the recommendation is 
 changed or rescinded. 
 EFTA00035926
OIG Official Draft Report: BOP's Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC 
 New York, New York 
 June 15, 2023 
 Page 3 of 6 
 BOP's current process already takes an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults 
 in custody in the context of suicide watch and psychological observation. Upon removal from 
 suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care recommendations are made by 
 psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP already makes each ceiling 
 assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at moderate to high risk for suicide. 
 These considerations include both mental health and custodial concerns. Psychology Services, 
 Correctional Services, and Unit Team work closely to monitor individuals identified to be at risk 
 for suicide to determine placement considerations. BOP uses the Psychology Advisory List 
 (PAL) and PSY ALERT status to monitor those individuals whom employees should have 
 heightened awareness. These codes ensure employees are better able to monitor individuals at 
 risk for suicide to ensure they have an appropriate cellmate. 
 Regarding contingency planning, BOP has serious concerns about "contingency-planning" for 
 cellmates for adults in custody at high risk for suicide. The process of assessing this procedure 
 is impossible given the number of individuals determined high risk, the frequency of movement, 
 and the complexity of security concerns. Movement is frequent among BOP's mainline facilities 
 and even more so at pre-trial facilities. It is not feasible to maintain accurate, individualized 
 contingency plans listing several back-up individuals for each high-risk individual in its custody. 
 Identifying appropriate cellmates is best done in real time with the most current information, 
 resulting in the safest outcomes. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should implement a process that requires approval to be 
 obtained and documented for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation. 
 BOP's Response: Although BOP cannot concur with this recommendation based on its current 
 wording, BOP agrees to evaluate its processes and train its employees to ensure approval is 
 obtained and documented for social or legal visits while an adult in custody is on suicide watch 
 or psychological observation. Pre-trial institutions such as MCC New York have supplemental 
 policy to address legal visits for persons on suicide watch. MCC New York had an appropriate 
 institutional supplement to address this issue but did not adhere to that policy. As noted above, 
 BOP will evaluate Program Statement 5324.08 and other relevant program statements to 
 determine an effective method for integrating information from the local Suicide Prevention 
 Coordinator regarding individuals' current stressors and protective factors into the Warden's 
 decision -making process. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should improve its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing by expanding institutional controls, training, and documentation. 
 BOP's Response: Although BOP cannot concur with this recommendation based on its current 
 wording, BOP agrees to improve its methods for holding employees accountable for failing to 
 account for adult in custody whereabouts and wellbeing as required through established 
 institutional controls and documentation. BOP respectfully asserts that its current

 policies already require personnel to account for adult in custody whereabouts and wellbeing. 
 Program Statement 5500.14 outlines basic principles of accountability, such as count procedures, 
 census checks, control center records, daily change/transfer sheet, adult in custody callouts. 
 Policy also mandates institutions to develop a supplement which outlines adult in custody 
 accountability, specifically census checks. 
 The OIG report's findings indicate a lack of employee accountability at MCC New York during 
 the period when this incident occurred. BOP acknowledges the lack of accountability at MCC 
 New York and is committed to ensuring its employees are appropriately trained and held 
 accountable. This includes employees being held accountable for the completion of job duties 
 involving controlling and documenting adult in custody movement, observation, and related 
 activities. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when 
 conducting a round. 
 BOP's Response: BOP concurs with this recommendation and intends to clarify what is required 
 of a lieutenant when conducting a round. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should develop and implement a plan to address staffing 
 shortages at its prisons. 
 BOP's Response: BOP agrees that hiring and retaining qualified personnel is a key priority. 
 BOP has already developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach that involves enhanced 
 recruitment efforts and appropriate incentives. However, the scope of OIG's work in this 
 product was limited to the investigation and review of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at MCC New 
 York and OIG did not request or give the BOP an opportunity to address the significant work 
 that has already been undertaken regarding staffing. 
 Further, we disagree with the inference in this recommendation that a staffing shortage 
 compounded the issues in this incident. While we recognize the statement by one employee that 
 rounds were not conducted because they were tired, the incident did not result from lack of 
 staffing. The Special Housing Unit was fully staffed on all three shifts prior to Jeffrey Epstein's 
 suicide, with employees who chose not to conduct rounds.' OIG's position that employees failed 
 to attend to their duties as a result of staffing challenges is tenuous and alleviates the 
 responsibility of employees to perform duties during their scheduled shifts. This responsibility is 
 carried out by the vast majority of BOP's employees every day and ensures the safety and 
 security of those in our care and custody. The negligence of specific employees at MCC New 
 York in their duties should not be excused by reinforcing BOP's staffing challenges as the basis 
 for misconduct. 
 I 010 notes that these employees worked a 24-hour shift. Although these employees volunteered to work beyond 16 
 hours, BOP is examining options to ensure employees no longer work a consecutive 24-hour shift absent an 
 institution emergency.

 New York, New York 
 June 15, 2023 
 Page 5 of 6 
 Recommendation Seven: The BOP should clarify and improve the cell search policy. 
 BOP's Response: BOP does not agree with this recommendation. BOP has established policy, 
 Program Statement 5521.06, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas, and 
 Program Statement 5580.08, Inmate Personal Property, that outlines what an adult in custody is 
 allowed to have in their possession and defines contraband, to include procedures for handling it. 
 Program Statement 5270.11, Special Housing Units, outlines conditions of confinement, as well 
 as personal property allowed, within the Special Housing Unit. Controlling excessive property 
 and specifically linens is an employee performance and conduct issue rather than a policy issue. 
 It is not realistic or sound correctional practice for BOP's policy to specifically list each piece of 
 property an adult in custody may possess and the appropriate quantity for those items. 
 Additionally, institutions are required to supplement BOP cell search policy on a localized basis. 
 To insist upon an across-the-board national cell search requirement detailing specific item 
 restrictions fails to account for the wide variety of needs and diverse population of adults in 
 custody throughout BOP's many facilities. We do, however, believe that employees should be 
 held accountable when not following our policies. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
 functionality checks. 
 BOP's Response: BOP concurs with this recommendation and agrees to enhance policies that 
 already exist to ensure institutional security camera systems have capacity to record video and 
 are regularly checked for functionality. BOP notes that policies already exist concerning 
 institutional security camera systems. Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional Services 
 Manual, requires an Institutional Supplement for Security Inspections/Searches, and specifically 
 states, "The Warden is to establish, by Institution Supplement, a security inspection system that 
 involves all departments. The Institution Supplement will include posts and areas required to 
 submit inspection forms, frequency of submission, guidelines for checking security features, and 
 reporting of weaknesses and inconsistencies." 
 Additional Concerns: While the above is our formal response to the recommendations, BOP 
 would also like to note our continued strong objections to some of the technical 
 language/inconsistencies/security concerns still included in the version of the report provided to 
 us on June 15th, 2023. 
 Specifically, BOP was unaware of any changes to Mr. Epstein's last will and testament prior to 
 his death, yet it is consistently mentioned in the report, leading the reader to conclude 
 differently (i.e., that BOP was aware prior to his death). Additionally, the report indicates that 
 there were delays in completing the camera upgrade/repair; however, BOP would like to note 
 that the upgrade/repair had been requested. Also, the BOP adamantly objects to the use of the 
 EFTA00035929
OIG Official Draft Report: BOP's Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC 
 New York, New York

 term "widespread" in relation to the failure of employees to follow policy. Finally, our concerns

 MEMORANDUM FOR 
 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR 
 HOMELAND SECURITY AND JUSTICE 
 FROM: SUPERVISORY ATTORNEY 
 EXTERNAL AUDITING BRANCH 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
 Report Bureau of Prisons: Opportunities Exist to Better Analyze Staffing 
 Data and Improve Employee Wellness Programs, Report Number GAO-21 
 123 
 The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a formal response to the 
 Government Accountability Office's (GAO) regarding the report entitled, Report Bureau of Prisons: 
 Opportunities Exist to Better Analyze Staffing Data and Improve Employee Wellness Programs 
 (GAO -21-123). The BOP has completed our review, and we offer the following status update 
 regarding the report and its recommendations. 
 Priority Recommendation One: The Director of BOP should develop and implement a reliable 
 method, or amend existing methods, for calculating staffing levels at BOP institutions. 
 GAO Analysis Regarding Priority Recommendation One: BOP concurred with this 
 recommendation and has begun taking steps to address it. In June 2021, BOP reported that it 
 hired a contractor to assist the agency in calculating staffing levels at BOP institutions and, in 
 August 2022, BOP reported that the contractor had completed its assessment and developed a 
 new automated staffing tool prototype. BOP reported that the intent of the new tool is to address 
 BOP staffing challenges by providing an updated, standardized, and transparent view of staffing 
 guidelines, and also for assessing staffing levels. BOP also reported in August 2022 that the 
 contractor was testing the new tool prototype, primarily focusing on correctional services 
 positions, in one of BOP's regions before expanding it to additional regions. In March 2023, 
 EFTA00035931
BOP reported that the contractor was testing a prototype of the tool in three of BOP's six regions, 
 primarily focusing on positions in the correctional services discipline. BOP anticipated that the 
 tool would be rolled out to all six BOP regional offices by June 2023, followed by positions from 
 additional BOP disciplines. In March 2024, BOP reported that the tool will be fully implemented 
 by October 2024, covering all regions and all position disciplines. We will continue to monitor 
 BOP's progress toward addressing this recommendation by assessing (1) the extent to which the 
 tool's test shows that it can effectively calculate staffing levels based on its expanded usage in 
 more regions and all position disciplines, and (2) the implementation of the tool for all positions, 
 so that BOP can address total staffing needs. 
 FBOP's Response: The AST uses a consistent approach to calculate the number of needed 
 positions across all disciplines in the institutions. The calculation starts with forming guidelines 
 for baseline positions and then incorporates additional criteria to determine the total number of 
 recommended positions for each institution. Baseline positions are calculated by developing 
 updated guidelines with FBOP SMEs and are validated with leadership and external 
 benchmarking conversations. The AST then uses broad and discipline-specific criteria derived 
 from multiple working sessions with FBOP SMEs to account for specific needs and 
 considerations of institutions. Only institutions that meet the relevant criteria for the given 
 discipline will receive position adjustments. Criteria adjustments are added along with baseline 
 positions to determine the true total number of positions needed at an institution. Currently, the 
 tool provides recommendations for all institutional level positions regardless of funding source 
 (e.g., FSA, PHS, contracted, etc.). The AST only calculates institution positions by department, 
 with the exception of institution Executive staff (i.e., Wardens, Associate Wardens, etc.). 
 Therefore, because the FBOP has developed and implemented a reliable method for calculating 
 staffing levels at FBOP institutions, the FBOP respectfully requests closure of this 
 recommendation. 
 Recommendation Two: The Director of BOP should develop and implement a plan for 
 analyzing data to help identify and address the causes and potential impacts of staffing 
 challenges on staff and inmates. 
 GAO Analysis Regarding Recommendation Two: BOP concurred with this recommendation 
 and has begun taking early steps to address it. In June 2021, BOP reported that it hired a 
 contractor to assist the agency over several months in analyzing data to identify and address 
 impacts of staffing challenges. In March 2023, BOP reported that the contractor had conducted 
 research, including interviews with BOP leaders and focus groups across BOP, discussing topics 
 such as staffing, recruiting, and retention. BOP reported that the contractor conducted additional 
 interviews with 50 BOP employees to gain additional understanding related to employee 
 retention. BOP reported that the research resulted in an assessment. In March 2024, BOP 
 officials told us that the assessment was illustrative for determining trends related to what 
 contributes to employee retention. However, BOP officials told us that limited data is available 
 to determine additional impacts, such as the effects of staffing challenges on inmate 
 programming, for example. We will continue to monitor BOP's progress toward addressing this 
 recommendation. 
 EFTA00035932
FBOP's Response: The FBOP has asked the contractor to conduct further analysis in this area. 
 We expect to receive an updated analysis on the impact of staffing on inmate programming by 
 May 2025. 
 Priority Recommendation Three: The Director of BOP should conduct a risk assessment of its 
 overtime and augmentation use, including identifying risks to staff, inmates, and institution 
 security; and determining actions to respond, as appropriate. 
 GAO Analysis Regarding Priority Recommendation Three: BOP concurred with this 
 recommendation and has taken steps to address it. In June 2021, BOP reported that it hired a 
 contractor to assist the agency in assessing the risk of overtime and augmentation usage and 
 develop an overtime calculation tool. In August 2022, the contractor finalized its risk assessment 
 of overtime and augmentation use. The study concluded that there were few risks of overtime 
 and augmentation, for example, related to sick leave, vacancies, or inmate and staff incidents. 
 However, the study was based on limited data, and, in March 2024, BOP officials acknowledged 
 that there are likely additional risks to overtime and augmentation than what was found in 
 the contractor's report, but they do not have plans to pursue an additional study on the risks. 
 Related to the same August 2022 contractor study, BOP reported that the contractor created a 
 tool to retroactively track overtime spending. In March 2023, BOP reported that the contractor 
 had finished the analysis, and that BOP had been tracking overtime and augmentation usage and 
 trends for several months. In March 2024, BOP reported that it has continued to track overtime 
 and augmentation usage monthly and acknowledged that BOP needs to reduce its reliance on 
 overtime and augmentation. Continued tracking will illuminate drivers and trends of overtime 
 and augmentation usage and help BOP invest in short and longer-time solutions to mitigate 
 associated risks. We will continue to monitor GOP's progress in addressing our recommendation. 
 FBOP's Response: The FBOP continues to track overtime and augmentation at a minimum of 
 twice monthly. The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the FBOP. 
 When an insufficient number of Correctional Officers are available to cover mission critical 
 correctional posts, which can occur for several reasons including staff absences, population 
 increases, or other reasons, the FBOP may assign non-custody staff as officers to reduce the need 
 to vacate posts deemed critical for the safety and security of the institution. 
 Priority Recommendation Four: The Director of BOP should assess the outcomes of the 
 staffing incentives it utilizes by developing performance measures and goals, measuring 
 outcomes against them, and adjusting incentives, as appropriate. 
 GAO Analysis Regarding Priority Recommendation Four: BOP concurred with this 
 recommendation and reported in February 2022 that its contractor was finalizing a risk analysis 
 of the agency's current use of staffing incentives. In August 2022, the contractor finalized its 
 analysis of staffing incentives. In March 2023, BOP stated that, based on the assessment, the 
 contractor continued its work to standardize incentive usage, including working with BOP 
 Executive Staff and other Human Resources staff to identify performance measures and goals for 
 its use of incentives. In June 2023, BOP released its Incentives Playbook, with the intended 
 purpose of standardizing BOP's approach to staffing incentives. The Incentives Playbook also 
 includes performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the incentives. In March 2024, 
 EFTA00035933
BOP reported that it will have sufficient data to be able to measure the outcomes of performance 
 metrics in 2025. This ongoing work should help BOP determine the effectiveness of staffing 
 incentives. 
 FBOP's Response: The Incentive playbook identified four performance goals to evaluate the 
 effectiveness of the BOP utilization of retention incentives. Although not a true calculation of the 
 retention rate, the below data supports the overall rationale that when compared to historical data 
 (previous 5 years), the FBOP has reduced separations and therefore retained more staff. Further 
 analysis is being conducted to more clearly associate the nexus of retention incentive utilization 
 against retention rates against the below performance metrics. 
 a) Increase overall employee retention by 5% compared to historical retention rate. 
 The overall turnover rate in CY24 was 8.3%. Based on historical data of 8.5%, the FBOP 
 turnover rate decreased by 2.4%. 
 b) Increase Correctional Officer retention by 10% compared to historical retention 
 rate. 
 The turnover rate for CO in CY24 was 8.5%. Based on historical data of 8.6%, the FBOP 
 turnover rate decreased 1.2%. 
 c) Increase New Hire retention by 10% compared to historical retention rate. 
 The turnover rate for new hires in CY24 was 16.7%. Based on the historical data of 
 19.1%, the turnover rate decreased by 12.6% 
 d) Increase Nurse retention by 10% compared to historical retention rate. 
 The turnover rate for CO in CY24 was 11.7%. Based on historical data of 12.9%, the 
 FBOP turnover rate decreased by 9.3%.

 The Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not attended SHU training, but he 
 had worked in the SHU approximately 10 to 20 times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he 
 reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and then worked his regular 8:00 a.m. 
 to 4:00 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations 
 Lieutenant called and asked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The 
 Material Handler said he worked the 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge and Noel. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, 
 which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from 12:00 a.m. on August 9 through 12:00 a.m. on August 
 10. After the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge left at 10:00 p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were 
 the only employees working in the SHU from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that 
 Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting with his attorneys at approximately 8:00 p.m., which was later 
 than the rest of the inmates, and was returned to his cell on L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel 
 gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said they left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein 
 was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that Epstein needed a cellmate.

 2. The 10:00 p.m. SHU Count on August 9 
 At the time of the 10:00 p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in 
 their cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for 
 conducting the 10:00 p.m. stand up count. At 10:00 p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were 
  nd the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness 
 statements, and BOP records, the  OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the 10:00 p.m. 
 count in the SHU.34 Nonetheless   .nd the Material Handler completed and signed the 10:00 p.m. SHU 
 count slip. The 10:00 p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as "73 + 1." According to the 
 MCC New York master count sheet for the 10:00 p.m. count on August 9, 2019, all units had verbally 
 reported their inmate counts to the Control Center by 10:30 p.m.3s At approximately 10:36 p.m., the Control 
 Center completed all paperwork and officially cleared the 10:00 p.m. institutional count. 
 The Material Handler said he was present at the time of the 10:00 p.m. count, but that the count was not 
 conducted because everyone was tired. The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an 
 overtime shift from 12:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m., his regular shift from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., followed by his 
 SHU overtime shift from 4:00 p.m. to midnight. Thus, at the time of the 10:00 p.m. count, he had worked 22 
 consecutive hours at MCC New York. The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the 10:00 p.m. 
 count slip, and believed that Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers. He did not know why 
 the count slip listed "73 + 1". 
 34 The quality of the SHU video footage was poor. Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the 0IG analyzed 
 witness statements and BOP records to better determine what the video depicted. 
 33 The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is "Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet?

  The Material Handler said he believed the 
 rounds listed on the round sheet as having occurred between 
 4:01 p.m. to 7:36 p.m. probably had been done, but he was 
 uncertain about the remaining rounds. The Material Handler 
 said he had seen officers "blow off' 30-minute rounds in the 
 past.'

 1. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU 
 Federal regulations require that employees "use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties."65
 Additionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees "[c]onduct themselves in a manner that 
 fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government."66 Because 
 "(i]nattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents," BOP 
 standards of conduct also require employees "to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours." BOP 
 policy also requires "fc]ontinuous inmate accountability," which is accomplished through rounds and inmate 
 counts. 67 Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and ensure that 
 they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health. 
 BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability 
 measures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice 
 each hour, no more than 40 minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify 
 that at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 
 5:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. daily, and also at 10:00 a.m. on weekends and federal holidays. 
 The OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the 
 SHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:15 p.m. on August 9, 2019; however, this inmate transfer 
 was not documented until approximately 12:35 a.m. on August 10, 2019. Based on this internal transfer, 
 BOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. SHU inmate 
 counts on August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, 
 which did not show correctional officers walking up or down the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers 
 during the count times, a process that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.° During their 
 OIG interviews,' _ _  the Material Handler 
 leach admitted that they did not conduct all of the mandatory 
 rounds and inmate counts in the SHU on the evening of August 9 and the morning of Au yst 10. 
 'The OIG did not credit'  tatement based 
 on:  
 65 5 C.F.R. § 2635.705(a); see also S C.F.R. § 2635.101(bX5). 
 66 BOP Program Statement 3420.11. 
 67 BOP Program Statement 5500.14. 
 68 As discussed in Chapter 5, OIG found that the security camera video was of low quality. Therefore, the OIG analyzed 
 the video in conjunction with BOP records and witness statements regarding the personnel in the SHU and their 
 activities.

 land (4) the Material Handlers 
 statement to the OIG that no one conducted the 10:00 p.m. count because everyone was tired. 
 Instead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found 
 that officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, including the Material Handler, 
 primarily remained seated in the SHU Officers' Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time, 
 suggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of internet searches on MCC New York 
 computers. All The 
 OIG's analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately 10:40 p.m., no 
 Correctional Officer entered Epstein's tier in the SHU until just before 6:30 a.mj 
 The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Material 
 Handler,' railed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their 
 respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that their actions constituted 
 violations of S C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
 MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
 2. False Statements and Lack of Candor 
 The OIG's investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019 
  he Material Handleri I made false statements when they falsified BOP records by 
 attesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not. 
 Federal law provides that "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the 
 Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...makes or uses any false writing or document 
 knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry" has violated 
 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
 As discussed above, the OIG found that the Material Handler, 
 failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each 
 institutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two correctional officers 
 to conduct each count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York 
 form, often called a count slip.69 On the count slip, both correctional officers are required to fill in the date 
 and time the count had been performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
 counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional officers complete and sign the count slips, the 
 count slips are then collected and delivered to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the 
 Control Center are responsible for comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's 
 overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each inmate was accounted for.7° Only after all the count slips 
 have been collected from each housing unit and the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the

 institution's overall inmate count sheet, could the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or completed. 
 the Material Handler 
 signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability 
 responsibilities when, in fact, they had not." These individuals admitted to the OIG that instead of 
 performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed 
 were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the 
 documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts.

 The Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12:00

 to the OIG that on the evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not 
 conduct the mandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.

 6. The BOP should develop and implement a plan to address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 Since at least 2015, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including 
 medical staffing shortages." This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies 
 on inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts-24 hours straight—
 on August 9, 2019, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for 
 inmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the 10:00 p.m. 
 SHU inmate count because they were tired.'

 Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the O16 that on August 9, 2019, he worked in the Control Center from 
 approximately 4:00 p.m. until 12:00 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from 12:00 a.m. until 
 8:00 a.m. on August 10. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 10:00 p.m. 
 institutional count by himself in the Control Center, and assisted with the 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 
 a.m. counts on August 10 as an internal officer. Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC 
 New York records reflect, that he had received verbal counts from all units by 10:30 p.m., and further stated 
 that he had cleared the institutional count at 10:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the 
 count was officially complete. 
 Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York 10:00 p.m. institutional count, which showed that the 
 SHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned 
 to the unit. When questioned by the OIG about the 10:00 p.m. SHU count slip that listed "73 + 1" inmates 
 and was signed by the[ and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed 
 that the "+ 1" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the 10:00 
 p.m. Receiving and Discharge count slip, which listed "95 + 1" on the count slip, and told the OIG that it was 
 his handwriting.36 Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the "9S + 1" on the SHU count slip meant that he 
 was "ghost counting" the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area, 
 to the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there 
 were, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the 10:00 p.m. count, he should have written "73 - 1" on 
 the SHU count slip rather than "73 + 1".

 Senior Officer Specialist 6 did not recall if he wrote on the count slips at the time of the 10:00 p.m. count or 
 during the 12:00 a.m. count when Inmate 4 was transferred in SENTRY from the SHU to Receiving and 
 Discharge. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the 10:00 
 p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count 
 sheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the 
 inaccurate SHU count slip. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have

 precisely who gave him the authorization or when he had done so  
 3. The 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. SHU Counts on August 10 
 During his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate 
 transfer, the 12:00 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this 
 material, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the 12:00 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued 
 to list 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior 
 Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. 
 counts and told the OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.

 Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff 
 members were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with 
 transporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then followed the 
 ambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.

 4. Clearing the 10:00 p.m. Institutional Count Knowing that It Was Inaccurate 
 The OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff cleared the 
 10:00 p.m. institutional count knowing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate. 
 During his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admitted that 
 he amended the 10:00 p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an 
 attempt to reflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU following the internal inmate transfer that 
 resulted in a SHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day. Senior 
 Officer Specialist 6 acknowledged that he should have requested a recount from the SHU, but instead he 
 cleared the 10:00 p.m. count. Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was known as 
 "ghost counting," something he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations 
 Lieutenant or someone of a higher rank than himself.

 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 
 from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved 
 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, 
 a Material Handler, Correctional Officer 2, and Correctional Officer Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge stated that when he began his shift, Epstein was visiting with his attorneys in the attorney 
 conference room. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a 
 conversation with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised 
 that the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge stated, "I don't necessarily want to call anyone a liar() per se, but I don't remember him 
 speaking to me about this. So, maybe he spoke to (Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe I was standing 
 there, and he thought I heard him." The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC 
 New York with all of his belongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him 
 because Epstein was required to have a cellmate. 
 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he eventually learned later that evening that 
 Epstein did not have a cellmate. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after Epstein 
 returned from his attorney visit and placed a telephone call, he escorted Epstein to his cell and saw that 
 Inmate 3 was not there. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that 
 Epstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU 
 that evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
 SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch 
 SHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that 
 Epstein did not have a cellmate.

 the actions of another inmate.!

 In his interview with the OIG. the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknowledged that neither he nor 
 any other SHU staff member conducted the 4:00 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4:00 p.m. SHU count slip and said 
 he had prepared the count slip ahead of time because "Where was so much going on" in the SHU that day. 
 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel's name and signature also appeared on the 
 4:00 p.m. count slip.33 During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP 
 documents regarding the inmate's transfer from the SHU and acknowledged further that based on that 
 transfer, the number of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submitted for the 4:00 p.m. count, 
 the count slip was incorrect.

 The available video showed that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted  toward the L 
 Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge.%  
 " The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the 10 South Unit to be of low quality. Due to the 
 video's low quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe 
 movement of Individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively Identify the individuals. The OIG was 
 also not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera 
 only captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers. The OIG found that movements captured on the 
 video were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented 
 in BOP records.

 the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge,

 assigned pos and served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.59 The OIG 
 investigation found that each of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all 
 times per the Psychology Department's directive. 
 The OIG further found that on August 9 the Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge' became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein's 
 cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all 
 MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the 
 institution.

 The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHUM the Evening 
 Watch SHU Officer in Charge  became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening 
 Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein's 
 telephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed 
 the need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG 
 that he notified an unspecified supervisor. 
 The OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2019  the Evening 
 Watch SHU Officer in Chargr failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein's cellmate was 
 permanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of 
 conduct. Additionally  inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none IMMI
 documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, officers 
 failed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not 
 immediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who 
 had been released from suicide watch and psychological observation 10 days earlier had an appropriate 
 cellmate.

 The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
 failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts du ing 
 respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that   • ctions constitute 
 violations of S C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
 MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
 2. False Statements 
 The OIG's investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in 
 Charge,' made false statements when falsified BOP records by 
 attesting thatislhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact had not. 
 Federal law provides that "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the 
 Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...makes or uses any false writing or document 
 knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry' has violated 
 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
 As discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge  
 failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each 
 institutional inmate count BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two correctional officers 
 to conduct each count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York 
 form, often called a count slip.69 On the count slip, both correctional officers are required to fill in the date 
 and time the count had been performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
 counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional officers complete and sign the count slips, the 
 count slips are then collected and delivered to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the 
 Control Center are responsible for comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's 
 overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each inmate was accounted for.7° Only after all the count slips 
 have been collected from each housing unit and the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the

 Additionally, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9, 2019, said he and all other SHU staff were 
 aware of Epstein's cellmate requirement.

 ge said that since he had the most experience and 
 seniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge,' 
  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a 
 cellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or 
 psychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant 
 had instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch 
 SHU Officer in Charge, between July 30 and August 9, 2019, he told all other MCC New York staff members 
 who worked in the SHU of Epstein's cellmate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in 
 the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knowledge, training, 
 and experience. 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2019, the SHU staff 
 received an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as "WAB," which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was 
 being removed from MCC New York. He told the O16 that sometime between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., he 
 escorted Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for Epstein's daily legal visit, during which 
 time Epstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were 
 accompanied by Correctional  Officer 1, who was escortin: Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day 
 Watch SHU Officer in Charge    told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to 
 Receiving and Discharge with all of his belongings  said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge informed Epstein that he would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3's departure 
 and the requirement that Epstein have a cellmate 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he and Correctional Officer 1 left 
 the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities 
 Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants' Office and should have seen that Inmate 
 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office. 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York, 
 there had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal, 
 only to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances. According to the Day 
 Watch SHU Officer in Charge, he did not select a new cellmate for Epstein because he was not certain that 
 Inmate 3 had been discharged from the institution, although he assumed that Inmate 3 would not return to 
 the SHU. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when his shift ended at approximately 2:00 
 p.m., he informed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Senior Officer Specialist 5 that, if Inmate 3 
 did not return to the SHU, Epstein would need a new cellmate upon Epstein's return from his attorney visit. 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he specifically recalled telling the Evening Watch SHU Officer in 
 Charge, in the presence of Senior Officer Specialist 5, "Make sure this guy gets a bunkie," to which the 
 Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge replied, "All right." The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that, at 
 48 
 Limited Official Use Only—Not for Public Release 
 EFTA00035973
Limited Official Use Only—Not for Public Release 
 some point that day, it was likely that he also informed the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, but he could 
 not specifically recall if he had done so. 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that a replacement cellmate should have been identified 
 as soon as it was confirmed that Inmate 3 had left the institution. He said a new cellmate could have been 
 reassigned before the 4:00 p.m. SHU count if it was known that Inmate 3 was not coming back, but the SHU 
 staff members had until Epstein returned from his attorney visit to assign Epstein a new cellmate. 
 According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, SHU staff definitely should have realized that Inmate 3 
 was not returning both during the 4:00 p.m. count and when Epstein returned from his attorney visit later 
 that evening. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein's daily routine was that he 
 would be with his attorneys in the attorney conference room until approximately 8:00 p.m., so SHU 
 personnel had time to make a new cellmate assignment. He said all SHU staff members shared the 
 responsibility to find a replacement cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found 
 another inmate to replace Inmate 3. However, he also said that due to Epstein's high profile, the SHU 
 personnel should have asked a lieutenant to contact the Psychology Department to see which inmate 
 should be placed with Epstein. 
 On August 12, 2019, following Epstein's death, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge wrote a memorandum 
 to the Warden stating, "On Friday August 9, 2019 at approximately 1:50 p.m., I S/O/S [the Day Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge] passed on to oncoming staff member [the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge] and 
 present shift staff [Senior Officer Specialist 5] and [Correctional Officer 2] that Inmate [3] was going WAB 
 [i.e., with all of his belongings] and possibly may not return. Also that Inmate Epstein #76318-054 will be 
 needing a cell mate upon arrival from his attorney visit" The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge departed the 
 SHU at approximately 2:00 p.m. and worked an overtime shift as a driver for MCC New York. He stated that 
 he did not follow up with the SHU staff to verify that Epstein had been assigned another cellmate. 
 i llEM=1 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, told the OIG that' 
 knew stein was required to have a cellmate pursuant to the Psychology Department's determination. 
 confirmed that everyone who regularly worked in the SHU knew of this requirement, and that it 
 was the
 E 
 responsibility of all SHU staff to notify a supervisor upon learning that Epstein needed to be 
 assigned a new cellmate due to Inrnate 3's transfer to another prison. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge 
 tou the OIG that aware of Inmate 3's transfer and the need to 
 assign Epstein a new cellmate 
 the Day Watch SHU Officer 
 in Charge told the OIG that he made a number of notifications, 
 I

Limited Official Use Only—Not for Public Release 
 the Day Watch 
 SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a "cheat sheet," which lists the number of 
 inmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time. 
 When interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4:00 p.m. SHU count slip 
 from August 9, 2019, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Correctional Officer 
 Noel. Based on his review, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge and Noel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote down 
 the numbers they thought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately 
 included an inmate (Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been 
 transferred to another housing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, 
 earlier that afternoon the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 attempt to retrieve an 
 unknown item from his visitor in h MCC New YorkS '•' 
 According to 
 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the inaccurate 4:00 p.m. count slip told him "that the count was not 
 done and they just assumed and went by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,l
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in 
 Charge told the OIG that if the 4:00 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch 
 SHU Officer in Charge and the SHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.

 every day. He said that the Warden, lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told 
 the SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein. To reinforce this message, the Day Watch 
 SHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officers area 
 that said, "MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 76318.054 
 AS PER GOD!!!!" The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said the sign was hangin on the com uter on Au ust 
 9 and 10, 2019, and it was clearly visible to everyone who worked in the SHU.

 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the O16 that at least five cell searches should be conducted on 
 the day and night watch shifts within the SHU, and that cell searches are conducted in cells every time the 
 inmate departs the cell. He said the SHU Officer in Charge was responsible for making sure the searches 
 were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE database. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
 that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious 
 to enter, and he was busy. He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on 
 August 9, because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their 
 showers. He said that during the period of Epstein's custody, SHU inmates showered on Mondays, 
 Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during showers, SHU staff 
 searched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9 
 because it was a shower day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the 
 recreation area or for attorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein's cell 
 should have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9. He 
 further stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched 
 a Mil 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the O16 that in 
 August 2019, each inmate would have been authorized to 
 have two sheets and one blanket. He said that in the winter, 
 inmates are allowed to have an additional blanket. When 
 interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in 
 Charge reviewed a picture of Epstein's cell from August 10, 
 2019, after Epstein had been removed from the cell. The 
 Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said there appeared to be 
 an excess number of linens and blankets in the cell, which 
 he believed were for both Epstein and Inmate 3, and that 
 there were possibly a couple of extra sheets as well. He 
 noted that there were two mattresses in the cell and 
 deduced that Inmate 3's assigned items had not yet been 
 removed even though he had departed MCC New York 
 earlier that day. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in 
 Charge, Inmate 3's items should have been removed as 
 soon as the SHU staff knew Inmate 3 was not returning. He 
 told the OIG that any extra linens or blankets should be 
 removed when the inmates take showers and their cells are 
 searched. He told the OIG that he believed the purpose of 
 limiting the linens provided to the inmates was to ensure 
 there was enough to go around and that it was more of an administrative matter rather than a security

 On August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
 were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly 
 assigned post and served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.S9 The OIG 
 investigation found that each of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all 
 times per the Psychology Department's directive. 
 The OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
 became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein's 
 cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all 
 MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the 
 institution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge
 ar—r-a 
 Ireviewed the MCC New York 
 daily call out list, a document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, 
 which listed Inmate 3 as being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings.  
 t he Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the 
 SHU to the attorney conference room fort daily meeting with his attorneys. 6° During the escort, the Day 
 Watch SHU Officer in Char,,.• discussed the need to assign Epstein with a new  
 cellmate due to Inmate 3's transfer.b1 I he Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG  
 that he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified 
 lieutenant. However, the OIG did not credit the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge's account because no 
 other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in fact passed on information regarding Epstein's need 
 for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.

 The OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge,  
 failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein's ce mate was 
 permanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of 
 conduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because n 
 individuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally,  officers 
 failed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not 
 immediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who 
 had been released from suicide watch and psychological observation 10 days earlier had an appropriate 
 cellmate.

 August 9; however, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches 
 within the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties. The Day Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge further stated that any of the SHU staff could have logged the cell searches into 
 TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily h SHU Officer in arge s responsibility to do so.

 required cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU,) 
 Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU 
 Officer in Charge who served as the SHU Officer in 
 Charge during their respective shifts on August 9 and 10, 2019, to have permitted Epstein to have an 
 excessive amount of linens in his cell.

 breakfast to Epstein through the food slot in his locked 
 cell door, Epstein did not respond to Thomas's verbal 
 commands. Thomas unlocked the cell door and saw 
 Epstein hanged. Thomas immediately yelled for Noel 
 to get help and call for a medical emergency. 
 Thomas told the OIG that when he entered Epstein's 
 cell, Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a 
 sheet or a shirt, around his neck that was tied to the 
 top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended 
 from the top bunk in a near-seated position, with his 
 buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off 
 the floor. Thomas said he immediately ripped the 
 orange string from the bunkbed, and Epstein's buttocks 
 dropped to the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein's 
 body to the floor and began chest compressions until 
 responding MCC New York staff members arrived 
 approximately 1 minute later. Shortly thereafter, 
 outside medical personnel arrived and took over the 
 emergency response, eventually removing Epstein to a 
 local hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
 On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical 
 Examiner performed an autopsy and determined the 
 cause of death was hanging and the manner of death 
 was suicide. Blood toxicology tests did not reveal any 
 medications or illegal substances in Epstein's system. 
 The Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy told 
 the OIG that Epstein's injuries were consistent with 
 suicide by hanging and that there was no evidence of 
 defensive wounds that would be expected if his death 
 had been a homicide. Epstein did not have marks on 
 his hands, broken fingernails or debris under them, 
 contusions to his knuckles that would have evidenced a 
 fight, or, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to 
 convulsing from hanging, bruising on his body. 
 On August 10, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the two SHU 
 staff on duty,  land 
 Material Handler Michael Thomas, began delivering 
 breakfast to SHU inmates. Tova unlocked the door to 
 Epstein's SHU tier. When Thomas attempted to deliver 
 ' As detailed in the report, MCC New York had a history of security camera problems.

 The 016 also found that several staff falsified BOP 
 records relating to inmate counts and rounds and 
 lacked candor during their OIG interviews. Two MCC 
 New York employees nd Thomas, were charged 
 criminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges 
 were later dismissed after they successfully fulfilled 
 deferred prosecution agreements. I

 land Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC New 
 York SHU at 12:00 a.m. on August 10, 2019.5 During their shift, they each created and submitted falsified 
 official BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as "count slips"),I 
 Thomas did not work his regular 4:00 p.m. to 12: 00 a.m. 
 shift as a Material Handler in a different location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU 
 from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. on August 10, 2019.

 On November 19, 2019, a federal grand ry of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York 
 returned an indictment that chargennd Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple 
 counts each of falsification of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001(a)(3), and 2. The indictment 
 alleged that on August 9, 2019,1 
  and that on August 10, 2019, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the 
 mandatory 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. counts and mandatory 30-minute rounds within the MCC 
 New York SHU. The indictment further alleged that j and Thomas created, certified, and submitted false 
 documentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to 
 perform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU, 
 including Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact no correctional officer had checked on 
 Epstein from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019, until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 2019, 
 when Epstein was found hanged in his cell. 
 On May 25, 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred 
 prosecution agreements with le and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court 
 record in their cases, included admissions band Thomas that they falsely certified that they had 
 conducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely 
 disclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the U.S. 
 Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete 100 hours of 
 community service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision 
 and their establishment of good behavior. On December 13, 2021, after Inland Thomas successfully 
 fulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the U.S. 
 District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all charges 
 pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
 New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count slips and 
 round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein's death. 
 As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report the OIG found that, in addition to and 
 Thomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor 
 judgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties. 
 II. Methodology 
 During the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one 
 occasion. The witnesses interviewed included Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the 
 SHU on Au ust 9-10 • MCC New York 
 6 These BOP forms are officially entitled " Official Count Slip" and "MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute 
 Check sheer Each of the six tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-

 Material Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August 10 from 12:00 
 a.m. until 8:00 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on 
 numerous previous occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he 
 knew that if an inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a 
 cellmate, and said he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological 
 observation. Therefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, but said no one had 
 spoken with him about that requirement. Thomas said the SHU staff should have notified the Operations 
 Lieutenant as soon as they knew that Epstein's cellmate had departed MCC New York on August 9. 
 However, Thomas said he did not know that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and 
 that Epstein was without a cellmate during his shift on August 10.

 c a, At approximately 12r. -n. on August 10, 2019, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material 
 Handler, and he an .  were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. and Thomas were 
 responsible for conducting the 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and 
 analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that 
 andThomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless b 1. nd Thomas completed and 
 signed SHU count slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center 
 cleared the 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. institutional counts at approximately 12:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., 
 and 5:30 a.m., respectively A and Thomas both admitted to the OIG that they did not conduct the 12:00 
 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. counts on August 10, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.

 Thomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2007, he had worked in the SHU fairly 
 regularly and he was familiar with how to work in the SHU and how the SHU operated. Thomas described 
 his responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are 
 fed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their showers. Thomas's Overtime Schedule showed 
 that he worked 21 shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2019. The overtime 
 schedule also showed that Thomas worked 12 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the 
 SHU in July and August 2019. 
 Thomas acknowledged that neither he nor Noel conducted any rounds or counts in the SHU during their 
 shift between approximately 12:00 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m. Thomas said the August 10, 2019 
 round sheets were signed, but the rounds were not conducted because he was tired that day. Thomas 
 recalled "dozing off from here and there" during his shift, but he did not know if Noel slept. 
 Thomas did not recall having a conversation with anyone concerning the discrepancy between the 12:00 
 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 73 inmates, and the institutional count, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU. 
 Thomas said he had filled out and signed the 3:00 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU. 
 Thomas did not know why the number of inmates was different on the 12:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. count slips 
 and did not recall speaking with the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant about the 12:00 a.m. count. 
 Thomas told the OIG that he knew he was falsely certifying the count slips when he signed them on August 
 10, 2019.

 VI. Epstein's Death on August 10 
 A. Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response 
 On August 10, 2019, shortly after 6:00 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of 
 breakfast carts had arrived at the SHU   nd Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-
 locked entrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas andl  ere the only 
 officers in the SHU. At approximately 6:30 a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings show  
 and Thomas walking toward the L Tier. nd Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering 
 the L Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, 
 between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, the OIG did not 
 observe on the available recorded video any correctional officers or other individuals approach the L Tier 
 where Epstein was housed from the common area of the SHU. 
 Thomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein's cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the window 
 but could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, "Come to the door, come to the door.' Thomas 
 said he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell, 
 and saw Epstein hanged as described further below. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get 
 help, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps 
 described below.

 Figure 5.3: Photograph of a Piece of Orange Cloth Hanging from the Bunkbed in Epstein's Cell 
 Following His Death 
 Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein's cell, 
 Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a 
 shirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the 
 top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the 
 top bunk in a near-seated position, with his buttocks 
 approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his 
 legs extended out straight on the floor. Thomas said Epstein 
 did not look discolored or very different from when he last 
 saw Epstein alive. Thomas said he immediately ripped the 
 orange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein's 
 buttocks dropped approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half to 
 the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein's entire body to 
 the floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was 
 breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest 
 compressions until responding MCC New York staff members 
 arrived approximately 1 minute later. Thomas said he did not 
 provide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead 
 or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating 
 chest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took 
 over the emergency response, including chest compressions 
 and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when they arrived. Thomas said he assisted with 
 bringing Epstein down to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and that he left MCC New York at 
 approximately 8:00 a.m. Thomas said he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training during 
 MCC New York annual refresher training and had responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this 
 was the first time he was the first responder. 
 Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on August 10, 2019, from 12:00 a.m. until the 
 time he attempted to deliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:30 a.m., and did not see anyone go 
 inside Epstein's cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have known if someone went in or out of 
 Epstein's cell, and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see Epstein's cell door from the SHU 
 Officers' Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage point. Thomas said that it was not 
 possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knowledge because he or Noel would have had to 
 open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to the SHU was located in the Control 
 Center; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys required to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, 
 Thomas said that anyone attempting to access the L Tier where Epstein was located would have had to walk 
 directly in front of the SHU Officers' Station where Thomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that 
 he or Noel had any role in Epstein's death.

 Instead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found 
 that officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, including and Thomas, 
 primarily remained seated in the SHU Officers' Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time, 
 suggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of internet searches on MCC New York 
 computers. Thomas also admitted to the OIG that he "dozed off for periods of time during his shift. The 
 OIG's analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately 10:40 ..m., no 
 Correctional Officer entered Epstein's tier in the SHU until just before 6:30 a.m. when  d Thomas 
 began to serve breakfast to the inmates. 
  Invf igation and review concluded that 
 and Thomas failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their 
 respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that their actions constituted 
 violations of S C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
 MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
 2. False Statements and Lack of Candor 
 The OIG's investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019, 
 land Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by 
 attesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not. 
 Federal law provides that "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the 
 Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...makes or uses any false writing or document 
 knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry" has violated 
 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
 As discussed above, the OIG found that 
  and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each 
 institutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two correctional officers 
 to conduct each count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York 
 form, often called a count slip.69 On the count slip, both correctional officers are required to fill in the date 
 and time the count had been performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
 counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional officers complete and sign the count slips, the 
 count slips are then collected and delivered to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the 
 Control Center are responsible for comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's 
 overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each inmate was accounted for.7° Only after all the count slips 
 have been collected from each housing unit and the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the 
 69 This BOP form is officially entitled "Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip." 
 7 ° The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is "Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet."

 institution's overall inmate count sheet, could the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or completed. 
  and Thomas each prepared and/or 
 signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability 
 responsibilities when, in fact, they had not?' These individuals admitted to the OIG that instead of 
 performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed 
 were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the 
 documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts. 
 and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and 
 rounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office 
 for the Southern District of New York. 
 The OIG investigation has found that 
 and Thomas knowingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by attesting that they 
 had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2019, and morning of 
 August 10, 2019.

 External Auditing Branch 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
 Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
 Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP or Bureau) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to 
 the Office of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on December 22, 2024. 
 The Bureau has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding 
 the analysis and its recommendations. 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
 the particular individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The BOP has 
 indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation 
 process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) 
 fi nalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized policy to the OIG for 
 review. 
 EFTA00036006
FBOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the Bureau's previous status update, the 
 Bureau is in the process of revising Program Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate 
 Program Review, to address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must 
 follow the normal policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to 
 Program Statements must follow the normal Bureau development and Union negotiation process, 
 they are subject to change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
 risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
 until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
 plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
 individual or security considerations. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
 negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
 finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: Please see the Bureau's status update to Recommendation One, above. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
 and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
 process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5324.08 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
 negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
 finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the Bureau's previous status update, the 
 Bureau is in the process of revising Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program, to 
 address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal 
 policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to Program Statements 
 must follow the normal Bureau development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to 
 change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they become available.

 Aerations Lieutenant 
 Possible Suicide Attempt 
 On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
 was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
 had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
 t -shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
 Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red 
 with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
 to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
 hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
 being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
 staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
 inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
 watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
 edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
 first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
 attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
 action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
 "Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
 behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
 left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
 who stated that inmate E tein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
 had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
 him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
 matter. 
 I photographed and spoke with inmate who stated 
 that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
 said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
 saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
 methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
 negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
 after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy revisions referenced in its update; and (2) provides the 
 fi nalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of Bureau's previous status update, the Bureau 
 is in the process of revising Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures 
 Manual, to address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must follow the 
 normal policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to Program 
 Statements must follow the normal Bureau development and Union negotiation process, they are 
 subject to change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they become available. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
 conducting a round. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
 revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
 also previously indicated that the policy revisions will require Lieutenants to conduct training 
 sessions that allow for individual assessment and training regarding conducting rounds to be 
 tailored to the needs of each individual facility. The BOP has indicated that these revisions must 
 follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will 
 consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the policy revisions 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: Please see the Bureau's status update to Recommendation Four, above. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
 address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has reported 
 that it has implemented the staffing tool for all professions, but that it is still working on several 
 other initiatives regarding staffing, including analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of 
 both recruitment and retention incentives, analyzing whether the new incentives and nation-wide 
 direct hire authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage, 
 and establishing a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions. The OIG will continue 
 to monitor the BOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. In addition, per the 
 OIG's communications with the BOP, we believe that certain information that the BOP has 
 EFTA00036008
provided or will provide to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will 
 facilitate the resolution and closure of this recommendation. Accordingly, we will consider 
 whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG any additional 
 contractor and BOP work product that has been submitted to the GAO in response to the GAO 
 Staffing Audit recommendations,; (2) provides the OIG an update on the contractor's or BOP's 
 analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, whether submitted yet to GAO or not; (3) 
 provides the OIG any additional reports submitted to Congressional appropriation committees 
 related to staffing; and (4) provides the OIG with an update on the salary proposal submitted to 
 OPM, including whether OPM has approved or disapproved of the pay table proposals. 
 FBOP Response: O1O indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
 the Bureau: 
 1. Provides any additional contractor and BOP work product that has been submitted 
 to the GAO in response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations. 
 Please see the Bureau's response to GAO's staffing audit recommendations (attachment "Rec 6 
 GAO Staffing Audit response"). 
 2. Provides an update on the contractor's or BOP's analysis of staffing incentives since 
 March 2023, whether submitted yet to GAO or not. 
 Following GAO's recommendation, the Bureau developed four goals: 1) Increase overall 
 employee retention by 5% compared to historical retention rate; 2) Increase Correctional Officer 
 retention by 10% compared to historical retention rate; 3) Increase New Hire retention by 10% 
 compared to historical retention rate; and 4) Increase Nurse Practitioner retention by 10% 
 compared to historical retention rate. These goals were developed based on the Bureau's most 
 pressing needs and high-risk positions and were formalized in the 2023 Bureau Incentives 
 Playbook. Additionally, to provide a holistic understanding of the effectiveness of the Bureau's 
 incentives usage, an assessment of FY2024 local awards and incentives was conducted after 
 tracking this information for a full year and collecting local awards data across all Bureau 
 institutions. The report details monetary awards spending, time off hours awarded, and 
 recruitment and referral awards distributed at the local level. 
 Based on the analysis, the Bureau has begun to achieve the four identified goals. Between 
 FY2023 and FY2024, the Bureau saw notable improvement in overall employee retention rates, 
 increasing from 90.7% in FY2023 to 93.9% in FY2024, an increase of 3.2%. For Correctional 
 Officers specifically, the position saw a retention rate increase of 3.9%, from 91.8% in FY2023 
 to 95.7% in FY2024. Additionally, Nurse Practitioners retention increased by 6.2%, from 85.8% 
 in FY2023 to 92% in FY2024. Additional data is pending to review whether the Bureau is 
 meeting its goal for New Hires. 
 Due to budgetary constraints, the Bureau is reducing or eliminating our use of incentives 
 effective March 23, 2025. 
 EFTA00036009
3. Provides any additional reports submitted to Congressional appropriation 
 committees related to staffing. 
 The Bureau has no further information to provide regarding reports submitted to Congressional 
 appropriation committees related to staffing. However, the Bureau's funding proposal seeks 
 $1,000,730,000 over the next five years to cover Special Salary Rates for the Bureau's current 
 authorized levels of corrections officers and covered nurses; and an increase of 4,500 
 Correctional Officer positions and 200 nurses along with $1,570,000,000 to fund those positions. 
 The increase in positions is based on projections from the newly launched Automated Staffing 
 Tool. 
 4. Provides an update on the salary proposal submitted to OPM, including whether 
 OPM has approved or disapproved of the pay table proposals. 
 The Bureau has not received any updates nor been advised of any adjudications related to the 
 submitted Special Salary Requests for Correctional Officers and Nurses. Both requests are still 
 under OPM review and pending an outcome. The Bureau will continue to evaluate and submit 
 special salary rate requests during the annual OPM data call for individual institution and 
 positions; however, no additional nationwide proposals are being considered at this time. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
 system functionality checks. 
 OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG reviewed the 
 BOP's new Security Camera Monthly Report and appreciates the progress the BOP has made in 
 creating this form and instituting the new monthly reporting process. Accordingly, the OIG will 
 consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the policy updates 
 referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
 FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statements 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, and 4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual, are being 
 modified to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various aspects of the 
 Bureau's camera systems, including but not limited to functionality, documentation, and repair. 
 Because revisions to Program Statements must follow the normal development and Union 
 negotiation process, they are subject to change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they 
 become available.

 MEMORANDUM FOR 
 ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
 INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
 FROM: Sectio Chief 
 External Auditing Branch 
 SUBJECT: Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
 Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
 Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
 Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
 The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office of the 
 Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on June 26, 2023. The BOP has 
 completed our review of the analysis and we offer the following status update regarding the analysis 
 and its recommendations. 
 Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
 following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
 particular individual or security considerations. 
 BOP's Response: Reentry Services Division (RSD) and Correctional Programs Division (CPD) 
 are collaborating on a CEO memo to provide guidance to the field on a process to ensure 
 psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of a cellmate, 
 for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. This process 
 will include exemptions based on individual or security considerations. 
 Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
 suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
 recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
 EFTA00036011
re -assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
 considerations. 
 BOP's Response: RSD and CPD are collaborating on a CEO memo to provide guidance to the 
 field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
 individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
 psychologist. This will include a procedure for exemptions based on individual or security 
 considerations. 
 Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
 documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
 psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
 provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
 mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
 observation. 
 BOP's Response: The BOP is currently evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting 
 approval for social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
 observation. This evaluation will inform future guidance on this issue. 
 Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
 whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
 through policy, training, or other measures. 
 BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is currently being updated to include additional inmate 
 accountability aspects. 
 Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
 conducting a round. 
 BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Program Statement 5500.14, 
 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is currently being updated to include clarification on 
 the requirements for conducting Lieutenant rounds. 
 Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
 staffing shortages at its prisons. 
 BOP's Response: As of June 2023, the BOP has deployed an automated staffing tool for 
 institution correctional services departments to be evaluated. The tool continues to be tested and 
 evaluated as we prepare to move forward with additional disciplines/departments throughout the 
 BOP. Other efforts to retain qualified personnel include but are not limited to the various 
 recruitment and retention incentives the BOP currently offers that are available to staff to include 
 staggered retention incentives for all who were retirement eligible as of December 31, 2022. In 
 March 2023, the Director authorized a bureau-wide recruitment incentive of $10,000 or 25% on 
 initial salary (whichever is greater), for newly hired Correctional Officers who onboard between 
 EFTA00036012
March 26, 2023, through September 24, 2023. That incentive was recently extended to 
 Correctional Officers who enter on duty with an effective date no later than December 17, 2023. 
 Further, in July 2023, the Director approved a Bureau-wide retention incentive for all 
 Lieutenants. Additionally, the BOP continues to seek other viable pay options for Correctional 
 Officers in an effort to remain competitive and attractive to new applicants. 
 Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
 as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
 BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As such, our policies will be 
 discussed with staff during regular rounds to ensure current procedures are followed where it 
 relates to cell searches. 
 Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
 security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
 capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
 functionality checks. 
 BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Policy will be updated to 
 include the regular functionality checks.

 arrived TOY February 2019 we, only had one Communication Technician. Therefore, after talking to

 I didn't want to leave you hanging so this is what we know so far: 
 It appears that FedEx must recycle tracking numbers. The order was placed on 9/27/2018 from 
 SigNet to Qognify/Nice and the original PO shows it was shipped directly to the site MCC New York. It 
 shows that it was scheduled to ship on 9/30/2018 from Qognify. We currently don't have the tracking 
 that shows when you exactly received it but best guess is 7 to 14 days which would put it on your 
 dock around October 14th 2018 and it was installed the week of August 16th 2019. 
 We will continue to try and find the tracking information for when it actually hit your dock. Let me 
 know if you need anything else.

 SUBJECT: 
 On July 23, 2019 at approximately 1:27, 1, S.O.S responded to a body alarm on the 
 Special Housing Unit. While the 9-South officer was conducted rounds inmate Epstein, Jeffrey 
 #76318-054 was found in his cell with a noose around his neck and appeared to be unresponsive. 
 I assisted with taking inmate Epstein #76318-054 from his cell and putting him on a stretcher. 
 The inmate was taken to the second floor and placed on suicide watch, where he was monitored by 
 staff. Moments afterwards, inmate Epstein became responsive. While obs • • 
 e sat un on the bed and began telling me that he think his Runkle, 
 tried to kill him. Inmate Epstein also stated that his Bunkie also tried to extort 
 money from him and stated that if he didn't pay him that he would beat him up. He stated that 
 this has been going on for a week. I asked inmate Epstein if he told staff about this and he told 
 me no, that he'd only told his lawyer. He went on to say that his Bunkie told him that if he beat 
 him up, because of his charges, the officers would not report it and because of this he was not 
 comfortable telling the officers about the prolong threats and alleged attempts to extort him. I 
 immediately reported this to the lieutenant.

 Please review for accuracy before I send to. 
 here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
 7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population 
 (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming 
 so no pkans had been established). 
 7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his 
 personal safety in general population. 
 7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by 
 Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was 
 under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
 7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

 ANALYSIS OF EVENTS 
 Inmate Epstein arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019, as a pre-
 trial commit. It appears the staff receiving Inmate Epstein were 
 not aware of his broad publicity and placed him within general 
 population as a typical inmate. The following day he was placed 
 in SHU, reportedly at the direction of the Warden. It is unclear 
 how his cellmate was chosen or what method was used to determine 
 appropriateness. A review of the assigned cellmate raises 
 questions concerning the selection process. 
 From his initial placement in SHU, until the date of the incident, 
 Inmate Epstein was outside the institution on four occasions to 
 attend court appearances and spent a considerable amount of time 
 in attorney visitation. His interactions with the various 
 departments was considered ordinary, although Inmate Epstein had 
 many interactions with the Psychology Department. 
 On July 23, 2019, Inmate Epstein was found in a state of 
 unresponsiveness within his SHU cell. The investigation into this 
 incident was inconclusive to determine if the cellmate was 
 involved, if Inmate Epstein had made a suicide attempt or gesture, 
 or if he was feigning the incident in an attempt to gain single 
 cell status. The investigation was completed properly and 
 appropriately without a definitive conclusion. 
 Following the July 23, 2019 incident, psychology staff maintained 
 appropriate contact with Inmate Epstein to assess his condition 
 and level of supervision. Psychology was clear in their 
 recommendation for Inmate Epstein to be housed with another inmate

 When interviewed, he stated he still cannot remember what happened in SHU that caused the marks on 
 his neck. He stated that for the 5 days before that he had only slept about 30 minutes each night 
 because of noise in SHU. He stated he is anxious about going back to SHU because he stated he is 
 going back to a place where he had gotten marks on his neck and he does not know why it happened 
 He said he has an appetite and is eating. He said he is waking up every 1 1/2 hours. He stated he feels 
 dehydrated because he is not drinking enough water because he stated he feels he is not given enough 
 bathroom breaks while with his Attorney. Medical was e-mailed with his complaint of feeling dehydrated. 
 He said his Lawyers and friends are all emotionally supportive. 
 7/28/19 
 The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation 
 cell for about 12 hours per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the 
 "Eating/Shower Chart" may not reflect all of his meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney 
 Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water at night. The Psych Observation log noted he 
 talked about life in general population and he slept. 
 Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse Columbo from Medical had 
 seen him for this. 
 When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he 
 cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse 
 Columbo. 
 He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so 
 aversive and upsetting that he said he sat in the comer and held his ears. He said because of this he 
 was agitated for hours and was not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he 
 was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was 
 in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the 
 person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also really good with numbers

 when returned to SHU. Although this information was distributed 
 on several fronts, by email from a staff psychologist, through 
 individual conversations by the Captain to his Lieutenants, and 
 verbally between SHU Officers, there was ultimately a failure to 
 place a cellmate with Inmate Epstein. 
 On August 10, 2019, the two assigned morning watch SHU Officers 
 failed to make their designated rounds or count the SHU inmates 
 for two counts. At 6:33 am, upon finding Inmate Epstein 
 unresponsive in his cell, with a torn bedsheet around his neck, 
 staff utilized a body alarm to initiate a call for assistance. 
 The medical response to the incident was timely, efficient, and 
 exhaustive. Staff utilized an AED, as well as continuous CPR 
 until care was assumed by EMS personnel. 
 OTHER FACTORS 
 (Directly Related to the Incident) 
 Significant discrepancies exist within SENTRY regarding cell 
 quarters assignments (QTR). Although it is well documented Inmate 
 Epstein was housed with two other inmates during his assignment in 
 SHU, SENTRY does not reflect this information accurately. Inmate 
 Epstein was found within cell 220, yet SENTRY never reflects him 
 being housed within that cell at any time. 
 Significant discrepancies exist within SENTRY regarding 
 admission/release status (ARS). SENTRY does not reflect Inmate 
 Epstein being escorted from the institution by the USMS on 
 July 31, 2019, although a signed Prisoner Remand form is 
 documented receiving him from the USMS. 
 SHU has multiple cells equipped with video recording capability. 
 Inmate Epstein was not housed in one of these cells and there 
 appears to be no set guidance on when to utilize these cells. 
 No notations concerning a requirement for a cellmate were entered 
 into the SHU program, and subsequently available for SHU Officers 
 to reference. 
 An outside person sent $200 each to Inmate Epstein and his 
 cellmate Inmate Reyes. The outside person appears to be Inmate 
 Epstein's attorney. The purpose of this transaction is 
 undetermined at this point. 
 In an email to the Warden, dated post incident, the Supervisory 
 Staff Attorney reported details of a conversation with Inmate

 Epstein's attorneys. Inmate Epstein's attorneys requested he be 
 housed in a single cell, the staff attorney stated Inmate Epstein 
 could not be housed alone due to previous suicide attempt/gesture. 
 During the immediate response to the incident both SHU officers 
 made reference to not completing required rounds and counts. This 
 was documented by the responding Lieutenant. 
 In an email to the Warden, the Captain reported he had "informal 
 training sessions" regarding SHU conditions and the housing of 
 Inmate Epstein specifically. This meeting was held with 
 Correctional Services supervisors and line staff during the week 
 of July 31, 2019. Additionally, the Captain states he spoke with 
 the SHU Lieutenant concerning the need to house Inmate Epstein 
 with a cellmate. 
 The Raxichology intake screening contains errors in identifying 
 details. Inmate Epstein is referred to as a black inmate and a 
 different inmate name is used within the report. 
 There are errors within the Risk of Sexual Abusiveness report, 
 such as referencing an inaccurate program statement and noting a 
 history of prior prison sexual predation. 
 Correctional Services and Health Services are not completing 
 regular rounds of inmates housed under psychology observation. 
 On July 16, 2019, a psychologist met with Inmate Epstein in the 
 presence of his attorneys. This was done at the request of Inmate 
 Epstein and appears to have been for the purpose of airing 
 grievances with conditions of confinement. 
 The Suicide Risk Assessment dated July 23, 2019, refers to the 
 ligature as a "string" when in fact it was a sizable portion of 
 torn bed sheet. 
 On August 1, 2019, Correctional Systems staff reported the USMS 
 concerns from the previous day regarding Inmate Epstein's suicidal 
 tendencies to Psychology staff. It is unknown why this issue was 
 not reported to Psychology the previous day. There was a time 
 delay between this report and Psychology conducting a suicide risk 
 assessment. 
 On August 9, 2019, during a shift change in SHU, the SHU #3 
 6:00 am-2:00 pm officer briefed his 2:00 pm-10:00 pm relief and 
 the other two 8:00 am-4:00 pm officers of the likelihood Inmate

 Reyes, Register Number 85993-054 would not be returning and Inmate 
 Epstein would require a cellmate upon returning from an attorney 
 visit. Inmate Epstein was not placed with a cellmate upon his 
 return to SHU. 
 SHU 30-minunte check documentation shows a trend of missing rounds 
 and rounds which extend beyond the 40-minute limit. 
 Count documentation for August 9, 2019, could not be located. 
 Official count documentation shows all counts were conducted as 
 scheduled, but based cn the statements of the responsible 
 officers, this appears to be inaccurate for at least the 3:00 am 
 and 5:00 am counts. 
 The initial medical screening noted essential hypertension, but 
 did not provide treatment. Upon further review it appears this 
 diagnosis should not have been issued. 
 On July 6, 2019, Health Services notes inmate Epstein has no known 
 allergies. On July 30, 2019, a Modified Diet Request is issued by 
 Health Services with no accompanying medical record note. 
 All psychologists at the institution are state licensed 
 clinicians. 
 Psychology Observation procedures dictate a Physician's Assistant 
 perform daily rounds. This is clearly not possible based on 
 Health Services staffing. 
 It is not uncommon for staff working vital posts, which require 
 effectuating SENTRY transactions, to not have the needed access. 
 A review of inmates housed within the suicide watch cells, during 
 the period of this review, revealed the inmates were not properly 
 assigned within SENTRY. 
 Institution Duty Officers (IDO) do not routinely visit SHU each 
 day as required by the Institution Supplement (I85502.11). 
 Additionally, the IDO reports consistently documents the condition 
 of SHU as "satisfactory", when observations have shown the SHU to 
 be less than satisfactory. 
 The Correctional Services roster requires a complete review to 
 best utilize staffing resources. Currently, the roster appears to 
 have posts which could be reprioritized.

 Staffing changes within the Correctional Services department have 
 changed significantly over the past several years. In May of 
 2018, during pay period 5, the institution lost 21 positions as a 
 result of phase 1 and 2 reductions. These positions consisted of 
 19 correctional officers, 1 lieutenant and 1 SIS technician.

 Overtime 
 The two morning watch SHU staff did not work an unusual amount of 
 overtime leading up to the incident. The SHU #1 was assigned to 
 SHU on mandatory overtime during the incident. This staff member 
 does not typically work a large quantity of overtime. The SHU #2 
 was assigned to SHU on voluntary overtime. This staff member 
 typically works a high volume of overtime on a volunteer basis.

 After a thorough review of all available evidence, the review team 
 concluded there was a significant breakdown in basic correctional 
 practices and communication within the institution. Inmate 
 Epstein was an inmate who fell within multiple suicide risk 
 groups. He was also an inmate who had risk factors for assault by 
 other inmates and did require careful selection for appropriate 
 cellmates. Although these issues were noted, well documented, and 
 communicated, a failure still occurred by allowing Inmate Epstein 
 to be placed in a cell alone. Although feasible for an inmate to 
 effectuate suicide while housed with a cellmate, the odds of this 
 occurring are significantly lowered when housed with another 
 inmate. Without the use of compelled interviews, it is not 
 possible to determine the true root of the communication 
 breakdown. 
 Concerning deficiencies were noted in common functions within the 
 institution. It appears a less than satisfactory state of 
 condition within the Special Housing Unit has become acceptable to 
 responsible staff. The review team observed significant failures 
 in basic tasks such as SENTRY entries for quarters changes to the 
 base count of the facility. Failure in the area of inmate 
 accountability is a substantial finding which will require 
 immediate attention.

 Although inmate suicides do occur, the Bureau of Prisons has 
 developed substantial training resources and processes to mitigate 
 an environment leading to a suicide. While many correctional 
 professionals completed their responsibilities within these 
 processes, the failure to carry out all aspects of the suicide 
 prevention process laid the groundwork for an environment 
 vulnerable to suicide. At the core of this event was a direct 
 dereliction of duty by the assigned correctional workers within 
 the Special Housing Unit. Their failure to perform the most basic 
 of correctional tasks should be viewed as the primary factor which 
 exposed the institution to this event. Had they performed the 
 basic task of counting and viewing inmates within their assigned 
 area, it is possible this suicide could have been detected or a 
 minimum, responded to the event quicker. 
 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 • A multi-disciplinary team assessment should be conducted 
 throughout the institution to determine shortcomings and 
 provide a corrective action plan. 
 • Regional Psychology Administrators should be considered for 
 reinstatement to provide a direct contact to field staff. 
 • The Institution Supplement on Suicide Prevention is not 
 required and occasionally not followed. It is recommended to 
 review the need for having this supplement. 
 • Currently the Drug Abuse Prevention Coordinator (DAPC) has 
 responsibilities between MCC New York and MDC Brooklyn. It 
 is recommended this be reviewed to determine if the 
 responsibilities are appropriately distributed or if they 
 would be better served with an independent DAPC. 
 • A single post should be designated to document all movement 
 within the facility. This should include internal, court, 
 releases, etc. 
 • The Correctional Services roster should undergo a complete 
 review to determine the best possible use of staff resources. 
 • A Deputy Captain should be considered t 
 higher level supervision.

MEMORANDUM FOR 
 FROM: 
 SUBJECT: Retention, Recruitment, and Relocation Incentive 
 Requests for MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York 
 A group retention incentive of 10% and recruitment and 
 relocation incentive of 25% is being requested for MDC Brooklyn 
 and MCC New York. 
 The use of incentives assists the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in 
 retaining highly qualified and experienced staff who routinely 
 consider leaving the agency and for attracting highly qualified 
 applicants. 
 Hiring activity reports for all positions advertised for MDC 
 Brooklyn and MCC New York between Fiscal Years 2016-2018 
 document the following: 
 • Fiscal Year 2016, 229 applicants were referred by CSU to 
 fill 85 positions. Only 69 were selected for positions. 
 • Fiscal Year 2017, 47 applicants were referred by CSU to fill 
 40 positions. Only 12 were selected for positions. 
 • Fiscal Year 2018, 82 applicants were referred by CSU to fill 
 75 positions. Only 12 were selected for positions. 
 EFTA00036099
• The remaining applicants referred for each period listed 
 above either failed pre-employment testing or exceeded 
 hiring guidelines. 
 MDC Brooklyn's and MCC New York's staffing levels are among the 
 lowest in the agency. Currently, their vacancy rate is 12.12% 
 and 15.5% respectively. This is a 7% increase from the previous 
 year. MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York continue to experience 
 difficulty retaining and recruiting qualified employees. Since 
 2017, MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York lost 43 and 30 positions 
 respectively. Responses compiled through the Exit Survey 
 supports reasons for why staff are electing to leave this 
 location: urban location of the institutions and lack of 
 competitive salary compared to other law enforcement agencies in 
 New York City. Additionally, FCI Otisville, located 62 miles 
 from MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York, offers the same salary 
 despite being a lower security institution in a rural setting. 
 Since 2016, MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York has extended retention 
 incentives to health services staff occupying hard-to-fill 
 medical positions and lieutenants, which resulted in the 
 successful recruitment and retention of staff in those 
 occupations. If this retention request of 10% for all eligible 
 employees and recruitment/relocation request of 25% is approved, 
 it may deter current employees from leaving MDC Brooklyn and MCC 
 New York and may assist with attracting other employees to these 
 facilities.

 Hi 
 Ijust received a copy of MCC New York's UST NOV issued 07-15-2019. Attached. 
 I also spoke with He's working to address the NOV. enrolled to obtain Class A & B UST Operator status 
 within the next two weeks. Once he's been designated as the Class A & B Operator he should be able to assume the role of a 
 Class C Operator as well. He's checking with the NY Department of Environmental Conservation to make sure. As a back up 
 plan, (Facilities Manager, Brooklyn) and (General Foreman, Brooklyn) are Class A & B Operators and 
 may be able to temporarily fill that role for MCC New York. 
 Please place this NOV in procedure 009 and use the EMS to document the institution's corrective actions. Don't forget to 
 establish a "flow" by holding an EMS Committee Meeting to create UST Class AM & C Operators objectives and targets (003) 
 and a detailed Environmental Management Plan a, to address training (004), documentation, reporting and record-
 keeping (005, 006..). You may need to work with to draft a new Operational Control (007) to ensure continued 
 compliance in the future (002, 008, 010, 011). 
 Please keep me informed of developments. I'll continue to follow up. 
 Let me know you need anything.

 Here is the game plan: 
 The Corn Tech's are currently un-boxing the new hardware and getting the equipment in the new racks. Need power and 
 network drops and IP Addresses to the new racks. Need to make sure the existing coax jumpers from the old recorders 
 will reach the new racks for cutover between old equipment and new. 
 Jeff McKenzie from SigNet will be on site Monday. He will be sending NCIC forms. 
 The old system will run continuing to record the existing remaining channels until the new system is ready for cutover. 
 First priority is to restore recording to all channels. Redundancy/PTZ control etc. will be converted once recording is 
 restored. 
 The existing analog matrix switch will remain for PTZ control and PLC camera call up. 
 I will provide an update once we are on-site and assess current site conditions.

 DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT (If Use Of Force, Include details such as name of supervisor applying the chemical 
 agent and/or restraints, masons for use of hard restraints instead of soft restraints, etc.) Please be clear about 
 cause(s) of the incident in your description. 
 On July 23. 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit was announced by the Control 
 4 ) Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LA . I 
 observed inmate Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a t-shirt an boxers. 
 He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue 
 snoring. His neck was red with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made to get 
 the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and staff was di ed to 
 retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open h s eyes 
 and observe staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The inmate was lak n to 
 HA -Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide watch. 
 Upon the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP for a circular line of 
 erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front with marks of friction and a sma e hema on his left nee.

 On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
 was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
 had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
 t -shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
 Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red 
 with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
 to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
 hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
 being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
 staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
 inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
 watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
 edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
 first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
 attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
 action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
 "Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
 behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
 left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
 Clark- wh sta tein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
 had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
 im e state e inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
 matter. 
 I photographed and spoke with inmate  who stated 
 that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
 said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
 saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon f,....ner questioning, inmate ..fated that he sleeps on 
 the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
 sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
 remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
 sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
 stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
 Inmate Epstein stated that he came in fricau legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
 handed him a copy of the Daily News. "M" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
 He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that mentioned that he'd 
 been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
 paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
 stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
 report it. (Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
 the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
 seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
 the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
 that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
 thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
 in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
 were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
 noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
 that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
 Duty medical,  was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
 medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
 of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
 i U on the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP I 
 for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
 wit marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

 Good afternoon all, 
 Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and 
 that his CPAP is plugged in? 
 I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, 
 so there is no recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 
 days has elapsed? 
 Thank you,

 Good afternoon Mr. 
 Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was 
 not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
 Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, 
 the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 (1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? 
 (2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his 
 cell? 
 (3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-
 saving measures at the institution? And did EMS drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to 
 the hospital? 
 (4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the 
 hospital? 
 (5) Was the FBI notified? Is it being investigated as a suicide? 
 (6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? 
 (7) What are his specific offense titles for which he is indicted? I believe generally the news calls it sex 
 trafficking, but we should be as specifically accurate based on Sentry (or the court order if we have it).

 Dear Mr. Epstein: 
 I am writing to express my condolences to you regarding the death of your brother, Jeffrey

 On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York

 there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death, it appears to be the result

 sincerest sympathy will be of some comfort to you. 
 Sincerely,

The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting information on Epstein via their 
 personal email. I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email to all staff on the media and who are the only approved 
 staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing 
 information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts. 
 New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

 Hi 
 I hope this finds you well. My name is Christina Goldbaum and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sony to reach out out of the 
 blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. Were trying to learn a little more about the 
 prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be 
 free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). I'd just like to 
 leam a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, and we'd lik speak in concrete 
 terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 
 Thanks, 
 Christina

 so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw 
 him interact with. He did not report any mental health concems and he denied any suicidal thoughts or 
 intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various 
 needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a 
 book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs 
 of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attomeys to work on his legal situation.

 FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS

 New York, NY. 10007 
 SUBJECT: Security Expectations Involving Inmate 
 Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054 
 During the week of July 31, 2019 in order to address management 
 concerns with inmate Epstein. I felt it was necessary to hold informal 
 training sessions with Correctional Services Supervisors and Line 
 Staff assigned to the Special Housing Unit. The informal training 
 sessions was conducted in the Lieutenants Office, inside the SHU, 
 and while conducting rounds throughout the institution. I informed 
 staff of the importance of being vigilant and being security minded 
 when dealing with inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054, and 
 other inmates within the Special Housing Unit. I explained that 
 Lieutenants were to conduct more un announced rounds in the unit, 
 providing oversite over operations and security. I pointed out 
 apparent security concerns such as observation windows being blocked 
 preventing staff from completing proper rounds, torn bed sheets, 
 clothing, covering of light fixtures, clotheslines, and the 
 accumulation of food trays in cells. I made clear of my expectations 
 of maintaining a clean and manageable unit. I explained should we 
 not continue to be proactive in the management of our inmate 
 population, there would be another occurrence of the below describe 
 incident. 
 Inmate Epstein while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
 located in New York City. In the early morning hours of July 23, 
 2019, he was found unresponsive in his cell after an apparent suicide 
 attempt. 
 In detailed conversations with the SHU Lieutenant, he was informed 
 of my expectations regarding the supervision of inmate Epstein. 
 Specifically, he was reminded on several occasions that inmate 
 Epstein was to housed with a cell mate.

 cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him and he had 
 informed his Attorney of this matter.

 clinical encounter. Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot 
 explain the marks on his neck. Responded: "I don't know".

Warden, 
 Per our conversation, I spoke to two of his attorneys yesterday, August 9, 2019, primarily in relation to his request for access to water 
 in attorney conference. Attorney , with whom I spoke in person in the late morning, had asked as an aside whether we 
 would consider housing him in the Cadre. I advised we could not since he was a pretrial inmate. Later that day but prior to the 1:00 
 close-out meeting, I spoke to Attorney on the phone. He had asked whether we could house Mr. Epstein alone in SHU, 
 to which I replied that we could not based on his prior suicide attempt/gesture. He acknowledged that he understood. To my 
 recollection, neither attorney referenced consideration for suicide watch or psychological observation during yesterday's 
 conversations. 
 Please let me know if you need any further information. 
 Thank you, 
 I

 Hello, 
 I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the Jeffrey 
 Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media. 
 We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news 
 first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could 
 have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation? 
 Thank you, 
 Jane

Warden 
 ou for supporting our scheduling of the Psychological Reconstruction for inmate Epstein. I will be joined by Thank
 , Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Region. 
 I am attaching a list of materials we will use to complete the reconstruction. We routinely take these documents with us so 
 please ensure you have a copy of any documents you also need. Your assistance in gathering these documents is appreciated and 
 will be helpful. 
 Organizing and facilitating staff interviews often takes the most time and I am requesting the assistance of an assigned staff member. 
 In the past, wardens commonly have someone from the SIS department or a lieutenant available throughout the reconstruction for this 
 purpose and to track down additional documents as needed. 
 As discussed we will be staying at the Sheraton Tribeca on 370 Canal Street and appreciate your arranging travel to the institution. 
 We will be ready for pickup at 0715 on Tuesday morning and expect to complete the reconstruction by close of business on Thursday. 
 Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

 I did not have the Staff SW Log when I interviewed him today. I found the log in mailbox and when I reviewed them it noted 
 that he told staff watching him that his cellmate tried to kill him and that he was trying to remember what happened. I was not able to 
 ask him about this because he was in legal all afternoon and is still there now.

 EFTA00034651
totally. i wonder if, was mbarr s d/introspective seeing response like that. this is b/c of epstein. he was on SW but in regular 
 clothes on legal visit and questioned it. i told when she asked that we have done it this way in the past. in light of the 
 huge scar on epstein's neck (granted a ton of ambiguity surrounding the incident), he did need to be on SW yesterday. i guess we 
 should have declined his legal visit if we were following this other chiefs advice 
 >» 7/24/2019 8:40 AM >>> 
 lol i love this guy's response. that if this is even a question, they probably shouldn't even be on watch. we put way too many people on 
 there. I'm even seeing the difference in BRO. they just don't function that way. guys come here from MCC and go to SHU, and tell staff 
 they want to go on SW, and the staff laugh at them, and the inmates tell them they were able to get on watch that way at MCC. and 
 the psych who responded to her is at Chicago, another detention center. so, I'm guessing they see a lot of the same things that we do, 
 and probably use SW less as an option.

 Hello, 
 I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics 
 involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the 
 mainstream media. 
 We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 
 45 minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify 
 whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to 
 that, do you have any statement on the situation? 
 Thank you,

 Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. M, Chief Psychologist. He 
 will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
 DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
 disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to 
 deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
 population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed 
 on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming 
 behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
 disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status 
 is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able 
 to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
 inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
 He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore he will return to the S ial 
 Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate Inmate 
 pleaded guilty in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
 including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
 Vice President Joe Biden, formcr Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
 ICamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
 and rants, onc6f them tancting_CNN. His casc has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because

 Hello =, 
 It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving 
 him extra time to review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
 I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of 
 Tartaglione's cell on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I 
 believe that the date and time is July 23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask 
 that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your 
 understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
 relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding 
 officers were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the 
 incident, I am requesting that such footage also be preserved. 
 We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider 
 this email a formal preservation request.

 Hello 
 It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with and giving 
 him extra time to review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
 I am writin to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of 
 cell on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I 
 believe that the date and time is July 23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask 
 that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your 
 understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
 relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding 
 officers were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the 
 incident, I am requesting that such footage also be preserved.

 The National Suicide Prevention Coordinator from Central Office, contacted me today about 
 Epstein. He thought that housing him with another sex offender in SHU would be a good idea. I told him 
 I would speak with the executive staff about his suggestion. Also, thought it wise that we keep 
 him down here for a bit (as is the plan already). 
 I am heading to the hospital in about a half an hour or so. If you need me for anything, feel free to call 
 my cell phone Thank you.

 wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs rather than keeping 
 him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that way when he is interviewed

 Hello, 
 7/24/2019 12:14 PM >>> 
 Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with Dr. who indicated that most likely he will be found 
 competent because he is not mentally ill. We have supporting memorandums from the responding officers who indicated they 
 observed inmate Epstein with a ma hit noose around his neck. Therefore, he will ndin a UDC hearin . Should he return to 
 SHU, he will be housed with inmate . lnmat . He is a 
 Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general 
 population. 
 The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, how inmate and 
 were determine appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell determine 
 mate of inmate M. 
 We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate. 
 If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

 Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. M, Chief Psychologist. He 
 will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
 DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
 disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to 
 deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
 population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed 
 on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming 
 behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
 disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status 
 is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able 
 to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
 inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
 He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
 Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate . Inmate 
 pleaded guilty in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
 including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
 Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (NJ.) and 
 Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
 and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
 h r tested Protcctivc Custody.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he only 
 received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner. 
 Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that. 
 because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to Mr.

 Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD 
 Date of Birth: 01/20/1953 Sex: M Facility: NYM 
 Date: 07/30/2019 12:01 Provider: PsyD 
 Reg #: 76318-054 
 Unit Team: 5 
 Reason for Referral and Identifying Information 
 Inmate Epstein was referred by Unit Manager for an evaluation of competency to proceed with the disciplinary 
 process for actions resulting in an incident report. On 7/23/19, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or 
 Self -Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555. 
 Background Information 
 According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by Dr. "Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental 
 health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present 
 with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time." 
 According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by Dr. "Inmate Epstein denied any past or present 
 suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the 
 past." 
 According to this writer's Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/23/19, 'It is unclear at this time if he had placed the string 
 around his neck or if someone else did." 
 Clinical Interview and Mental Status Exam 
 Inmate Epstein still does not remember how he obtained the marks around his neck. 
 Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with 
 no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were 
 denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no 
 indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene 
 was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to 
 have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He 
 denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts. 
 Clinical Impression 
 According to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by Dr. , "No Diagnosis, No Dx -
 Current"

 The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical 
 assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their 
 own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is 
 COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be 
 restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent. 
 Recommendations ardity_Sanctions

 pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate is: 
 (X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process.

 Supplement 
 OPI: 
 NUMBER: 
 DATE: 
 SUBJECT: 
 CMC 
 NYM 7331.04e 
 November 13, 2014 
 Pretrial Inmates 
 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE: The primary mission of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), New 
 York, is to confine pretrial inmates for the United States Marshals (USM) Service. Pretrial inmates are 
 defined as those individuals who are legally detained, but for whom the Bureau of Prisons has not yet 
 received notification of conviction. Ordinarily, pretrial inmates will be separated, to the extent possible, 
 from convicted inmates. The purpose of this supplement is to establish the procedures and operations, 
 as well as staff responsibilities, for the operation of the institution, as it relates to pretrial inmates. It is 
 paramount this supplement is read in conjunction with the program statement as information stated in 
 national policy is not reiterated within. 
 H. DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: 
 a. Directives Rescinded: I.S. 7331.04d, Pretrial Inmates, dated June 25, 2009. 
 b. Directives Referenced: P.S. 7331.04, Pretrial Inmates, dated January 31, 2003. 
 III. PROCEDURES: MCC New York provides the care, custody. and control of inmates for the USM 
 Service, while they are in pretrial status. However, all pretrial inmates remain the responsibility of the 
 U.S. Marshal Service until they arc convicted by the Court. In addition to pretrial inmates, MCC New 
 York also confines sentenced inmates and holdovers. Additionally, MCC New York houses inmates on 
 writs to the local district courts who have already been sentenced in other federal or state courts. 
 Although pretrial inmates are ideally separated from convicted inmates, it is not always possible or 
 practical to keep all pretrial inmates separate from those who have been convicted. Due to the unique 
 design, structure, and operation of MCC New York, staff may. based upon sound correctional judgment, 
 permit pretrial inmates, who do not present a risk to the security or orderly running of the institution, to 
 have regular contact with convicted inmates. Therefore, pretrial inmates at this facility may be housed 
 with convicted inmates, provided a waiver is signed. However, it is essential that pretrial inmates be 
 separated from sentenced inmates before and during the intake screening process.

 A. Procedures for Admission: The following procedures shall be followed when processing all 
 new commitments, to include the verification of commitment papers, and searches of inmates 
 and property. 
 1. Inmates entering the Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area will be identified by 
 Correctional Systems (CS)staff, formerly Inmate Systems Management (ISM) staff via an 
 interview with the remanding official and the inmate. CS staff will review the Prisoner 
 Remand (BP377) for accurate and complete information. All legal documents delivered 
 with the inmate will be verified. 
 2. All inmates will walk through a metal-weapon detector, be pat searched, and visually 
 searched; a hand-held metal detector may also be used. All inmate property will be 
 searched. 
 3. Prior to being escorted to their assigned housing units, all new commitments will receive 
 two jumpsuits, two pair of socks, two pair of underwear, one ditty bag {a toothbrush, 
 toothpaste, a comb, and shaving cream), one pair of tennis deck shoes, and one institution 
 bedroll {two blankets, two sheets, one pillow case, one towel, and one washcloth). 
 Female pretrial inmates receive two pair of pants and shirts, versus jumpsuits, and two 
 bras. 
 B. Intake Screening (Social Interview): Due to the lack of available information concerning 
 pretrial inmates, it is imperative a thorough intake screening is completed on all new 
 commitments. Unit team staff will conduct intake screening on all inmates committed to the 
 institution between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday. If members of the 
 Unit Team are not available, a Lieutenant will conduct the intake screening. All staff members 
 conducting intake screening must be CIM certified. 
 1. Staff conducting intake screening for new commitments will receive a SENTRY generated 
 Intake Screening form (BP-64) from R&D staff once the inmate has been loaded into 
 SENTRY. Staff must pay special attention to the CMC Clearance and Separatee Data 
 printout attached to the Intake Screening form. If SENTRY is not operational, staff should 
 utilize the manual Intake Screening form (BP-312) {Attachment A). If possible, the staff 
 member conducting the intake screening should obtain pertinent information from the 
 Deputy U. S. Marshal, or arresting agent, committing the inmate. Staff conducting the 
 intake screening must review the U.S. Marshals Remand to Custody form to determine the 
 offense with which the inmate is being charged. The interviewer should notate if the 
 inmate is charged with a sophisticated crime, such as, Racketeering or Engaging in a 
 Continuing Criminal Enterprise, or a violent offense such as, Murder, Bank Robbery, or

 Extortion. The staff member conducting the interview will document any security 
 concerns on the Intake Screening form. Staff will also assess the inmate's physical and 
 mental condition, and document his/her conclusions on the Intake Screening form. If a 
 psychological condition is noted, screening staff must notify the Duty Psychologist 
 immediately of any noted mental concerns inmate. If on a weekend, the screening staff 
 must call the on call Duty Psychologist to interview the inmate. If available, the staff 
 member conducting the screening must review the Pre-Sentence Report and the Central 
 File. The staff member's review of this material shall be documented on the Intake 
 Screening form. Finally, the staff member conducting the interview will determine if the 
 inmate can be placed in the general population of this institution. If the inmate's placement 
 in general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of the 
 institution, the Operations Lieutenant should be notified in order for the inmate to be placed 
 in Administrative Detention. The conclusion that the inmate warrants placement in 
 Administrative Detention should be documented directly on the Intake Screening form. 
 This form must be signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening. When 
 intake screening court returns, the supplement on Intake Screening must be reviewed. A 
 separate questionnaire will be completed which addresses all questions on the SENTRY 
 generated form. All intake screening must occur in the privacy of a room with only the 
 inmate being intake screened and staff. If a notorious pretrial inmate, an inmate whose 
 presence could attract undue attention to the Bureau of Prisons, or an inmate who requires a 
 higher degree of security based on a serious volatile background or violent crime is 
 committed, the intake screener will make copies of (Inmate Alert Notice) for the 
 Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist (SCSS), CMC, SIS Office, the Lieutenant's 
 Office and the Captain. The Captain will then notify the Warden and Executive staff 
 2. The staff member conducting the intake screening will ensure the intake screening form is 
 Filled out completely and correctly, to include all times and dates. The staff member 
 conducting the intake screening must also ensure the following forms are completed: 
 a. Pretrial Inmate Notice of Separation/Work Waiver, BP-S203.073: Staff will 
 ensure Section II of this form is completed for each new pretrial inmate. If a 
 pretrial inmate refuses to sign this form, staff will document this fact and any 
 reasons the inmate provides for refusing to sign on the form. Each new pretrial 
 inmate should also be asked to complete Section IV of this form, the work waiver 
 section. If a pretrial inmate does not wish to volunteer for a work assignment, 
 this fact should also be documented on the form. 
 If an inmate's ability to comprehend this waiver appears questionable, a referral to 
 Psychology Services will be made for determination of competency.

 b. Pretrial Inmate Interview, BP-S562.073: This form must be completed in 
 conjunction with the Intake Screening Form. It is essential a thorough review of 
 the inmate's status be completed upon his/her commitment. This form must be 
 completed and signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening 
 interview. 
 c. Acknowledgment of Inmates (BP407 and 408): Staff must either have each 
 inmate read or read to each inmate the policies/procedures on these forms; staff 
 must cross off the method of advisement not used. Staff must ensure these forms 
 are completed in their entirety. 
 3. The intake screener is also responsible for distributing the "Inmate Rights and 
 Responsibilities" to all new commitments. The intake screener will ensure each inmate 
 acknowledges his/her receipt of the rights and responsibilities by circling the appropriate 
 response on the Intake Screening form and signing it. If an inmate refuses to sign the 
 BP -64 to acknowledge receipt of the rights and responsibilities, staff shall document this 
 fact on the form. The completed BP-64 shall be filed in the inmate's unit management 
 fi le, hereinafter called the drop file. 
 4. CS staff are responsible for reviewing the U.S. Marshals receipt to review the status of 
 those inmates returning from court each day. If an inmate's pretrial status changes, ISM 
 staff will make the necessary changes in SENTRY. ISM staff is also responsible for 
 interviewing the escorting Deputy U.S. Marshal to determine if any unusual 
 circumstances occurred in court which could affect an inmate's classification at this 
 institution. 
 5. All new commitments will be issued the pamphlet entitled "Sexual Abuse/Assault 
 Prevention and Intervention." 
 C. Medical Intake Screening and Procedures: 
 1. All new commitments are examined by a physician's assistant. The physician's assistant 
 will screen all inmates in accordance with BOP medical procedures to determine if there 
 are any reasons for not placing the inmate in general population, or for restricting work 
 assignments. Specific attention shall be given to evidence of depression and potential 
 suicide, and whether the inmates are victims of recent sexual assaults during a period of 
 incarceration. A copy of the completed Intake Screening Medical form (BP-354) will be 
 placed in the inmate's file maintained in Correctional Systems. All pretrial inmates will 
 receive a complete medical screening within fourteen days of their arrival at this facility.

 2. The Health Services Department will conduct sick call, triage, and physical exams for 
 each housing unit Monday through Friday. Medical emergencies are handled 
 immediately. 
 3. Medical staff is on duty seven days a week, in the event of a medical emergency. Pretrial 
 inmates receive the same level of basic medical care, including dental care, provided to 
 sentenced inmates. The decision to defer or deny elective medical procedures shall be 
 based on the same policies or guidelines which apply to sentenced inmates. The 
 transient nature of pretrial inmates often precludes many elective procedures. 
 Emergency medical treatment is provided in accordance with local procedures, for both 
 pretrial and sentenced inmates. The Unit Manager is responsible for preparing a letter 
 from the Warden to the Judge, through the U.S. Marshal, to notify the Court of any 
 inmate receiving any psychiatric medication and/or any other medication that may alter 
 the inmates courtroom behavior. It has been established locally that the medications 
 which fall under the realm of "psychiatric medication which may affect courtroom 
 behavior" are anti-psychotic, anti-manic, and on occasion, anti-depressants medications. 
 The Pharmacist is responsible for providing the respective Unit Manager a list of inmates 
 prescribed either anti-psychotic or anti-manic medication on a daily basis. The 
 Psychiatrist will provide the Unit Manager with a list of inmates prescribed 
 anti -depressants when he believes the medication "may affect courtroom behavior." 
 (See Attachment B). A copy of this letter will be sent to the Assistant United States 
 Attorney (AUSA), the USM, and the inmate's attorney, via the AUSA. A copy of this 
 letter will also be put in the inmate's medical file and forwarded to Psychology. These 
 same procedures apply to inmates committed for 4241(a) and 4242 psychological studies. 
 D. Housing: Pretrial inmates, who are appropriate for general population, are placed in one of the 
 seven general population housing units; six male units and one female unit. Five male housing 
 units contain secure two-man rooms; four units have a capacity of housing 96 inmates; one unit 
 has the capacity to house 94 inmates. There is one male dormitory unit which has the capacity 
 of housing 156 inmates. The female unit houses 79 inmates and housing style varies from two 
 to six woman rooms. 
 1. Unit Assignment: Due to the unique nature and structure of this facility, the MCC has the 
 capability of housing inmates who must be separated from one another. Therefore, as long 
 as an inmate does not present any unusual security or medical concerns which would require 
 his/her placement in Administrative Detention, pretrial inmates will be assigned housing 
 units in general population using their separation needs as the primary factor. The officer 
 assigned to the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Office is responsible for ensuring that 
 inmates are initially placed in the appropriate housing units. This decision will be based 
 upon accessing SENTRY and determining the inmate's separation needs; and also 
 information provided by unit staff, ISM staff, or a Lieutenant.

 MCC New York's unique design and mission require that many activities are provided on 
 the units (i.e., meal serving, pill line, recreation); the units are partially self-sufficient 
 requiring movement off the unit only for purposes of medical care, outdoor recreation, 
 law library, some educational classes, movement to court, and attorney meetings. 
 2. Procedures: Unit Managers are responsible for the operations within their housing units, 
 to include sanitation, clothing, property, feeding, recreation, etc. Ordinarily, Unit 
 Managers may change an inmate's quarters assignment for valid reasons. Unit staff must 
 review an inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data before moving an inmate. Prior 
 to moving an inmate classified as a disruptive group member or in the posted picture file, 
 the Unit Manager must confer with the SIS Office to ensure there exists no other security 
 reason preventing the move. To avoid sensitive information being brought onto the 
 units, the Unit Managers can confer with the CMC who has SENTRY access to Security 
 Threat Group (STG) information. Also, the Unit Manager must consult with the C&A 
 Officer before making the move to ensure the institutional count is not disrupted and for 
 further review of the inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data. 
 3. High Security Cases: Those inmates identified as requiring a greater degree of security 
 and control, but who do not require placement in the Special Housing Unit, are to be 
 placed on higher floors for increased security. Pretrial inmates whose presence in the 
 general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of the institution 
 will be housed in administrative detention in the Special Housing Unit. 
 E. Admission and Orientation (A&O): An Institutional A&O Program for pretrial inmates is not 
 required. Based on the extreme population pressures, unique needs to separate inmates by floor 
 and constant movement, inmates identified in this section will not be required to receive 
 institution and unit A & O, however, upon intake screening they will receive the following: 
 1. Inmate Rights and Responsibilities (located in the A & O Handbook) 
 2. Bureau Prohibited Acts and Disciplinary System (located in the A & O Handbook) 
 3. Completion of the Inmate Acknowledgment Forms (BP-S407/408) 
 A&O Handbooks are posted on all general population units in English and Spanish. All new 
 commitments housed in the Special Housing Unit receive a copy of the handbook. 
 F. Visiting: Immediate family members and one person of "meaning" will be placed on the visiting 
 list absent strong circumstances that preclude visiting. Immediate family is defined as mother, 
 father, step-parents, step-children, foster parents, grand-children, brothers, sisters, spouse and 
 children. As the situation presents itself, other non-immediate family members will be allowed 
 to visit at the approval of the Associate Warden of Programs (AWP). Further, in circumstances, 
 when an inmate requests more than ten visitors to be placed on their visiting list, the Unit 
 Manager will approve / deny any visitor exceeding the limit. Pretrial inmates may complete a

 visiting list for immediate family members as soon as they reach their assigned housing unit. 
 Pretrial inmates have the opportunity for social visits once a week. Ordinarily, each social visit 
 will last a maximum of one hour, the exception to this policy being when a visitor traveled more 
 than three hours. Visiting hours for pretrial inmates are from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 
 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Monday thru Friday. The visiting day for each unit remains the same, 
 yet the times change every other week to enable visitors to come in the afternoon and the 
 evening. 
 G. Pretrial Inmate Reviews: The Unit Manager is responsible for scheduling and documenting 
 pretrial inmate reviews for all pretrial inmates assigned to his/her unit. Each pretrial inmate 
 committed to this institution will be scheduled for a review within 21 days of admission. 
 Subsequent reviews will be conducted every 90 days. It is the responsibility of the Case 
 Manager and the Counselor to obtain the necessary information in order to hold a meaningful 
 review. The Pretrial Inmate Review Report (BP-S561.073) shall be used to document these 
 reviews. If an inmate refuses to attend a scheduled review, staff shall document the refusal, and if 
 known, the reason. The emphasis of this review will be placed on the inmate's current legal 
 proceedings, institutional adjustment, work/sanitation evaluations, and program recommendation 
 based on needs and availability. The unit team should also review the inmate's CIM status, and 
 document the review in the file (i.e. on team sheet, activity record in FOI Exempt section). Unit 
 staff should also verify the accuracy of all load data and update Sentry as needed. A pretrial 
 inmate review must have at a minimum, two Unit Staff in attendance. A docket containing the 
 names of general population inmates scheduled for review should be posted in the multipurpose 
 area of the unit at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled review. 
 The Unit Manager is also responsible for monitoring the inmate's pretrial status. Once an 
 inmate pleads guilty/is convicted, the inmate's Admission/Release status should be updated by 
 CS to reflect holdover status rather than pretrial status. These inmates are no longer considered 
 to be pretrial inmates. Once the inmate changes to A-HLD status, conducting a team is no longer 
 necessary. However, the Case Manager shall ensure that monitoring of these cases are 
 conducted informally through an informal interview documented on the Activity Log. Unit staff 
 must carefully monitor the status of the cases of those inmates who have been identified as 
 requiring a greater degree of security and control, or those inmates involved in high profile cases. 
 All pretrial inmates are normally classified as IN custody. Ordinarily, there should be no reason 
 to consider changing a pretrial inmate's custody. Changes in the custody levels of pretrial 
 inmates should only occur in rare cases. If unusual circumstances occur, the unit team must 
 refer a recommendation to increase an inmate's custody from IN to MAXIMUM to the Warden 
 for approval. The Regional Director must approve a reduction of a pretrial inmate's custody 
 from IN to a lower custody level.

 H. File Accountability: Unit Management inmate files will be maintained in the CS. All files 
 must be maintained consistent with the Program Statement and supplement pertaining to central 
 files. All files are to be counted quarterly, with a SENTRY generated roster. All files must be 
 secured at all times and no file may be left in a staff's office overnight. For specific handling 
 procedures, the supplement on central files should be referenced. 
 I. Property: Beyond those items issued by CSstaff during the admission process, section III(AX3) 
 within, further clothing is issued by the Laundry Department to balance out the amount allowed 
 by local policy. Approved clothing for pretrial inmates is listed in the institution supplement on 
 Inmate Personal Property. Other items such as bar soap, laundry detergent, additional 
 disposable razors, paper, pencils, and envelopes are distributed on each housing unit. 
 Once arraigned and remanded to custody, all personal clothing will be shipped to an address 
 provided by the inmate. Lock boxes are not used at this facility. The committing federal agents 
 of newly arrested persons who have not been arraigned are responsible for safeguarding all 
 money and valuable items until inmates are remanded to custody, at which time the inmates will 
 forward all valuables to a person identified by themselves; monies will be credited to their 
 commissary accounts. 
 A pretrial inmate may have two sets of court clothes delivered to the institution for a jury trial or 
 for sentencing. Court clothing requests must be approved by a member of the unit team 48 
 hours prior to the delivery of the clothing. Clothing exchange is Mondays, Wednesdays, 
 Thursdays, and Fridays from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., excluding holidays, in the front lobby. 
 Pretrial inmates may retain clothing items such as T-shirts, shorts, sweatshirts and sweatpants 
 purchased at other institutions. Pretrial inmates may also retain all legal work, including audio 
 tapes, pertaining to their current legal action. 
 J. Education: The Education Department provide pretrial inmates with educational opportunities 
 such as Adult Continuing Education (ACE). The Education Department maintains the 
 institution's law library. A satellite law library is also maintained in the Special Housing Unit. 
 Pretrial inmates have the opportunity to spend a reasonable amount of time to do legal research 
 and prepare legal documents in the Law Library. More specifically, to obtain certain legal 
 materials pretrial inmates may make copies of legal materials via use of the debit card system. 
 Inmates who claim indigence must obtain the Indigence Form in Education and have it approved 
 by their unit team. Inmates may check out materials by consulting with staff from the Education 
 Department. The Education Department will provide current newspapers, including Spanish 
 Newspapers, to each pretrial unit.

 K. Recreation: Pretrial inmates may participate in recreation activities from 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 
 p.m., except during official counts. Movies are shown on the units on weekends via the 
 Closed -Circuit Television System. The Recreation Department conducts outdoor recreation 
 seven days a week, and rotates the pretrial units' access to the roof on a daily basis. Pretrial 
 inmates have access to approximately five hours of outdoor recreation a week. 
 L. Legal Resources: The institution's Legal Department will coordinate and approve all legal 
 activities unique to a pretrial facility. Examples of these activities include arranging 
 co-defendant meetings, and providing inmates and defense attorneys with video tape players to 
 review video tapes. Unit staff will deliver audio tapes to those inmates who receive them from 
 their defense attorney or the U.S. Attorneys Office. Unit staff will also provide inmates with 
 tape players to review their tapes. Read-only computer CD access is available in the Education 
 Department if inmates' attorneys send legal material on CDs. Pretrial inmates may make 
 unmonitored calls to his/her attorney by submitting a request to a member of their unit team. 
 Staff will not limit a pretrial inmate's access to unmonitored legal calls, however, these calls are 
 granted to the extent that staff resources allow and must meet the requirements as stated in the 
 Program Statement Legal Activities, Inmate. All legal mail sent to pretrial inmates is opened in 
 their presence. Pretrial inmates may meet with their attorneys in the Attorney Conference Room 
 ordinarily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., each day, including weekends and holidays. Exceptions 
 to these times are made on a case by case basis. 
 M. Institutional Work Assignments: All pretrial inmates are responsible for housekeeping tasks 
 in their rooms and in the common living areas. Pretrial inmates may be assigned as unit 
 orderlies and receive performance pay. Each pretrial unit shall have no more than 12 orderly 
 positions. Pretrial inmates may also be assigned a work detail outside the confines of the unit, 
 provided the inmates do not have separatees in the building and are not a security risk. The unit 
 team will review each inmate's eligibility for a work assignment during pretrial inmate reviews. 
 A pretrial inmate does not earn extra good time. The unit team must ensure Section IV of the 
 Notice of Separation/Work Waiver form is executed prior to an inmate's assignment to any work 
 detail. Any pre-trial inmate, not on writ from a state facility, whose status changes to holdover 
 by virtue of the fact the inmate has been convicted or pled guilty, is eligible to work. This 
 policy is contingent upon the fact the inmate does not have any separatees in the building. 
 N. Community Activities: All pretrial inmates remain in the custody of the USM Service until 
 convicted by the Court, and therefore, are not eligible for community-based activities. In the 
 case of an emergency, unit staff shall facilitate contact with the pretrial inmate's attorney, who 
 may seek from the Court a decision concerning release from custody, or an escorted trip. 
 Additionally, unit staff will notify the U.S. Attorney's Office and the USM of the emergency. 
 Staff shall document contact with each of these agencies in the inmate's file. Release of the 
 inmate requires a Court Order, and an escorted trip must be approved by the Court. Ordinarily, 
 the USM Service will provide the escorts. This rule does not apply to emergency medical trips 
 to a local hospital.

 O. Religious Programs: Pretrial inmates in general population may participate in religious group 
 activities. Staff may enlist the aid of contract or volunteer personnel to assist in the ministering 
 of pretrial inmates. Due to the large number of separatees housed at this facility, any inmate 
 who appears on the institution's daily separation roster may not attend group services in the 
 Chapel located on Unit 5 North. Religious services for female inmates will be conducted in the 
 programs room of the female unit. Pretrial inmates who have separatees, and those housed in 
 the Special Housing Unit, must be ministered to individually on his/her unit. Inmates have the 
 opportunity to fill out a Religious Preference Summary during Intake Screening 
 P. Marriage: Pretrial inmates may request permission to marry in accordance with current BOP 
 policy. Unit staff shall contact the Court, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in the case of an alien, 
 the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to advise them of the marriage request of 
 the inmate and to request their comments. 
 Psychiatric and Psychological Counseling: Due to the transient nature of pretrial inmates, 
 individual counseling is limited to inmate needs, resolutions, and crisis intervention. Pretrial 
 inmates may be allowed the opportunity to receive counseling services by submitting a "Request 
 to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. Further, should inmates have any drug 
 dependency issues the 40-Hour Drug Program is available to pretrial male and female inmates 
 via submitting a "Request to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. 
 It Death or Serious Illness: In the event of death or serious illness, unit staff shall prepare letters, 
 for the Warden's signature, notifying the committing Court, the United States Attorney, the 
 inmate's attorney of record, and the designated family member or next of kin, and other agency 
 with an interest (i.e. Consulate). 
 S. Discipline: Pretrial inmates are required to abide by the Bureau of Prisons rules and 
 regulations. New commitments are provided with the inmates' rights and responsibilities. 
 Regulations pertaining to discipline - prohibited acts, types of disciplinary actions which may be 
 taken, and the disciplinary system within the institution - are posted on all units, except in the 
 Special Housing Unit, and are explicit in the Admission and Orientation Booklet. 
 The respective Unit Manager is responsible for ensuring a letter, signed by the Warden, is 
 forwarded to the Court, through the U.S. Marshal, advising the Court of any findings of guilt, for 
 serious high and greatest severity incident reports, by the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO). 
 Furthermore, if the inmate violates any of the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Prisons, a 
 letter will be sent to the United States Probation Office and prosecuting Assistant United States 
 Attorney which specifies all violations. Upon an inmate's plea of guilt/conviction, the discipline 
 history of the inmate will be reviewed by the respective Unit Manager, or designee.

 Please see the below email chain regarding the SHU attorney conference room issue. 
 »agy Cross-Goldenberg 
 Hi 
 Just to note one additional wrinkle that is easily solved: 
 7/30/2019 4:28 PM >» 
 Today, it sounds like our staff observed that Epstein's lawyers were able to hold onto the SHU room even 
 after they had met with him while they waited to meet with him again. No one else gets that privilege. If 
 a client has to be taken back to the unit, or to medical, or otherwise leave the attorney visiting area, we 
 would have to leave, too. If he needs to be taken to another location, and his attorneys want to meet 
 with him again, the facility can require them to get back in line like the rest of us. 
 Today alone we had one attorney give up after waiting in the lobby for 2.5 hours. We had another 
 attorney wait for three hours. That included a wait of an hour and fifteen minutes 'after he got to the 
 SHU room while Epstein was brought *backs to the room his lawyers had been holding and while medical 
 visited him there regarding some paperwork for his fish allergy. 
 We have attorneys who urgently need to see clients this week. We urgently need a solution. 
 Thanks, 
 Peggy

 Thanks for getting back to us, . Just a heads up that we will likely file something with Judge Rakoff 
 in Sayoc. Our attorneys have not been able to meet with him, and his sentencing is coming up. If there's 
 some alternative, please let me know.

 No worries about tomorrow. Take care of your business. I knew he didn't tell you because I was receiving 
 calls and they said they tried to reach him and he wouldn't answer. But it's ok. I'll deal with it. Yesterday 
 was a ghost town as well. said it was 13 vacant posts. Please ensure the staff in SHU make the 
 rounds or get assistance with the rounds. Maybe Activities. Not only due to Epstein but one of the 
 reasons. If any non-custody come in, please use them. I'm here if you need me. Thanks.

 Good morning Ma'am I was on staff assist all week at Danbury so I had no idea that he designated me 
 this weekend so I'm really sorry about that. I'll help out as soon as I'm done with tomorrow and 
 take care of things on Tuesday so you won't have to worry about anything. 
 FYI, we are on modified status today. Staff search, Internal, 5 south, 7 south, SHU 3 and 4, are 
 vacated. We are doing attorney visits though but we may have to cancel religious services. Enjoy your

 No worries. He designated you as the Captain this weekend and I am sure you weren't aware of it. I got 
 all the calls. He's not answering the phone so I'm sure you won't get a response. I will deal with things 
 tomorrow. both also have a lot going on. We will be fine. Thank you.

 Good afternoon all, 
 Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and 
 that his CPAP is plugged in? 
 I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, 
 so there is no recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 
 days has elapsed? 
 you,

 Good afternoon 
 Our client, Jeffrey Epstein. has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was 
 not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
 Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, 
 the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 "This writer consulted with Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein 
 has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense 
 charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news

 Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after 
 duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place 
 inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

 returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION

 1. Although having a religious preference of "UNKNOWN," inmate Johnson, Jermaine (86461-054 - 9N) came on the Jumah move 
 and made an ALL EYES ON ME grand entrance into 5N, shouting and waving his arms and hands as he walked to the Chapel, trash-
 talking with the inmates secured on multiple 5N tiers, getting many inmates worked-up & causing a lot of noise in the unit. I told him his 
 behavior was unacceptable and that I expected him to leave in a calm & quiet manner when the service was over. Then, in the middle 
 of the Muslim sermon, inmate Torres, Joshua (86521-054 - 5N) came up to the secure Chapel door and proceeded to engage in a non-
 verbal conversation through the door window with Johnson while he was seated in a chair for the Muslim service, and Johnson was 
 more than willing to engage in the charade-based conversation. As I approached the door, inmate Torres went to an unknown tier/cell. 
 I then stood near the door and a few minutes later, inmate Torres came half-way up the stairs to the Chapel trying to communicate with 
 Johnson again. I addressed the matter with them both. Torres respectfully apologized but Johnson just ran his legendary mouth, hence 
 his 30 day restriction from chapel services. 
 2. The RAC Ms. notified me on Thursday, July 18 that the Saturday volunteers 
 (= 
 were not able to 
 m
 in until they completed their training on July 29. I notified them via telephone so they would not make the trip to the institution. 
 confirmed that he plans on attending the training on July 29, and his wife is trying to make arrangements to get off work to do 
 the same. Also, I delivered memos to each housing unit and had Control announce the cancellation of the Saturday service. 
 3. After I delivered the sign-up sheets to all the units for the English Christian service on Sunday and after the 10am count cleared, 5N 
 Officer notified me that he received a drop note about a gang fight planned during the church service that day (see attached). 
 he Lts., and the Lts. notified me that they felt it best to cancel the service. I immediately notified volunteer 
 , who confirmed he would be able to come on his next scheduled Sunday to provide the Christian service on Aug. 4. I also 
 had control announce the cancellation of the Sunday service. 
 4. I added inmate Epstein to the CFSA roster, and interviewed inmate Encarnacion, adding him to the roster as well. 
 5. I escorted the Rabbi on Sunday to all units with active Jewish inmates, including 11S which was locked down.

 Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the Special 
 Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate Epstein, Jeffrey, 
 Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the 
 inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The inmate was 
 placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While 
 on watch, the inmate indicated that his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been 
 harassing him and he had informed his Attorney of this matter. 
 Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the Physician 
 Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
 He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical encounter. 
 Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on his neck. 
 Responded: "I don't know". 
 He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
 He does not look in any distress or pain. 
 Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
 circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this erythema 
 in the front with marks of friction. 
 No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
 moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies any 
 respiratory problem. 
 Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild).

 population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

 Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there again. I 
 wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs rather than keeping 
 him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that way when he is interviewed

 I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal 
 visit to see him again. 
 He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks 
 in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
 He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of 
 the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

 No worries about tomorrow. Take care of your business. I knew he didn't tell you because I was 
 receiving calls and they said they tried to reach him and he wouldn't answer. But it's ok. I'll deal 
 with it. Yesterday was a ghost town as well.. said it was 13 vacant posts. Please ensure the 
 staff in SHU make the rounds or get assistance with the rounds. Maybe Activities. Not only due 
 to Epstein but one of the reasons. If any non-custody come in, please use them. I'm here if you 
 need me. Thanks.

 Subject: Inmate Epstein, J. 76318054 - Notify Psychology ASAP when he returns from court 
 TEXT.htm 
 I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk 
 assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is 
 gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is 
 suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in 
 court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be 
 proactive. 
 "This writer consulted with Dr. , Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein 
 has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense 
 charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news 
 regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein retums from court, R&D staff as well as 
 Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after 
 duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place 
 inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment." 
 Thank you, Dr.

 I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he 
 returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION 
 unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad 
 news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
 "This writer consulted with Dr. , Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for 
 suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which 
 could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as 
 well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the 
 aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology 
 can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

 I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk 
 assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is 
 gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is 
 suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in 
 court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be 
 proactive. 
 "This writer consulted with Dr. , Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein 
 has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense 
 charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news 
 regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein retums from court, R&D staff as well as 
 Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after 
 duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place 
 inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment." 
 Thank you, Dr.

 FROM: The Office of the General Counsel, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
 Supervisory CLC Attorney EMAIL: ADDRESS: New York 
 NEW YORK NY 10007 RE: Obligation to Preserve Records and Electronically Stored 
 Information in INMATE DEATH, LHN-CIV-2019-00204 
 The BOP and its employees are required to preserve any potentially relevant 
 information pertaining to 
 EFTA00035035
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 6:30 am, EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 76318-
 054, was found unresponsive in his cell in conjunction with an apparent suicide, 
 and, subsequently, pronounced dead at the local hospital. No lawsuit has been filed 
 yet, but one is anticipated. 
 In this case, relevant information includes, but is not limited to: 
 Please preserve all electronic files (e.g. emails, Word documents, TRUSCOPE 
 entries, videos, BEMR records) and all handwritten or other physical documents 
 pertaining to inmate Epstein. 
 You have been identified as an individual likely to have information relevant to 
 this matter. Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to preserve any such 
 information in your possession, custody, or control even if it otherwise would be 
 destroyed, deleted or overwritten, in the normal course of Agency operations. 
 Knowingly altering, editing, or deleting potentially relevant information could 
 result in court-ordered sanctions against the BOP and/or employment action 
 against staff. 
 Electronically stored information (ESI) includes all information stored in any 
 digital medium, including the BOPA's computer network, any PCs, laptop computers, 
 all back-up media, email, calendars, word processing documents, scanned documents, 
 spreadsheets, photos and drafts. 
 DO NOT DISCARD OR DESTROY ANY RECORDS (ELECTRONICALLY STORED OR OTHERWISE) 
 RELATING TO THIS MATTER. 
 Action Required: 
 1. Complete the attached Custodian Document Search Checklist and return to 
 by 08/21/2019. 
 2. Preserve Relevant Information 
 a. Do not alter, edit, delete, or otherwise destroy potentially relevant 
 information in either paper or digital documents. All auto-deletion 
 functions should be turned off and any retention policy should be 
 suspended if execution would cause the loss of potentially relevant 
 information. Do not move or alter electronic documents as this will 
 modify the metadata. Should you need to work on a relevant document, 
 please save it as a new version and edit the new version. 
 b. Do not transfer any potentially relevant information to a 
 Federal Records Center (FRC) or any other location. 
 c. Notify me of any potentially relevant information that is in the 
 process of being or has been sent to an offsite storage facility 
 (FRC or any other offsite facility). 
 3. Contact me if there are any staffing changes in your office that affect 
 this matter (e.g., retirement, transfer, etc.). 
 4. If you are aware of the loss of any potentially relevant ESI, notify me 
 immediately. 
 5. This document is privileged and confidential. 
 DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE THIS NOTICE WITH ANYONE.

Good Morning: 
 I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmates meals be delivered from the 
 housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference? 
 Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every hour without 
 being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate? 
 Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other inmates who are in 
 attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch which is sent up from food service 
 every morning. 
 Please provide a response.
