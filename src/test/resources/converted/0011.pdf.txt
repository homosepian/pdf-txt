 know exactly where I was at. It was dark, and when we went through doors. We went 
 downstairs, there was also an elevator in the location. I was kept in a stall, it looked 
 like a horse stall that had short walls on the sides so you could see inside. It wasn't 
 really to keep me and the other little girls inside it was to make it where we could be 
 viewed. Epstein would walk past each girl including myself with a lot of men following 
 him, and they would judge us. He told me I was "fat and ugly". So that's what he 
 called me. , and he said ► had to pretend it was 
 him to see if I performed well. He said if I performed well I could be his girlfriend, then 
 I would be allowed to be upstairs he called it. He said the girls upstairs were pretty 
 and they were his girlfriends. He then raped me, and said 
 ► 
 was evil because I liked it. I 
 couldn't make my body stop feeling, so he said I had to go to the holding place to pray 
 hard enough to be able to be upstairs with the other girls. There were a lot of pictures 
 of girls naked all over the walls. I had to pray hard to be like them he said. The girls 
 that he said performed well enough, went with the line of all of the men and they left. 
 In Virgin Islands, I was they stopped there. I was 17 
 years old, was blindfolded and taken to an underground 
 location. It had steps that went down. I was raped by Jeffery Epstein, there were other 
 men that raped me. I was kept in a stall so that men could look at me. He said I was 
 an animal and that he was perfect, if I had sex with him that I wouldn't be such an 
 animal. . He said I wanted to be raped because I wanted to be more 
 like him.

 Dear Ms.MI 
 I am one of the attorneys for and met you in 2019. 
 Ms. and I were both away last week or I would have emailed you sooner. 
 It was brought to our attention that was called as a character witness for the defense last week. From 
 our understanding, Ms. gave a shining picture of Ms. Maxwell, and claimed that she was only at 
 Epstein's residence once in the years she worked for him. 
 According to Ms. =, however, from 2001-2002, when she was 14-15 years old, in addition to Ms. 
 would call her on the phone to schedule the sexual encounters with Mr. Epstein and would give her explicit instructions to 
 follow upon arrival. She would then see Ms. at the property after speaking to her on the phone. See 
 Attached is a screenshot of MsLinkedln profile two days prior to our filing suit against her. It was taken down 
 immediately upon our filing the lawsuit naming her. 
 Ms. dropped her lawsuit against Ms. MsMnd Ms. Maxwell, only because it was a required condition 
 of her settlement with the Epstein Estate. 
 I hope this information is useful. 
 Very truly yours, 
 Of Counsel

 Subject: [EXTERNAL] Maxwell 
 I have issued the following statement in response to multiple press inquires: 
 The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell is a welcome confirmation of the veracity of the charges brought against her on 
 behalf of the very brave young women whom she directly participated in abusing. Speaking for the women I have been 
 privileged to represent over the past decade, I thank the prosecutors of the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
 New York for their unwavering dedication to achieving justice in this case, and I express my confidence in their continued 
 dedication. 
 Satisfaction with Maxwell's conviction is tempered by the knowledge that other co-conspirators have yet to be held 
 responsible for their involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's extraordinary criminal enterprise. Doors closed by Epstein's death 
 may be opened by the very strong motivation Maxwell now has to unlock every door to which she holds a key.

 Ghislaine Maxwell. Not many people saw the sacrifices made by you guys during the last few years regarding this case, but 
 it did not go unnoticed with me. You both truly made a difference and I am sure those victims feel the same.

 Good evening-
 Regarding the list of numbers to be queried in Relativity I've completed the first 4. There are several "hits" but not all are 
 exact matches and need to be sorted through. 
 I organized the info in a Word Doc reflecting results under the first section US vs Epstein as "JE" and the second part with 
 the search warrants as "JE SW". Each positive match has the control number and a brief description of what it consists of. 
 As I continue to work on it I will send it with updated results. 
 Thanks,

 Hi 
 Hope you're doing well. Do you have up-to-date copies of the tracking spreadsheets for the tipline/hotlines for Maxwell 
 and Epstein that you could please send to me as soon as possible? I think the last ones we have from FBI are from last 
 summer (one of which is attached) so just want to do extra due diligence on my end to make sure we have what we need 
 to produce in 3500. If you could send those spreadsheets as soon as possible, that would be great. 
 Thank you,

 Hey ME 
 and would like the emails for the SDNY leads in the updated Maxwell hotline spreadsheet. I've made a USAfx 
 folder for them to be uploaded to, since it's probably too many to send via email: 
 If you could please help us get these together as soon as possible, that would be really helpful. 
 Thanks again,

 Hi 
 I hope you're all well! I just added you to a "Maxwell Amazon Records" folder on USAfx, linked here: 
 https://usafx.box.com/s/xwzacvolpqw1929zi5b0q9lxkg9e0zh4
 I uploaded two zip files — one entitled "Original Returns" and one entitled "SDNY_GM_00000966-976 (Amazon)". The 
 original returns are the returns in their original format as we received them, and the SDNY folder contains the converted 
 and Bates stamped versions of those original files. They are identical, but I uploaded them (a) for your reference and (b) 
 because the Bates stamped versions are not password protected, making them easier to quickly review. 
 Thanks very much! If you have any issues, please let me know.

 Been a while, so I hope you're well these days! I wanted to send a quick email because our office is nominating the 
 Epstein / Maxwell case for a Director's Award in the category of Superior Performance by a Litigation Team. Doing a 
 nomination for that award in particular allows the office to include law enforcement partners as well, so we're thrilled to 
 have the full team in the application, including in recognition of your extensive efforts with victims. I've reached out to

 • DOB 
 • Last four of SSN 
 • Your GS scale 
 • Whether you've won any DOJ or other professional awards in the past three years 
 That's all! I'm reachable anytime at this email or by phone at . If it's possible to chat today, that would be 
 great, or if not then whenever you're able.

 The following transaction was entered on 4/29/2022 at 4:54 PM EDT and filed on 4/29/2022 
 Case Name: USA v. Maxwell 
 Case Number: 1:20-cr-00330-AJN 
 Filer: 
 Document Number:657 
 Docket Text: 
 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... V. Conclusion. 
 For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29 motion because the jury's 
 guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence presented 
 at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based on constructive amendment or 
 EFTA00038962
variance because the jury instructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all 
 captured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not 
 prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally 
 delayed its prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies 
 the Defendant's motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the 
 Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is 
 multiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is 
 multiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the 
 Defendant's participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's 
 continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. 
 Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The 
 Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. The Court previously set a 
 schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. 
 No. 599. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/29/2022)(bw)

 Hey -- in the spirit of closure (!), any luck on the concurrence form? I have from NYPD, so now that 
 sentencing is done I think the office will submit as soon as possible (it's due Friday, but I think because of the upcoming 
 holiday weekend they'd love to submit today or tomorrow). Thanks!

 Dear 
 Been a while, so I hope you're well these days! I wanted to send a quick email because our office is nominating the 
 Epstein / Maxwell case for a Director's Award in the category of Superior Performance by a Litigation Team. Doing a 
 nomination for that award in particular allows the office to include law enforcement partners as well, so we're thrilled to 
 have the full team in the application, including in recognition of your extensive efforts with victims. I've reached out to 
 and M, and so also wanted to ask you if you could please either email, or give me a quick call to tell me, your: 
 • DOB 
 EFTA00038968
• Last four of SSN 
 • Your GS scale 
 • Whether you've won any DOJ or other professional awards in the past three years 
 That's all! I'm reachable anytime at this email or by phone at . If it's possible to chat today, that would be 
 great, or if not then whenever you're able. 
 thanks again,

 HIM, 
 It's been a while and seems like things on this case worked out where some of the people who should be locked 
 up are locked up. 
 I'm wondering if you know of a way I could ever talk to Ghislaine who's in prison. I have questions and words, 
 and while don't assume there'd be closure for me in asking her these questions and talking to her, I'm hoping it 
 might do something in my heart at least. 
 Do you know if or how these things would even work if possible in the first place? 
 I don't have the spare cash or time to fly to NY, but even if I did, is that how one would go about talking to 
 someone like that in prison? So so out of my wheelhouse of things I'd ever considered even thinking about... 
 I apologize for not testifying. I was afraid and didn't want my name more associated with them than it was, and 
 I'd spent a long time trying to distance myself from it all...not that that works fully but it was what I was capable 
 of at the time. Still. I'm sorry. 
 Thanks,

 Dear Special Agent 
 As you have apparently heard from AUSA =I, we represent one of the two co-executors of the 
 Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. Hughes Hubbard & Reed represents the other. Recently, we have been responding to 
 requests/demands for documents in connection with a settlement that the Estate entered into with the 
 Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands and in response to subpoenas issued in litigations pending before the 
 U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Estate is not a party to the SDNY litigation.

submitted to the SDNY Court (Judge Jed Rakoff), who signed the "Order regarding Review of

 Dear Special Agent =I 
 As you have apparently heard from AUSA =I, we represent one of the two co-executors of the 
 Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. Hughes Hubbard & Reed represents the other. Recently, we have been responding to 
 requests/demands for documents in connection with a settlement that the Estate entered into with the 
 Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands and in response to subpoenas issued in litigations pending before the U.S. 
 District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Estate is not a party to the SDNY litigation.

 I attached the sheet that went over with you with CART numbers. I can't match up all the numbers with I B numbers-
 some of the cart numbers for the island I don't even have so I'm not sure where the mix up is. Are you able to identify what

 Dear Special Agent Young, 
 EFTA00039017
As you have apparently heard from AUSA =I, we represent one of the two co-executors of the 
 Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. Hughes Hubbard & Reed represents the other. Recently, we have been responding to 
 requests/demands for documents in connection with a settlement that the Estate entered into with the 
 Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands and in response to subpoenas issued in litigations pending before the 
 U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Estate is not a party to the SDNY litigation. 
 As part of the Estate's document production obligations, we are reviewing approximately 1,100 videos that 
 were pulled from Epstein's emails and other files. Because of the potential existence of child pornography in 
 those videos, we worked out a protocol with the parties to whom we owed document production obligations, 
 and that protocol gave our reviewers protection and comfort in undertaking the review. The protocol was 
 submitted to the SDNY Court (Judge Jed Rakoff), who signed the "Order regarding Review of 
 Videomaterials." (Attached). 
 During the review yesterday, our co-counsel at Hughes Hubbard came across a video that may contain child 
 pornography. Apparently the relevant video was shared with Epstein by an individual who was convicted of a 
 child pornography-type offense and it .ac one or two topless women. In an abundance of caution, we 
 halted the review and reached out to . Co-counsel at Hughes Hubbard (Dan Weiner and Hilary 
 McDonnell) can correct any misstatements in my description of the review since I heard the account 
 secondhand. 
 We would appreciate any guidance that you may have. We have been careful not to download videos to the 
 respective law firms' servers, but the videos were processed (without review) by a document collection vendor. 
 Thanks and we look forward to hearing from you. 
 Best,

 I wanted to reach out about traveling internationally. and I, along with 2 AUSAs from SDNY were hoping to travel to 
 back in March to interview an important witness in the Epstein/Maxwell investigation, but due to Covid that was 
 not possible. We spoke with her briefly today via video and she is not comfortable talking at length unless it is in person. 
 What is the possibility of getting approval to travel within the next month or so? Separately, I understand we would also 
 have to get IOD approval?

 Dear Ms. =, 
 I hope you are doing well. Apologies if this is the incorrect email for information related to the Epstein/Maxwell 
 cases and I would appreciate it if it could be forwarded to the appropriate federal prosecutor. 
 Like many Americans, I have been intri ued b the E stein/Maxwell web of cruelty. I noticed a name on one 
 Epstein flight log -- th I had read travel blog years before, and 
 when I went back to check, mentioned Epstein, and Maxwell by name in an account of sex 
 trafficking to and from New York, Palm Beach and in 2011. 
 That passage from July 2011 is here, on Ms. website

Verizon 5:56 PM V 87% =I 
 a fast growing number of men in a slow rebellion revoluti0n 
 whom are fed up with the perfect young gid without the brains 
 and experience that prefer the older women. whom are much 
 more fun to be around. not so boring as their younger sisters 
 and are more healthy conscious and looking after themselves. 
 better company and influence for what a man's aging bodies 
 need. Great! I have something to look (onward to. I am 
 appalled that it is the magazine editors. and moguls. such as 
 an example represented by meryf sheep in The Devil Wears 
 Prada, and the ekes of Anna Wintour, Emanuele All whom 
 are much older themselves. although fearfully good at their 
 jobs and brilliant but cannot have the power to put fourth their 
 vision because she dreads that the men financing everything 
 will make her loose her job and replace her to someone who 
 wdl jump at their request Hence wo still live in a man's world. 
 Anyway, back to the dream job that could have launched the 
 beginning of a career f0r me. I was with Ford models. I was 
 sent to a casting in NowYork, but organized through someone 
 from my agency in Milano. I was to see the man who owned 
 and was the financier of Victoria's Secret, La Senza. Pink, etc. 
 of the Limited brands. Bost mato with the CEO and founder, 
 Mr 
 n
 I was met by a very sweet and kind Ghislaine Maxwell, that I 
 later came to know was the daughter of the mysteriously 
 deceased media titan, whom looked al my photo portofolio 
 and confirmed the casting with the LTD people. 
 I saw two people and the meeting wont very well. 
 Subsequently I came back to where season in 
 was about to start and awaited me. I was chosen 
 to be the next Victoria Secret model. I was 0own back to New 
 York. no strings attached and put in my very own apartment 
 fa a few days in Manhattan and flown on a private jet to Palm 
 Beach whom I was going to meet the photographer. 
 EFTA00038038
(1 Verizon5:57 PM 87% 
 I was told that I had a better body than the top models already 
 in the campaign, that they had cellulite and drooping breasts. 
 w.de hips. etc. that I, at least wouldn't have to be airboushed 
 and photoshopped as much and would be better for the 
 catwalks as one of the angels. Also. I got involved with 
 intellectual conversations with the man in charge and he was 
 very impressed, asking me why would I want to do modeling 
 after he saw my art and dancing and that he mvrcy,c.; 
 people, why didnt I come live in N.V. and study at Julliard' 
 Anyway. Just before the models arrived. I was made an 
 advance/ a pass. I. being very naive. didnt know how those 
 industries worked. and reacted very badly and offended and 
 because I didn't return the sudden 'affection'. the very next 
 day I was on a flight back to 
 That incident put me oft the modeling world and the whoSe 
 entertainment industry so badly, that I stopped modeimg for 
 two years. In my prime. (however I have been told I look 
 better now than then, and am known as 'the body in the South 
 african mode: ing industry). It reassured what I had heard and 
 feared 
 I thought I could not tell my story to anyone. Who would 
 believe me? That is until a few years later I heard of a 
 documentary about a BBC reporter that went undercover as a 
 top photographer to Milano and exposed the industry there. 
 How much abuse of power goes on. 
 I am not saying that every top or super model had to go 
 through sleeping with someone to get that job. But it does 
 leave me wondering what most had to do to reach where they 
 are now. 
 And as for the man who recruited Victoria Secret models. has 
 'scanty been exposed and jailed for sleeping with under aged 
 girls and is dragging prince Andrew's name down with him.

 I hope that is helpful and helps establish more of the horrid sex trafficking map Maxwell and Epstein 
 established.

 him up when he arrives. We usually will get approximately 24 hours' notice when he flies back into the country. In the

 <my:Synopsis_of_Case>In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 
 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, 
 ages 14 to 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the 
 victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially recruited to 
 perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to 
 perform the "massages" nude or partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate 
 while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with 
 his hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit 
 additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-recruiter in 
 cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in 
 New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who 
 worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
 On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) 
 and 18 USC 371. The indictment is sealed. An arrest warrant has been issued 
 out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, 
 New York, New York will be sworn out the day of arrest. </-

 Hey 
 • 
 Are you in the office today? I wanted to check in about the message pad scans; I know that they are rather large. 
 I want to get them down drafted and on a disc or hard drive to get over to the AUSA's office before we proffer a 
 witness next week. 
 Also, do you have an estimate of the entire size of all that you scanned so I have a better idea of what device 
 SDNY will need to store everything? 
 Can you email me or give me a callwhen you have a chance. 
 Thanks,

FBI DEADLY FORCE POLICY 
 Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, 
 that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent 
 danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person. 
 A. Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect. 
 B. Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles. 
 C. If feasible, and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal 
 warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force. 
 D. Warning shots are not permitted. 
 E. Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects, 
 which must be used when the use of deadly force is not authorized by this policy. 
 This policy is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
 enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other 
 entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

 6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
 In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
 recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
 partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
 hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
 recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
 contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
 On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. The indictment is sealed. An arrest 
 warrant has been issued out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York will be 
 sworn out the day of arrest.

 advance. In the event that Epstein returns to Teterboro Airport, CBP will detain him at the airport. Agents and NYPD detectives 
 will coordinate with FBI Newark and CBP, then respond to effect the arrest of Epstein. 
 Once Epstein is in custody, a search warrant for his premises in New York will be sworn out. Agents and NYPD detectives will

 Just looping you in - thinks that these files can't really be opened. Instead, the name of each zip file seems to point 
 to a specific location hit, and what's inside each zip file seems to be the metadata of that hit. 
 Do you happen to know the agent who provided these files? It might be best for us to reach out to them directly to 
 confirm this, and possibly have them compile the data in a spreadsheet (or something like that) instead of thousands of 
 individual zip files. 
 Thanks so much!

 Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - Epstein again 
 < 
 Yesterday Capucci reposted the Epstein interview I did from May: 
 In May, Prof Alan Dershowitz told me that he was calling on Harvard to further investigate him, so that he would be 
 exonerated completely of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In a follow-up to the letter to President Bacow at 
 Harvard, I asked his office recently whether they have any status update on that investigation Prof Dershowitz mentioned 
 to me. It's a good question. 
 You may have seen that Scott Bergerson (Ghislaine Maxwell's reputed husband) resigned from his tech startup. That leads 
 me to believe the Maxwell deposition is likely to be unsealed. It will be interesting to see what's in there--among other 
 things, perhaps more insight into the activities of various faculty members and administrators at MIT and Harvard. We'll 
 see. 
 If you wouldn't mind, do tell any of your colleagues who may be interested in the interview about it.

 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
 In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
 • NYC024363 
 • NYC024394 
 • NYC024326 
 • NYC024368 
 • NYC024390 
 • NYC024334 
 • NYC027910 
 • NYC024323 
 • NYC024355 
 • NYC027908 
 Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
 teams. 
 Thanks very much,

Hope you're well and had a nice weekend! I am writing to confirm which devices had responsive materials (and how many 
 responsive materials were on each device) for the Maxwell photo/video responsiveness review. 
 The drive which you gave me on Friday contains five folders, one for each of the following devices (NYC024323, 
 NYC024326, NYC024355, NYC024368, NYC027910), each of which contains confidential material. Can you please let us 
 know how many highly confidential images and video files were identified for these devices? 
 Additionally, can you please let us know whether the following devices (NYC024334, NYC027908, NYC024394) had any 
 responsive material on them or not? These are devices that were initially assigned to the FBI to review but were not 
 included on the hard drive given to us on Friday. If these devices do have responsive confidential material on them, we 
 need to get that material from you ASAP, please. 
 Finally, the device highlighted below (NYC024363) is the one we spoke about last week which you said would not be ready 
 on Friday to provide us with the responsive materials. Please let us know when this is done and how we can best get 
 these materials from you. 
 In sum, we need you to please confirm the contents of all of the cells below marked with an "x" at your earliest 
 convenience. Let us know if you have any questions.

 Following up on my conversation with this morning about several discovery items that are outstanding, I wanted 
 to send I list of the outstanding items for discovery. I know you're aware of these and working on them, but I wanted to 
 make it easier for us all to keep track of what's outstanding. If you could please send us an email at the end of today 
 letting us know where we are on these, it would be extremely helpful: 
 1. Locating six images of child pornography in the Florida boxes. Located. They're black and white scans of images. 
 2. Putting us in touch with I contact at FBI who can help us discuss converting the grand jury audio to I readable 
 format. Another agent will be looking at this tomorrow 
 3. Putting us in touch with I contact at FBI who can help us discuss getting I version of the GPS/1D data from 
 Maxwell's phone in I readable format. The data we have is unreadable. I figured out the problem. You received 
 the raw data which is why it is unreadable. My apologies. I'll have the viewable data tomorrow for you. It is the 
 IP data from the pen. 
 4. Putting us in touch with the agents who are conducting the responsiveness review of the images, so that we can 
 have I brief call with them to discuss the protocol. 
 5. Doing I final sweep of media in the files, so we can make absolutely sure we've reviewed everything. I'm going 
 through the boxes/files to find any additional media. 
 When we talk at 3 today, please let us know if you have any questions about these items, happy to discuss.

 All 
 Squad C-20 is requesting the assistance of two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 
 volunteers to help out on Friday 11/13 from 9:00 am - 3:00 pm. You would have to show some discovery to 
 Maxwell and her defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would be shown to 
 them. 
 If you are able to assist, please reach out to SA ( she is cc'd)

 A few small follow-up items: 
 • For the trip to =, I'm going to confirm our meeting with at 9:30 on October 11th in =, but 
 let me know before I do if there are any issues with that timing. 
 That should be fine for me. She is the only interview? I just need to get back to NYC that night; so 9:30 
 interview should be good. 
 • For the photo(s) ofhat were seized during search warrants, could you please pull them from evidence to 
 check if there are dates on the photos? 
 Yes we can pull them. May take a few days to pull out of storage. Will let you know. 
 • I think you mentioned an analyst was looking at flight records. If it would be possible to get a summary analysis of 
 Maxwell's flights, as well as (noting any overlap), that would be great. If possible, it would be great to 
 have a rough summary sometime in the next week or so, but let us know what timeline is feasible. 
 I've asked to help with this. We will take a look at this and see the overlap. Keep in mind this is 
 only international flights. Manifests that we may have from the previous case for Epstein's flights may not 
 go back to the 90's. Make take a few days to pull; but we will let you know when we have it. 
 • On VNS stuff, could you please double check that 
 are all in VNS? 
 They should all be in minus, but I will double check on all to make sure. 
 • FYI, we've reached out to who told us he would send us the emails mentioned. We'll pass 
 those along when we get them. 
 That's great. Thank you. 
 • We'll add you to the calendar invitation for the meeting with attorney, whenever that is rescheduled. Our 
 meeting with attorneys is scheduled for October 8111 at 10 a.m., and you're welcome to join us for 
 that. 
 Thank you; that would be great. I'd be interested in hearing what they have to say.

I don't know what they look like now. 
 24. Specific to Mr. Epstein: when, how, and where did you meet him? Did he have 
 other men or women with him and were you forced to have sex with him and the 
 others? I was brought to him by my traffickers . He then 
 trafficked me for sex with the men he had with him. 
 25. What type of sexual intercourse did Mr. Epstein have with you? How often? Was he 
 physically violent? Did he attempt to photograph or video the sexual activity? I was 
 raped by Jeffery Epstein. Multiple times. He was threatening to kill and harm other 
 children if I didn't do what he said. He had video cameras he said, and if I didn't do 
 what he said they would see that I caused the other children to get hurt. Then I would 
 be put in jail. 
 26. Did Mr. Epstein have any physical features you can recall that would be 
 identifiable only to him? (moles, scars, tattoos,) not that I remember 
 27. Did Mr. Epstein call you any certain names or refer to you by name? (i.e., sweetie, 
 honey, baby) fat and ugly. He called some of the children that he chose to go places 
 with him "his girlfriend". 
 28. Have you been arrested in the U.S.? If yes, on what charge, prosecuted? no 
 29. Are you employed? (We will not contact your employer unless we cannot locate 
 you for further contact.) 
 30. Are you willing to take a polygraph administered by a federal agency? yes 
 While certain federal crimes carry a five-year limitation on prosecution, there does not exist 
 a statute of limitation on Human Trafficking within 18 US 1591. Please note that while these 
 questions are invasive, they are necessary and there may be follow-up questions as well. 
 When responding to the above questions, please print or type.

 Hope you're well and had a nice weekend! I am writing to confirm which devices had responsive materials (and how many 
 responsive materials were on each device) for the Maxwell photo/video responsiveness review. 
 The drive which you gave me on Friday contains five folders, one for each of the following devices (NYCO24323, 
 NYCO24326, NYCO24355, NYCO24368, NYCO27910), each of which contains confidential material. Can you please let us 
 know how many highly confidential images and video files were identified for these devices? 
 Additionally, can you please let us know whether the following devices (NYCO24334, NYCO27908, NYCO24394) had any 
 responsive material on them or not? These are devices that were initially assigned to the FBI to review but were not 
 included on the hard drive given to us on Friday. If these devices do have responsive confidential material on them, we 
 need to get that material from you ASAP, please. 
 Finally, the device highlighted below (NYCO24363) is the one we spoke about last week which you said would not be ready 
 on Friday to provide us with the responsive materials. Please let us know when this is done and how we can best get

 Hi 
 Would you mind canvassing for C-20 assistance for Friday? Maxwell's defense is asking to review discovery materials at 
 MDC on Friday. Same request as before where it would be from 8am-3pm. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard 
 drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team

 Hi everyone,

Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
 this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
 to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
 system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
 organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
 finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 EFTA00038215
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
 In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
 • NYC024363 
 • NYC024394 
 • NYC024326 
 • NYC024368 
 • NYC024390 
 • NYC024334 
 • NYC027910 
 • NYC024323 
 • NYC024355 
 • NYC027908 
 Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
 teams.

 Our Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) includes an investigative group who reviews news articles that might mention 
 activity with a Western Union touch. I believe that is what happened in this case — our news sweeps team picked up 
 information from an open source article, completed an investigation, and are in the process of filing a regulatory 
 report. Once filed, I would like to proactively share the report to law enforcement for review. Any assistance you can 
 provide would be greatly appreciated.

 Good morning, 
 To follow up an provide a bit more context for you: 
 Our Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) includes an investigative group who reviews news articles that might mention 
 activity with a Western Union touch. I believe that is what happened in this case — our news sweeps team picked up 
 information from an open source article, completed an investigation, and are in the process of filing a regulatory 
 report. Once filed, I would like to proactively share the report to law enforcement for review. Any assistance you can 
 provide would be greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks,

 Hi — 
 We have had some nonsensical Cybertipline reports for this case that have not been something that we thought to 
 forward you; however, today one of my analysts is working on a CT that she feels may want to be looked at. 
 I wanted to check with you to see if you want it before I have her forward it to you. The analyst listened to the phone call 
 to our call center, and she said that the woman sounds normal and organized in her thoughts, but who really knows 
 She has named a few other people in the tip. I wanted to pass these names by you before my analyst does any searches 
 on them to see if you think it is necessary. I don't want to waste a lot of time on this if she just watched the Netflix series, 
 and had a dream.. ugh 
 The Reporting Party (RP) is 
 These are the people she is mentioning in the report: 
 Just let me know how you want us to handle.

 Epstein matter during 2006-2008. We've found that the draft report is too large to email, so will set it separately in two

 Re: The Office of Professional Responsibility's Draft Report of Investigation into the 
 U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's Resolution of Its 2006-
 2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with 
 Victims during the Investigation 
 Dear Mr. 
 The Office of Professional Responsibility has been investigating allegations that 
 prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida improperly resolved 
 a federal criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-
 prosecution agreement (NPA) in 2007, and into judicial criticism of the government for failing to 
 consult with the victims of Epstein's crimes before the NPA was signed and by misleading them 
 regarding the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
 OPR has completed its investigation and has drafted a report setting forth its findings and 
 conclusions and the bases for them. Because of the congressional, victim, and public interest in 
 the investigation, OPR plans to release its final report to Congress and expects that its report will 
 be released to the public. Because the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was the investigating 
 agency and some of its work and special agents are mentioned in the report, OPR is providing you 
 with its draft report for a sensitivity review. 
 Please advise OPR if you have objections to the public release of information contained in 
 the draft report. Please note that the sourcing citations in the footnotes will be removed from the 
 final report. Therefore, names that appear in those footnotes, but which are otherwise not 
 identified in the text of the report, will not appear in the final report. FBI personnel are not 
 identified by name in the text of the report. 
 EFTA00038270
OPR would appreciate receiving your comments by Monday, September 14, 2020. 
 Because OPR's draft report is confidential, please share it only with those members of your staff 
 needed to evaluate the re ort's im act, if an , on our office's work. If ou have an uestions,

 Hi MI 
 That's not a problem at all! I'm glad that they would like to meet with us. We would be happy to sit down with 
 them. We've already set aside those days in case we had people who wanted to talk with us. 
 It would also be great to set up a time to discuss with you just a little bit of their background prior to going in to 
 meet with them. Thanks!

 Hey all, 
 I wanted to send a follow-up email about the device review. See below on who is covering what device. Happy to talk 
 through and sit down with those of you I haven't. Everyone should be set up by end of day today to have access to the 
 case. The AUSAs have asked that you read through the attachments to be familiar with it. They would also like to set up a 
 call sometime later today to touch base with all of you about the review. Is there a time everyone could get on a call, 
 maybe around 3:30 or a little later? 
 Let me know.

 Hi everyone, 
 Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
 this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
 to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
 system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
 EFTA00038272
organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
 finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
 In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

 • NYC024326

 • NYC027910 
 • NYC024323 
 • NYC024355 
 • NYC027908 
 Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
 teams.

 former Special Agent with the FBI and a former decorated Lt. Colonel and 
 helicopter pilot who served our country with honor and distinction during the 
 Vietnam War.   has informed me he believes he possesses important 
 information relative to the death of Jeffrey Epstein along with information 
 regarding Ghislaine Maxwell and he possesses relevant information to an 
 individual named J. Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison. 
 I am respectfully requesting as a former Assistant United States Attorney

 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

4 Stages of Emotions and Treatment After Sexual Trauma 
 April 18, 2018 • Contributed by Camila Williams, PhD 
 There may be many emotions to sort through after experiencing sexual trauma. These emotions are 
 typically painful, so it is natural to want to avoid them. The problem is, these emotions don't tend to 
 go away—they fester until you allow the time and space to work through them. 
 A common cycle of emotions after surviving sexual trauma is: (1) guilt and shame, (2) blame and 
 anger, (3) grieving/mourning, and (4) fear and anxiety. This cycle by no means captures everyone's 
 experience after a trauma but is a general outline of common reactions. Let's consider them in more 
 depth. 
 I. (,t IL I k\D'NII k Nil 
 There can be a lot of secrecy surrounding sexual trauma. Victims who come forward are often made 
 to feel like they did something wrong. Some are advised to keep their experience quiet. People often 
 blame the victim by outlining things they "should" or "should nor have done. 
 Survivors of sexual trauma may internalize these messages and feel guilt and shame. They may 
 replay in their minds the things they could have done to prevent or escape the trauma, even if they 
 couldn't have done anything differently. They may feel guilty for having not stopped the abuse and 
 ashamed for having been a victim of it. 
 Learning to challenge these messages is one of the first hurdles of trauma treatment. Treatment at 
 this stage focuses on self-compassion, understanding, and most importantly: accepting that sexual 
 trauma is never the victim's fault. 
 EFTA00038303
2. BI NIL .\NI) \\Fait 
 Along with guilt and shame come blame and anger. Many times, survivors of sexual trauma will 
 blame themselves for what happened and will direct anger at themselves. They beat themselves up 
 with critical, hurtful, and mean thoughts and comments. Some may even engage in self-harming 
 behaviors such as cutting as a coping strategy. 
 A goal at this stage of treatment is to separate responsibility from blame. Again, no matter what 
 happened, it is never a person's intention to get abused! Treatment focuses on challenging the 
 blame; challenging the hurtful, critical thoughts; and learning to look at things from a new 
 perspective and generate healthier, more adaptive thoughts. The blame and anger then shift to the 
 perpetrator, as it should. 
 Unfortunately, many people become stuck at this stage, fuming in anger and unable to move 
 forward. Anger can make us feel more in control. When we are angry, people listen, do what we say, 
 or leave us alone. There is power in anger that makes it hard to let go of. There can also be a fear 
 that if one lets go of the anger, it means it was okay that the trauma happened (of course, its not!). 
 Over time, chronic anger can lead to isolation, loneliness, and depression. Treatment focuses on 
 validating the anger, understanding why it's there, recognizing anger as a protective warning sign, 
 and learning to manage it before it escalates into verbal or physical aggression. 
 3. G1(11., \101 HAIM; 
 Grieving can help a survivor of sexual trauma to get unstuck and begin to move forward. There may 
 be many things to grieve: loss of innocence; loss of childhood; loss of feeling safe; grief over 
 mistrusting others and always feeling like something is "too good to be true"; grief over loss of time 
 (for school, relationships, jobs, or time spent self-medicating and in depression); and grief over "what 
 could have been." Grief can make us feel helpless, powerless, vulnerable, and weak. 
 It is natural to want to fast-forward through grief or, better yet, stuff it. 
 Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts through grieving. 
 It is natural to want to fast-forward through grief or, better yet, stuff it. Unfortunately, there are no 
 shortcuts through grieving. The more you try to avoid it, the more out-of-control your emotions may 
 feel. You may begin to fear crying or "losing it" when something triggers you. A common complaint 
 is "overreacting" to small things. But remember, your body is not just reading to the most recent 
 "small thing"; it is also reacting to all the stressful events you experienced and stuffed away. 
 Unpacking, unstuffing, and letting it all out is part of the grieving process. It is especially important 
 that you set up a support system and a regular schedule of self-care activities. Treatment at this 
 stage focuses on helping you establish the space, time, support to grieve and mourn. Treatment also 
 helps you learn how to manage intense emotions so you are the one in control, not the emotions. 
 EFTA00038304
4. FEAR k\D \ XIE I 
 After working through the guilt, shame, blame, and anger, and taking time to grieve and mourn, 
 many survivors of sexual trauma are left with a feeling of emptiness. All those emotions that were 
 stuffed away used to take up that space. Now that they are gone, many ask, "Now what?" 
 This phase of treatment focuses on building a life worth living. It is important to fill that hole with 
 new relationships, activities, goals, and emotions, as staying in that empty place can put you at risk 
 for becoming depressed and isolated. This process may bring a new set of challenges, as people—
 regardless of whether they have experienced trauma—generally hesitate to step out of their comfort 
 zones to try something new. 
 Trying to build a new life tends to raise many fears and anxieties. Fears that your efforts won't work, 
 that others will reject you, that your most critical thoughts were true. Anxiety about going to new 
 places, being out in crowds, starting relationships, and trying unfamiliar things. 
 Treatment at this stage attempts to help survivors of sexual trauma learn how to face their fears; to 
 set healthy boundaries; to problem-solve and work toward specific and measurable goals; and to 
 manage the natural anxieties that come with trying new approaches. 
 f. \ ( Ll SR) \ 
 There is hope after sexual trauma. Recovery is possible. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for 
 support, but it is the first step in learning to trust yourself and the recovery process. 
 April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Whatever the nature and scope of your trauma, this is a 
 time to remind yourself that you are not alone. Many colleges, hospitals, and groups throughout the 
 country are holding walks, fairs, clothesline projects, rallies, and other events. Look one up in your 
 area, discover the community you deserve, and contact a therapist if you want support.

 system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
 organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
 finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

 The "strap thing that was told to-was that at some point the therapist will have to attest that he/she is

 provide all possible information to-advised that if her treatment was no longer related to her 
 victimization then she could be billed for it. A therapist can theoretically state portions are victim related and 
 some are not. Although technically true, unlikely. 
 My colleague is capable of submitting the application directly to ovs online and was willing to meet with 
 right away and get it done in the most expeditious manner. The FBI form was provided by and 
 I forwarded it to her to complete the package. 
 Since my colleague works for the state lice she submits volumes of ovs applications and I consider her 
 extremely knowledgable able. Mis out this week so I can check in whether she submitted the FBI 
 form with the application. nformed me she forwarded you a copy of her ovs application via email already. 
 has her first appointment with a therapist today. 
 Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

 Hey - I apologize for reaching out with you being out; but I received calls from both and her

 also told me this person is submitting the OVS claim which is needed to be submitted by me with the FBI

 Gloria, 
 We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by the 
 FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing , who should be able to hopefully help 
 coordinate travel. Would you please provide with your new client's name as it appears on her ID, date of birth,

 Hi M, 
 Hope all is well. Someone we work with who does a lot of intel-gathering on john review boards saw the following post 
 on a review board called TNA. "Dollar Bill" is William Mersey. We prosecuted him for a felony promoting prostitution 
 conspiracy; he had a federal case as well. Don't want to waste your time and this may be complete bs, but I didn't want to

 Hey guys we came across his IC page which we believe is Maxwell's and should like to Subpoena (with NDO). 
 Also just FYI we received the response from Facebook on the 2 accounts we subpoenaed that we thought may 
 have been Maxwell's. It doesn't appear as though neither of them are associated with her according to IP 
 locations and general content on the page.

 Hi - I am a Victim Specialist in New York and am reaching out in hopes that you can assist or guide me in the right 
 direction. As you may have seen we have an open case regarding Jeffrey Epstein for trafficking charges. There is an 
 identified victim who lives in and she is asking for counseling assistance. How would I connect her to appropriate 
 referrals? I have asked her where she lives and am waiting to hear back. Any assistance is greatly appreciated. I have 
 copied the Case Agent if you have any questions.

 As you requested we checked for common or repeat IP addresses in the Maxwell cell phone pen trap with 
 negative results. We did find some random IP addresses in the pen trap that come back to facebook. 
 This leads us to believe she either has a facebook page, or has been accessing facebook from her phone. We 
 ran all of the phone numbers we've known to be associated with Maxwell through facebooks law enforcement 
 portal and found two of them to be associated with facebook accounts. Through the portal we are not able to 
 view the actual account but were able to see that there at least once existed an account that was connected 
 to these phone numbers.

 Team, 
 Just so everyone is in the loop, I got a call from David Rodgers' attorney (in response to our email requesting an 
 interview). Rodgers wants to be cooperative and will come in for an interview, but he is currently on a cruise, and his 
 lawyers will need to talk to/meet with him after he gets back. They think late January/early February is a good timeframe 
 to aim for. 
 We discussed logistics (because his attorneys are here in NYC), and they want us to fly him up, which shouldn't be a 
 problem. 
 We'll check in with his attorney in a week or so and let you know.

 Thank you so much for giving me a call today to discuss the therapy options for my three clients who 
 were among the original plaintiffs who filed civil lawsuits against Jeffrey E stein in South Florida. As I 
 mentioned, 2 are still in thand 1 is now living in II three are 
 in need of counseling services. 
 You mentioned that you will double-check the list of known JE victims to confirm they are eligible for 
 therapy assistance. I am providing  these names to  you confidentiality with the understanding  that they 
 will never become  part of a  public record and will otherwise remain confidential due to the women's 
 statuses as victims of child sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. They have never been  publicly identified 
 in any court records or media. 
 In the event that one or more of these women has not been previously identified to the FBI, please let 
 me know what information you need to determine their eligibility and I will get it to you in short order. 
 I would ask that all contact about these three women be through me (or my office) rather than with the 
 women directly. As we discussed on the phone, among the lingering effects for each of them is a 
 fundamental distrust of anyone trying to obtain information Epstein. He was not above lying and 
 trickery during the course of the lawsuits and he certainly had enough resources to buy real-looking 
 EFTA00038410
fake credentials for people to pose as FBI agents, so as sad as it is, they all assume that anyone who 
 contacts them has to be lying about their identities and motives. Also, as I mentioned, none of them

 It is probably best for everyone that I'm the 
 Please let me know what you need to get the counseling for each up and running. I will contact the 
 therapist that I know in the area that was interested in seeing to see if she takes credit 
 cards, and I will also do some homework on hat you 
 mentioned. will definitely need some referrals or recommendations if you have them; she does 
 not have any particular therapist in mind at this time. 
 Thanks again. And please know that I remain committed to assisting your team with their investi ation 
 in any way that I can, even if it does not involve my clients specifically. Between 
 and I, we probably have the best combined institutional knowledge of the case through 2011. I will 
 readily admit that is a much better resource for everything post-2011. But if I can assist in any

 Hi - it was great speaking with you today! As discussed due to Florida Crime Victims Compensation not 
 being available to victims where the crime was committed in Florida; the FBI Victim Services Division has 
 approved to pay up to 12 counseling sessions for these individuals. 
 If you have a client that would like to utilize this assistance - please send us their name for approval prior to any 
 therapy. We can not pay for sessions that were not approved prior. All requests must be approved by the Case 
 Agent . If they have not been confirmed a victim by the FBI prior; must confirm that they 
 are a victim in this case. 
 After they are approved - we can connect with the requested therapist to coordinate payment. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks for connecting us, 
 Hey you may remember me from around this time last year when I catalogued and scanned a bunch of Miami 
 evidence for the Epstein case. I'm now out on the JFK Airport squad, and I've been talking with about trying to get 
 more involved in the FO's human trafficking work since I'm sure a lot of it moves through the airports. I'm hoping to 
 maybe establish some stronger airport tripwires for it, so any human trafficking case experience I can get now to help me 
 to understand the violation better would be great. 
 So if you need people to help coming up, let me know. I'd still have to run it past my supervisor, but things are pretty 
 flexible out here schedule-wise. So just let me know the details if you still need people!

 Good afternoon, 
 Hope you've been doing well, enjoying the summer, and staying healthy! Just wanted to follow-up on the conversation we 
 had earlier in the year talking about me possibly getting hooked up with the human trafficking sitils to assist them now 
 that I'm out at the airport. I actually spent a day at LIRA last week and got to meet some of the team to discuss how I 
 might be able to supplement the work of their squad, and it was great to be able to chat with them. 
 Unfortunately it turns out that most of the flight-tracking tools used by the JTTF are for international flights, whereas • 
 es subjects are mostly flying domestic, which is kind of a bummer since we don't have a lot of ways to track that kind of 
 movement. But I'm still trying to think of ways I can use my position at the airport to be helpful, and that brought me back 
 to our discussion where we touched on the idea of providing trainings to staff at the airport, to hopefully establish better 
 tripwires and/or encourage staff to call the airport squad when they see something potentially suspicious. I know you said 
 you've given trainings on human trafficking before and you're familiar with the kind of training that would work at the 
 airport, and I'm definitely interested in pursuing this idea to hopefully put it into action once airport operations start to 
 return to normal. In the meantime, I want to brush up on the topic as much as I can. Would you happen to have access to 
 any Bureau-created or law enforcement-specific training materials besides what would come up on a basic Google search? 
 There's certainly a lot available via open sources, but if we have any internal presentation or training materials that you 
 could direct me to I would love to take a look at them. Or if you have any recommendations for open source websites or 
 articles, etc. on human trafficking that you've found particularly helpful, that would be great to know. 
 Thanks as always for your help and advice!

 Office of 
 Victim Services 
 Claim Application and 
 Instructions 
 How to Apply for Compensation 
 Who can apply for compensation? 
 Innocent victims of crime, certain relatives, dependents, 
 legal guardians and eligible Good Samaritans can apply 
 to the Office of Victim Services (OVS) for compensation 
 of out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance or 
 other resources. 
 What kind of expenses can I get compensated 
 for? 
 OVS offers compensation related to personal injury, 
 death and loss of essential personal property. 
 The specific expenses OVS may cover include: 
 • Medical, pharmacy and counseling expenses 
 • Loss of Essential Personal Property (up to $500, 
 including $100 for cash) 
 • Burial or Funeral Expenses (up to $6,000) 
 • Lost Wages or Lost Support (up to $30,000) 
 (Parents or guardians of hospitalized minor children 
 may be eligible for this benefit.) 
 • Transportation (court/medical) 
 • Occupational/Vocational Rehabilitation 
 • Security Devices and DV Shelter Costs 
 • Crime scene clean-up (up to $2,500) 
 • Good Samaritan property losses (up to $5,000) 
 • Moving expenses (up to $2,500) 
 How do I ask for compensation? 
 Send us your completed OVS application along with 
 copies of: 
 • Police reports 
 • Medical bills 
 • Correspondence with insurance companies 
 or benefits plan saying if they will cover your loss 
 • Insurance cards 
 • Receipts for essential personal property 
 • Death certificate and funeral contract 
 • Victim's birth certificate 
 • Proof of age (driver's license, birth certificate etc.) 
 • Legal guardianship papers 
 What if I don't have some of the papers OVS 
 needs? 
 Send your application in right away. You can send the 
 other documents later. 
 What if my property was lost, damaged or 
 destroyed because of the crime? 
 If you are under 18, 60 or over, disabled or were injured, 
 you may apply for benefits to replace your essential 
 personal property or cash that was not covered by any 
 other resource. 
 Essential means necessary for your health and welfare, 
 like eyeglasses and clothes. 
 What If I move? 
 Send OVS a signed letter right away. Tell us your new 
 address and phone number. Also let us know if your 
 email address changes. 
 Who can sign the claim? 
 Generally, the victim must sign the claim. However, if the 
 victim is under 18, or is physically or mentally incapable 
 of signing, then the legal guardian (the person receiving 
 the benefits) must fill out section 2 of the claim and sign 
 the claim. 
 If the victim died, the person asking for benefits must fill out 
 section 2 of the claim and sign the claim. 
 Is there another way to apply? 
 Yes. Visit ovs.ny.gov to access the secure Victim Service 
 Portal (VSP) and file an application on line. 
 Do I have to fill out the attached HIPPA form? 
 Yes. Fill out one HIPAA form for each service provider. 
 You can photocopy a blank form to make extra copies.

Court Ordered Restitution Information 
 What is restitution? 
 Restitution is compensation paid to a victim by the perpetrator of a criminal offense for the losses or injuries incurred as a 
 result of the criminal offense. It must be ordered by the Court at the time of sentencing, and is considered part of the sentence. 
 Restitution is NOT for payment of damages for future losses, mental anguish or "pain and suffering? 
 When the District Attorney's (DA) office advises the Court that you have requested restitution or when the victim impact 
 statement contained in the probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report) indicates that the 
 victim seeks restitution, the Court must order restitution unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. When the judge does 
 not order restitution, the judge must clearly state his/her reasons on the record. 
 What can I request as restitution? 
 You can ask for any expense you incur as a result of the criminal offense — even for items the OVS may not be able to 
 reimburse. Restitution may include, but is not limited to, reimbursement for medical bills, counseling expenses, loss of 
 earnings, funeral expenses, insurance deductibles and the replacement of stolen or damaged property. 
 Who is entitled to restitution? 
 Anyone who has been the victim of a criminal offense and has suffered injuries, economic losses or damages can seek 
 restitution. Many times, victims who deserve restitution do not request it. This can occur because victims are not aware that 
 they are entitled to restitution, or do not know what steps to take to go about receiving the restitution they deserve. 
 How do I ask for restitution? 
 You should contact the DA's office and advise them of the extent of your injury, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of 
 damages you are requesting. 
 It Is your responsibility to give the police, DA and, upon request, the local probation department copies of the bills and 
 other documents showing the extent of your injuries, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you want 
 considered by the Court. Your claim for restitution will be included in any probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea 
 or pre-disposition report). Be sure to: 
 • Keep accurate records such as original receipts of any expenses you have as a direct result of the criminal offense. 
 • Give copies of these receipts to the police. DA and local probation department. 
 You need to clearly explain your need for restitution as soon as possible to the DA, the victim/witness advocate, and the 
 probation department. Plea agreements can occur within days of the actual criminal offense. If this information is not provided 
 before the plea agreement and sentencing, you may have to pursue the perpetrator in Civil Court. 
 The DA is under an obligation to petition the Court to order restitution on your behalf. 
 In all felony criminal cases, many misdemeanor criminal cases and all juvenile delinquency and persons in need of supervision 
 (PINS) cases, a pre-sentence or predisposition investigation report is required. The local probation department will contact you 
 about the issue of restitution as it pertains to your case. 
 How Is restitution determined? 
 The amount of restitution is based on proof of your out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the criminal offense. The 
 perpetrator has a right to object to the amount of restitution. The Court may hold a hearing on the issue of restitution where the 
 Court may consider the perpetrator's ability to pay. The DA's office may contact you and ask you to testify at the restitution 
 hearing. If you have a concern about appearing personally in Court, you should explore alternatives with the DA assigned to 
 your case. 
 If the OVS has paid your bills, the Court may order that restitution payments be made to the OVS for those paid items. It is 
 important that you advise the DA's Office that you filed a claim with the OVS. 
 If you filed a claim with the OVS, it is important that you advise the OVS if the Court orders the perpetrator to pay restitution.

 parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any 
 such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by 
 the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably

 Good evening, 
 Sorry for my late response; I was out of the office yesterday and I shifted my schedule late today because I'm just about to 
 rotate in as the duty agent, so I'm just catching up now. 
 But thank you, I'll definitely reach out to about that training! 
 And yes, I actually helped out with the Epstein case a little bit when I was on Applicants, and I'd definitely be up to help 
 out again! That would be great experience since I haven't done discovery from the Agent side yet. Thanks so much for 
 thinking of me! 
 I also have it on my list to message from I= to reach out in the same way I've done with =, so that 
 could be very timely. Will let you know if I make some headway!

Good afternoon, 
 Hope you've been doing well, enjoying the summer, and staying healthy! Just wanted to follow-up on the conversation we 
 had earlier in the year talking about me possibly getting hooked up with the human trafficking sjads to assist them now 
 that I'm out at the airport. I actually spent a day at LIRA last week and got to meet some of the team to discuss how I 
 might be able to supplement the work of their squad, and it was great to be able to chat with them. 
 Unfortunately it turns out that most of the flight-tracking tools used by the JTTF are for international flights, whereas • 
 es subjects are mostly flying domestic, which is kind of a bummer since we don't have a lot of ways to track that kind of 
 movement. But I'm still trying to think of ways I can use my position at the airport to be helpful, and that brought me back 
 to our discussion where we touched on the idea of providing trainings to staff at the airport, to hopefully establish better 
 tripwires and/or encourage staff to call the airport squad when they see something potentially suspicious. I know you said 
 you've given trainings on human trafficking before and you're familiar with the kind of training that would work at the 
 airport, and I'm definitely interested in pursuing this idea to hopefully put it into action once airport operations start to 
 return to normal. In the meantime, I want to brush up on the topic as much as I can. Would you happen to have access to 
 any Bureau-created or law enforcement-specific training materials besides what would come up on a basic Google search? 
 There's certainly a lot available via open sources, but if we have any internal presentation or training materials that you 
 could direct me to I would love to take a look at them. Or if you have any recommendations for open source websites or 
 articles, etc. on human trafficking that you've found particularly helpful, that would be great to know. 
 Thanks as always for your help and advice! 
 Best,

 The following Epstein victims have been treating with therapist in West Palm Beach. I understand that 
 some have exceeded the 6 sessions that are covered by the FBI, but that the FBI may be covering additional sessions. Do 
 you have any info on that? Also, do you know if has been reimbursed for the sessions that she has conducted 
 with each of these victims? 
 I know that you are crazy busy, so let me know how I can help on this, or if there is someone else in your office that you 
 want me to reach out to. 
 As always, thank you so much for everything that you do.

 Subject: Request for foreign travel IOD approval to London for Epstein investigation 
 Date: Tue, 10 Mar 2020 18:02:34 +0000 
 Importance: Normal 
 Can you send this request for foreign travel up the chain to the ADIC for approval? Due to travel restrictions, AD 
 IOD has been granting approval for international travel directly to field division heads. CACHTU will support 
 this request with funding. Summary below. 
 This email is to request the foreign travel to London for two agents, accompanied by SDNY AUSA's for the 
 week of March 16th, in furtherance of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. We expect to leave on the 17th and 
 return on the 20th. The u ose of this trip is to interview a crucial witness in this investigation. The witness is. 
 who could prove especially crucial since it is believed this witness was the target 
 subject's personal assistant and was an eyewitness to the sexual abuse of a minor, therefore this witness could 
 significantly corroborate the victim's accounts. The time and location for this interview has been arranged by the 
 witness' attorney who has been historically difficult about changes. Both the witness and attorney reside in 
 London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview could prove to be vital to the indictment 
 of one of Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators. 
 Thank you,

 AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
 compensation fund protocol 
 • Jun 1, 2020 
 Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
 over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
 release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
 George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
 victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
 The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
 having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
 new charges. 
 In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
 Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
 the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
 criminal sex trafficking operation. 
 As part of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
 from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
 protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
 V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
 and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
 George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
 working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
 fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
 George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
 publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
 the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
 victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
 According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
 • Involvement of victim advocate and the country's preeminent expert and 
 advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
 informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
 • Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
 claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
 • Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
 potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
 • Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
 EFTA00038493
• Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
 General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
 "The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
 victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
 release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
 choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
 committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
 used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
 The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
 funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
 expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
 "I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
 my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
 are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
 criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
 will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

 Squad C-20 advised that if you are able to assist on just one of the days that would also work. Any assistance is greatly 
 appreciated. 
 Please let me know if you are able to assist on 4/13, 4/14 or 4/15 
 Squad C-20 is requesting two or three agents to assist with Maxwell and her defense team reviewing evidence at 500 
 Pearl Street from Tuesday April 13 throw Thursday April 15. This will be from 9:00am and continue for the entire day 
 for all three days. AUSA will be present as well for the review. Please see below for additional info. 
 • Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 5th floor of the 500 Pearl Street 
 courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13, 2021 and will continue every day thereafter until 
 the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows: 
 o The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense counsel are 
 expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. We will need at least one FBI agent with a handcuff key who is 
 responsible for pulling Maxwell from the Marshal cellblock and monitoring her (the same way an agent would monitor any 
 proffering inmate at 500 Pearl) throughout the day. Please note that an agent will likely need to escort Maxwell to the 
 bathroom dulgilie day as well. 
 o AUSA has reserved three proffer moms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the 
 evidence for review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence items, to 
 confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or AUSAs who are not currently 
 monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell.

 Hey all, 
 I thought it might be easier if we were able to get on a quick call to talk a little logistics next week and answer any 
 questions you have. I'm sure everyone is busy but if at least someone who is helping each day does not mind jumping on 
 a call tomorrow that might be helpful. I'm not sure who has or has not pulled a prisoner from Marshal custody so we can 
 go over those logistics as well on the phone. Let me know if sometime tomorrow works for you.

 Thank you so much for helping out next week. I don't anticipate we will need four agents for Tuesday and Thursday so if 
 anyone has something else pressing feel free to bow out. I'll be sending you all another email shortly and cc'ing AUSA 
 who will be present at 500 Pearl all three days. She will meet you at 500 Pearl on the designated date at 
 around 9am or shortly before. Maxwell and her team will be arriving at 9:30am. The evidence unit is transporting all 
 evidence to 500 Pearl and that has already been coordinated. Please make sure to have a handcuff key on you. The 
 review of evidence each day will last until 4:30pm. The evidence unit will transport evidence back so none of you need to 
 worry about any evidence being transported. 
 SOS will also be present all three days and has been working this case so she is familiar with everything. 
 Feel free to reach out to her as well. She is cc'd on this email. 
 That's the short overview. Feel free to reach out to me on my cell with any concerns or questions. will be in 
 touch with you all as well. Thank you all for assisting with this. This is a huge help.

 Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an 
 Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas 
 approved each year and the timeframe. 
 I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?

 Hey= 
 I attached the three spreadsheets showing what is likely to be transported to 500 Pearl. Below is some of the logistical 
 information. 
 • Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 5," floor of the 500 Pearl Street 
 courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13 2021 and will continue every day thereafter 
 until the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows: 
 • The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense 
 counsel are expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. 
 • There are three proffer rooms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the evidence for 
 review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence 
 items, to confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or 
 AUSAs who are not currently monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell. 
 • There are three annotated spreadsheets of the evidence in this case. Each day, the FBI will need to plan 
 to produce all of the evidence with the notation "500 Pearl" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by 
 Defense" in each of the three attached spreadsheets. 
 • At least one agent and at least one AUSA should plan to be in the room whenever the defense is 
 reviewing the evidence. The AUSA will field any questions from the defense. 
 • At the end of each review day, the AUSA plans to ask the defense to identify any items that do not need to 
 be brought back to 500 Pearl the next day, which will hopefully make each subsequent review day less 
 burdensome for the FBI. 
 • Three members of the defense team plan to travel to the Bronx warehouse to review evidence that the FBI is not 
 producing to 500 Pearl Street. The logistics for that review are as follows: 
 • This will be Monday, April 120. 
 • For this review, the defense team will be looking to review all evidence with the notation "Bronx 
 Warehouse" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by Defense" in each of the three attached 
 spreadsheets. 
 • At least one agent and at least one AUSA will be present to monitor the review. The AUSA will field any 
 questions from the defense. 
 • The defense team will bring a camera to photograph certain of the items to be reviewed. 
 Thank you for assisting with this! 
 Feel free to reach out with any questions!

 After we interviewed Larry Visoski in November for our case, we have been trying to coordinate with our HSI partners to 
 interview our subject, in an effort to close the loop on our case. We have finally set a date and are traveling to South 
 Carolina next week to interview him. (Our subject is a CBP employee who previously covered St. Thomas airport, and 
 supposedly knew/socialized with Epstein). 
 Just in case, I wanted to check in with you to see if there was anything in particular that you would want me to ask our 
 subject while we have him, if it helps you.

 Hey 
 I attached the three spreadsheets showing what is likely to be transported to 500 Pearl. Below is some of the logistical 
 information. 
 • Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 51h floor of the 500 Pearl Street 
 courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13 2021 and will continue every day thereafter 
 until the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows: 
 o The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense 
 counsel are expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. 
 o There are three proffer rooms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the evidence for 
 review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence 
 items, to confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or 
 AUSAs who are not currently monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell. 
 o There are three annotated spreadsheets of the evidence in this case. Each day, the FBI will need to plan 
 to produce all of the evidence with the notation "500 Pearl" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by 
 Defense" in each of the three attached spreadsheets. 
 o At least one agent and at least one AUSA should plan to be in the room whenever the defense is 
 reviewing the evidence. The AUSA will field any questions from the defense. 
 o At the end of each review day, the AUSA plans to ask the defense to identify any items that do not need to 
 be brought back to 500 Pearl the next day, which will hopefully make each subsequent review day less 
 burdensome for the FBI. 
 • Three members of the defense team plan to travel to the Bronx warehouse to review evidence that the FBI is not 
 producing to 500 Pearl Street. The logistics for that review are as follows: 
 o This will be Monday, April 12th. 
 o For this review, the defense team will be looking to review all evidence with the notation "Bronx 
 Warehouse" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by Defense" in each of the three attached 
 spreadsheets. 
 o At least one agent and at least one AUSA will be present to monitor the review. The AUSA will field any 
 questions from the defense. 
 o The defense team will bring a camera to photograph certain of the items to be reviewed. 
 Thank you for assisting with this!

 Where traveling: Durango, CO 
 Case Summary: 
 FBI New York, in coordination with the Southern District of New York's United States Attorney's Office, 
 has been investigating the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors committed by JEFFREY EPSTEIN and 
 his co-conspirators. EPSTEIN was charged and arrested with sex trafficking and conspiracy in July 
 2019. In addition to EPSTEIN, co-conspirators have also been investigated, including GHISLAINE 
 MAXWELL. MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and contributed to EPSTEIN's abuse of minors by recruiting, 
 grooming, and abusing minors they knew to be under the age of 18. MAXWELL was charged and 
 arrested in July 2020 with enticement of a minor, transportation of a minor, conspiracy to entice a 
 minor, conspiracy to transport a minor, and perjury. 
 Purpose of Travel (victim interview(s); witness interview(s); search warrant; arrest warrant; etc.): 
 We will be meeting with a victim and to conduct an interview pertaining to her abuse by EPSTEIN and 
 MAXWELL. Victim has been interviewed over video conference in the past but we hope to conduct a 
 more in depth interview in person as she may be chosen as a trial witness against MAXWELL. 
 Has a CAFI been consulted if interviewing minor(s)? If no, explain? N/A 
 Name(s) of Personnel Traveling (If requesting more than one Agent/TFO from the field office, please 
 provide justification. ex: pending state charges; multiple victims; rapport with victim(s)/witness(es); 
 etc.): 
 SA & TFOare expecting to interview a victim over a 1-2 day period. Due to 
 the likelihood of a possible superseding indictment and eventual trial and the rapport we have 
 developed with this witness, both case agents are requesting permission to travel. Victim has previously 
 met with FBI victim specialist and it has been determined that she will benefit more from an in-person 
 interview.

 Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline 
 FBI Miami investigation: 
 • In 2005, the West Palm Beach Police Department, and then FBI Miami, initiated an 
 investigation of Epstein after parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein 
 had sexually abused their daughter from 2002-2005. 
 • Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among other things, 
 interviews with approximately 35 victims, a search warrant executed on Epstein's Florida 
 (FL) residence, and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. 
 FBI New York investigation: 
 • On December 6, 2018, FBI NY initiated a case after Southern District of New York (SDNY) 
 contacted FBI NY regarding several victims that had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein 
 in the mid 2000's. 
 • Beginning in at least 2002, Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in 
 sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Some of his 
 victims were as young as 14. 
 • He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
 Manhattan, New York and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. 
 • Searches were executed at both locations and it bears noting that, contrary to some news 
 reports, these searches did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage 
 rooms at Epstein's residences. 
 • In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, Epstein worked 
 with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
 by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with 
 Epstein, both in New York and in Florida. 
 Indictment of Epstein 
 • From January 2019 through June 2019 multiple victim witness interviews were conducted in 
 New York and Florida 
 • The identified victims' ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been 
 approximately 15 or 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. In 
 addition to the sex acts, victims would have to perform massages on Epstein nude or partially 
 nude. Victims were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they went to Epstein's 
 residence.

 The attached item titled "Masseuses" was going to initially be a trial exhibit but was not used at the Maxwell 
 trial. It was located on one of Epstein's digital devices seized from his Manhattan residence. The names listed are 
 believed to be women and girls, some of which were identified minors, who were contacted by Epstein, 
 Maxwell, and his staff to massage Epstein. 
 Separately, the black book was seized by Miami -Palm Beach during the course of their 72 investigation. It is an 
 address book that included identified minors under "massage". Sections of this book were a trial exhibit. 
 The flight logs were kept and provided by Epstein's pilot This was a trial exhibit. 
 At trial, the black book and the flight logs had minor victims redacted from the public.

 I'm reattaching the master list I compiled along with all of the source documents for RIDS. While I was going 
 through all of the names, I saw that there were different versions of names on the different documents. For the 
 ETS list, RIDS or someone down there in Virginia should go through the lists slowly to make sure we are 
 searching for all permutations of victims names so nothing accidentally gets left un-readacted.

 Subject: Masseuse List, black book, flight logs 
 The attached item titled "Masseuses" was going to initially be a trial exhibit but was not used at the Maxwell 
 trial. It was located on one of Epstein's digital devices seized from his Manhattan residence. The names listed are 
 believed to be women and girls, some of which were identified minors, who were contacted by Epstein, 
 Maxwell, and his staff to massage Epstein. 
 Separately, the black book was seized by Miami -Palm Beach during the course of their 72 investigation. It is an 
 address book that included identified minors under "massage". Sections of this book were a trial exhibit. 
 The flight logs were kept and provided by Epstein's pilot. This was a trial exhibit. 
 At trial, the black book and the flight logs had minor victims redacted from the public. 
 Let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.

 ROBERTSON, 
 Plaintiffs, 
 -against-
 FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
 INVESTIGATION, 
 Defendant. 
 ORDER 
 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG) 
 PAUL G. GARDEPHE, U.S.D.J.: 
 Plaintiffs Radar Online LLC and James Robertson bring this action under the 
 Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), seeking records related to the FBI's investigation and 
 prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein for child sex trafficking crimes. ( Am. Cmplt. (Dkt. 
 No. 12)) Plaintiff Radar Online is an online investigative news outlet and Plaintiff Robertson is 
 one of its senior editors. (Id. ¶¶ 2-3) 
 Plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
 ("FBI") on April 20, 2017. (Id.¶ 10) Plaintiffs received no response, and filed this action on 
 May 25, 2017. (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 1)) The Amended Complaint was filed on August 28, 2017. 
 (Am. Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 12)) After an initial case management conference on September 7, 2017, 
 the FBI agreed to begin producing documents at a rate of 500 pages per month. The FBI has 
 now processed 11,571 responsive pages, most of which were redacted in part or withheld in full 
 based on certain exemptions to disclosure under FOIA. (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58)1 3) 
 In July 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and charged with new Federal offenses, 
 at which point the FBI asserted Exemption 7(A) to FOIA — the exemption for "records or 
 information compiled for law enforcement purposes[,] ... [the disclosure of which] could

 reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings" 5 U.S.C. § 552(bX7)(A) — 
 over pages that were previously processed and withheld and over all "remaining responsive 
 records." (a. 1 7) 
 On December 10, 2020, this Court directed the parties to file cross-motions for 
 summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 26) In a September 19, 2023 order (the "Summary Judgment 
 Order"), this Court granted in part and denied in part each side's cross-motion. (Summary 
 Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51)) In its Order, this Court directed the parties to file a joint letter 
 addressing next steps, including a proposed schedule for the FBI's revised declarations and any 
 renewed motions for summary judgment. (s., at 54) I On October 3, 2023, this Court set a 
 briefing schedule for the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 53) 
 For the reasons stated below, the FBI's motion for summary judgment will be 
 granted, and Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment will be denied. 
 BACKGROUND'
 I. FACTS 
 In support of its renewed summary judgment motion, the FBI submitted a revised 
 declaration from Maureen Comey, an Assistant United States Attorney ("AUSA") in the United 
 States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 
 59)1 1), and a revised declaration from Michael G. Seidel, the Section Chief of the 
 Record/Information Dissemination Section ("RIDS") of the FBI's Information Management 
 Division ("IMD"). (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58) 1 1)

 A. Plaintiffs' FOIA Request and the Instant Action 
 Epstein was a financier who in June 2008 pleaded guilty to "a criminal charge of 
 procuring prostitution of a minor," and served thirteen months of an eighteen-month sentence. 
 (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58)1 6) On April 20, 2017, Plaintiff Robertson submitted a 
 FOIA request to the FBI seeking "all documents relating to the FBI's investigation and 
 prosecution" of Epstein. (First Seidel Decl., Ex. A. (FOIA Request) (Dkt. No. 50-1) at 4) 
 On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted by a federal grand jury in this District on 
 "one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking .. . [and] one count of sex trafficking." 
 (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58)1 6 (citing United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
 (S.D.N.Y.), Indictment (Dkt. No. 2))) After the July 2, 2019 indictment, the FBI "began to 
 categorically assert Exemption 7(A) with respect to information in the remaining documents it 
 was processing .. . on the basis that release could negatively impact the then-pending 
 prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and any related investigations." (l 17) The FBI further 
 "asserted Exemption 7(A) over all information that had been withheld under other exemptions 
 prior to that date." atl.) 
 Epstein committed suicide at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan on 
 August 10, 2019, while the charges against him were pending. OA (citing United States v. 
 Epstein 19 Cr. 490 (RMB), Nolle Prosequi (Dkt. No. 52))) 
 B. The Prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell 
 On June 29, 2020, Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury in this District 
 on "one count of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts"; "one count 
 of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts"; "one count of conspiracy to 
 transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity"; "one count of transportation

 of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity"; "and two counts of perjury." (Third 
 Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 6) 
 On December 29, 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty of enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in illegal sex acts, transporting minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, and three related conspiracy counts. (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 8; 20 Cr. 330, 
 Dkt. Sheet at Dec. 29, 2021) On June 28, 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years' 
 imprisonment. (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 8; 20 Cr. 330, Judgment (Dkt. No. 696)) 
 On July 7, 2022, Maxwell appealed her conviction to the Second Circuit. (Third 
 Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 9) Maxwell seeks, inter a "a new trial based on alleged juror 
 misconduct and alleged evidentiary issues." (a) Her appeal remains pending. GA  1 8) 
 H. THE SEPTEMBER 19.2023 SUMMARY JUDGMENT ORDER 
 In its September 19, 2023 Order, this Court granted the FBI summary judgment as 
 to records withheld under Exemption 3 pursuant to the Child Victims' Act (Summary Judgment 
 Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 26); Exemption 5 for attorney work-product privilege CA at 31-33); 
 Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect persons from an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (a 
 at 33-42); Exemption 7(D) to protect confidential information provided by local law enforcement 
 agencies (a. at 4748); and Exemption 7(E) to protect against disclosure of law enforcement 
 techniques, procedures, and guidelines. at 48-51) 
 As to Exemption 7(A), this Court found that the FBI's invocation of this 
 Exemption was timely and that the requested records were compiled for law enforcement 
 purposes and related to a pending or prospective law enforcement proceeding. (IS at 11-18) 
 The FBI, however, "ha[d] not explicitly linked any of the document categories — whether 
 Seidel's or Comey's — to the four types of potential harm cited in the 2021 Comey declaration."

 EFTA00038655
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 5 of 20 
 (I at 21) As a result, this Court denied the FBI's motion for summary judgment without 
 prejudice as to Exemption 7(A) because the FBI had not demonstrated that the disclosure of the 
 requested records would interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings. 
 ask at 18-25) 
 This Court also denied without prejudice the FBI's motion for summary judgment 
 as to records withheld under Exemption 3 pursuant to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act, 
 18 U.S.C. § 5038, which shields the arrest information and criminal history of third-party 
 juveniles, and Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e), which shields matters occurring before the grand jury. (_0, 
 at 26-31) 
 Finally, this Court denied without prejudice the FBI's motion for summary 
 judgment as to records withheld under Exemption 7(D) for the protection of information 
 provided under an explicit or implicit assurance of confidentiality, and for information provided 
 by foreign agencies. (Id. at 4247) 
 As noted above, in the Summary Judgment Order, this Court directed the parties 
 to submit a joint letter as to next steps, and to propose a "schedule for the FBI's submission of 
 revised declarations, as well as any renewed motions for summary judgment." (W, at 54) After 
 the parties submitted a joint letter (Dkt. No. 52), this Court issued an October 3, 2023 order 
 setting a briefmg schedule for the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. 
 No. 53)

 On January 30, 2024, the parties filed their renewed cross-motions for summary 
 judgment. (Dkt. Nos. 56, 61) 
 DISCUSSION 
 I. LEGAL STANDARDS 
 A. Rule 56 standard 
 Summary judgment is warranted where the moving party shows that "there is no 
 genuine dispute as to any material fact" and that it "is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." 
 Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "A dispute about a `genuine issue' exists for summary judgment purposes 
 where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the non-movant's favor." 
 Beyer v. County of Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir. 2008). "When no rational jury could find 
 in favor of the nonmoving party because the evidence to support its case is so slight, there is no 
 genuine issue of material fact and a grant of summary judgment is proper." Gallo v. Prudential 
 Residential Servs.. Ltd. P'ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing Dister v. Cont'l Grp., 
 Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1114 (2d Cir. 1988)). 
 In deciding a summary judgment motion, the Court "`resolve[s] all ambiguities, 
 and =digs] all factual inferences that could rationally be drawn, in favor of the party opposing 
 summary judgment."' Spinelli v. City of New York, 579 F.3d 160, 166 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting 
 Brown v. Henderson, 257 F.3d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation 
 omitted)). However, a 'party may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true 
 nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment.. . . [M]ere conclusory 
 allegations or denials ... cannot by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where 
 none would otherwise exist.'" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2010) (alterations in 
 original) (quoting Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., 68 F.3d 1451, 1456 (2d Cir. 1995)).

 "The same standard[s] appl[y] where, as here, the parties file[] cross-motions for 
 summary judgment...." Morales v. Ouintel Entm't. Inc., 249 F.3d 115, 121 (2d Cir. 2001). 
 "[W]hen both parties move for summary judgment, asserting the absence of any genuine issues 
 of material fact, a court need not enter judgment for either party. Rather, each party's motion 
 must be examined on its own merits, and in each case all reasonable inferences must be drawn 
 against the party whose motion is under consideration." Id. (internal citations omitted). 
 B. Summary Judgment in FOIA Cases 
 "Summary judgment is the procedural vehicle by which most FOIA actions are 
 resolved." Jones-Edwards v. Appeal Bd. of Nat. Sec. Agency Cent. Sec. Agency, 352 F. Supp. 
 2d 420, 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). "In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA 
 case, the defending agency has the burden of showing that [1] its search was adequate[,] and [2] 
 any withheld documents fall within an exemption to the FOIA." Carney v. U.S. Dept. of Justice 
 19 F.3d 807, 812 (2d Cir. 1994). 
 A government agency may sustain its burden through "c[a]ffidavits or 
 declarations [that] supply(' facts indicating that the agency has conducted a thorough search and 
 [that] giv[e] reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an 
 exemption.' Associated Press v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2007 WL 737476, at •3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
 7, 2007) (quoting Carney. 19 F.3d at 812); accord Garcia v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Info. 
 & Privacy, 181 F. Supp. 2d 356, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). m[T]he general rule in this Circuit is that 
 in FOIA actions, agency affidavits alone will support a grant of summary judgment,' and Local 
 Civil Rule 56.1 statements are not required." N.Y. Times Co. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 872 F. 
 Supp. 2d 309, 314 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Ferguson v. FBI 1995 WL 329307, at •2 (S.D.N.Y.

 June 1, 1995), afFcl, 83 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 1996)). "Affidavits submitted by an agency are 
 presumed to have been made in good faith." Garcia, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 366. 
 "[D]iscovery relating to the agency's search and the exemptions it claims for 
 withholding records generally is unnecessary if the agency's submissions are adequate on their 
 face." Carney, 19 F.3d at 812. "A district court ... may grant summary judgment in favor of an 
 agency `on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather 
 than merely conclusory statements, and if they are not called into question by contradictory 
 evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith."' Grand Cent. P'ship. Inc. v. Cuomo 
 166 F.3d 473, 478 (2d Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original) (quoting Gallant v. N.L.R.B., 26 F.3d 
 168, 171 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). A plaintiff may avoid summary judgment and obtain discovery 
 where, "once the agency has satisfied its burden, the plaintiff ... make[s] a showing of bad faith 
 on the part of the agency ... or provide[s] some tangible evidence that an exemption claimed by 
 the agency should not apply." Conti v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Sec., 2014 WL 1274517, at "10 
 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2014). 
 II. FOIA EXEMPTION 7fAl 
 The FBI again argues that all of the withheld records responsive to Plaintiffs' 
 FOIA request were properly withheld under Exemption 7(A) to FOIA. (Sc.. Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 
 57) at 10-21; Second Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 47); Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59)) Plaintiff 
 responds that the FBI's declarations do not link any of the document categories to potential 
 harms. (Phi Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3-4) According to Plaintiffs, "[w]hile [the FBI declarations] 
 now divided the material at issue into a greater number of categories, [they] offerd nothing to 
 substantiate how releasing records within that category will likely result in harm." U at 3 
 (emphasis in original))

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 9 of 20 
 A. Applicable Law 
 Exemption 7(A) to FOIA permits government agencies to withhold "records or 
 information compiled for law enforcement purposes" where "the production of such law 
 enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere with 
 enforcement proceedings." 5 U.S.C. § 552(bX7)(A). "This exemption 'prevent[s] harm to the 
 government's case in court by not allowing litigants earlier or greater access to agency 
 investigatory files than they would otherwise have.' N.Y. Times Co. v. United States Dept. of 
 Justice, 2016 WL 5946711, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2016) (quoting Conti, 2014 WL 1274517, 
 at *22). "Mt' the exemption applies, it `will justify denial of release, not only to the objects of 
 the investigation and any pending or prospective enforcement actions, but to third parties as 
 well.' Stein v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n, 2017 WL 3141903, at *11 (D.D.C. July 24, 2017) 
 (quoting Kanter v. IRS, 433 F. Supp. 812, 817 (N.D. Ill. 1977)). 
 In order to demonstrate that Exemption 7(A) applies, the government must show 
 that (1) "the requested records were compiled for law enforcement purposes," Local 32B-32J, 
 Serv. Employees Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Gen. Servs. Admin. 1998 WL 726000, at *7 
 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); (2) "a law enforcement proceeding 
 is pending or prospective," Amnesty Int'l USA v. C.I.A. 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 525 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2010); and (3) "release of the information could reasonably be expected to cause some 
 articulable harm." Id. 
 "[A]lthough [courts] give deference to an agency's predictive judgment of the 
 harm that will result from disclosure of information, it is not sufficient for the agency to simply 
 assert that disclosure will interfere with enforcement proceedings; it must rather demonstrate 
 how disclosure will do so." Stein, 2017 WL 3141903, at *9 (quoting Citizens for Responsibility

 & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice ("CREW I") 746 F.3d 1082, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2014)) 
 (emphasis in CREW I). "Ultimately, the government must `allow[ the court to trace a rational 
 link between the nature of the document and the alleged likely interference."' N.Y. Times Co., 
 2016 WL 5946711, at *7 (quoting Ctr. for Nat'l Sec. Studies v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 331 F.3d 
 918, 940 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). 
 B. Interference with Law Enforcement Proceedings 
 and the Applicability of Exemption 7(A) 
 The FBI contends that "the records responsive to the FOIA requests withheld in 
 full or in part . [a]ll... fall within the scope of Exemption 7(A)" (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. 
 No. 59)1i 11), because their "public disclosure ... could reasonably be expected to interfere with 
 the pending prosecution of [Ghislaine] Maxwell." all 12) 
 In previously denying the FBI summary judgment as to the applicability of 
 Exemption 7(A), this Court noted that (1) the Seidel and Comey Declarations submitted in 
 support of this request categorized the documents at issue inconsistently; and (2) "the FBI has 
 not explicitly linked any of the document categories .. . to the four types of potential harm cited 
 in the [First] Comey declaration." (Summary Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 21) 
 The First Comey Declaration grouped the responsive records sought by Plaintiffs 
 and withheld by the FBI into three categories: (1) "[i]nterview forms, reports and notes ... of 
 interviews with individuals, including victims"; (2) "Federal Grand Jury Subpoenas and 
 Subpoenaed information"; and (3) "documents provided by state and local law enforcement 
 agencies, background information for witnesses . . . and subjects for the investigation[,] 
 communications within the FBI [and between the FBI and other agencies] regarding the 
 investigation[,] organizational documents, ... the sources from and techniques through which

 such information and evidence was gathered[,] ... the methods used to analyze the information 
 and evidence, ... and the focus of the investigation." (First Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 39) ¶ 11) 
 The First Seidel Declaration — on the other hand — speaks of nine "types of 
 responsive recordss3 and three "functional categories of information": 
 (1) "Evidentiary/Investigative Materials," including "confidential witness statements" and 
 "information exchanged between the FBI and its local law enforcement partners"; 
 (2) "Administrative [M]aterials," including internal agency "reporting communications" 
 pertaining to an investigation, and other "standardized forms used for a variety of purposes"; and 
 (3) "public source material," including news articles and court transcripts which have already 
 been "released ... to Plaintiffs." (First Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 50) ¶¶ 58-68 (capitalization 
 altered)) This Court pointed out that "[t]he document categories in the [First] Seidel 
 [D]eclaration and in the [First] Comey Declaration do not match, and documents falling within 
 each of the Comey categories likely span multiple categories described by Seidel." (Summary 
 Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 21) 
 The FBI now relies on the First Seidel Declaration's three "functional categories 
 of information" — (1) Evidentiary/Investigative materials, (2) Administrative Materials, and (3) 
 Public Source/Non-Investigative Harm. (First Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 50) ¶ 59) — and the Third 
 Comey Declaration submitted in support of the FBI's instant motion adopts the same 
 categorization. (See Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 13) With the Government's 
 3 (1) "FD-1057 - Electronic Communication"; (2) "Interview Forms (FD-302)"; (3) 
 "Handwritten Interview Notes"; (4) "State and Local Law Enforcement Documents"; 
 (5) "Documents Implementing Sensitive Investigative Techniques"; (6) "Federal Grand 
 Jury Subpoenas/Subpoenaed Information"; (7) "FD-340, IA Envelopes"; (8) "Other 
 Investigative Documents"; and (9) "Internet Printouts." (First Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 50) 
 ¶¶ 58-68 (formatting altered))

 EFTA00038662
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 12 of 20 
 categorization of responsive documents now consistent, this Court can move on to consider 
 whether the FBI has linked these document categories to potential harms and explained how 
 those harms could "reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings." 5 U.S.C. 
 § 552(b)(7)(A). 
 As to the harm that would result from disclosure, the FBI notes that "the Maxwell 
 criminal prosecution is still pending on appeal," and "Ulf the Second Circuit grants Maxwell the 
 relief she seeks, there could be a new trial." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 12) 
 Accordingly, "public disclosure of the FBI's records relating to the investigation and prosecution 
 of Epstein that were withheld in full or in part under Exemption 7(A) could reasonably be 
 expected to interfere with the pending prosecution of Maxwell." (11) 
 As discussed below, in the FBI's revised declarations filed in support of the 
 instant motion, the Bureau now lists the potential harms that may arise from public disclosure, 
 and does so as to each category of documents. 
 The first category of documents — Evidentiary/Investigative Materials — "includes 
 copies of records or evidence, analysis of that evidence, and derivative communications 
 summarizing or otherwise referencing evidence." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 14) This 
 category includes business records and "documents and evidence provided by witnesses to law 
 enforcement," as well as information regarding those witnesses. ads) 
 The second category of documents — Administrative Materials — consists of 
 internal communications among investigators within the FBI providing updates 
 regarding the status of the investigation, including witness interviews and 
 discussion of evidence gathered during the investigation; communications 
 between the FBI and other government agencies regarding the investigation; 
 grand jury subpoenas identifying the names of witnesses and documents sought 
 during the investigation; and organizational documents such as envelopes used to 
 organize and store documents and other evidentiary documents, bulky exhibit 
 12

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 13 of 20 
 cover sheets, transmittal forms, and letter routing slips, some of which contain the 
 names of witnesses, including victim-witnesses, and subjects of the investigation. 
 (al 15) 
 As for the harm that would result from disclosure of the Evidentiary/Investigative 
 Materials and the Administrative Materials, the FBI states that disclosure would (1) impact 
 witness testimony, (2) impact witnesses' willingness to testify, (3) prejudice the jury pool "so as 
 to hinder the Government's ability to present its case in court,"4 (4) provide Maxwell with 
 greater access "to the investigatory files than she would otherwise have during the criminal 
 4 In connection with its previous summary judgment motion, the FBI described the harm that 
 would result from disclosure as "impair[ing] the Government's (and the defendant's) ability to 
 seat a fair and impartial jury in Maxwell." (First Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 39)11 17-19) In 
 denying the FBI's motion as to Exemption 7(A), this Court noted that "the FBI's concerns 
 regarding the effects of disclosure on jury impartiality are properly raised under Exemption 7(B), 
 and not under Exemption 7(A)." (Summary Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 22 n.10) 
 "Exemption 7(B) applies ... when the disclosure of law enforcement records would deprive a 
 person of the right to 'a fair trial or an impartial adjudication[,]' ... [and] the word `trial' means 
 the ultimate determination of factual and legal claims by judge or jury in a judicial proceeding." 
 Chiquita Brands Int'l Inc. v. S.E.C., 805 F.3d 289, 295 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 
 55 2 0X70)); M km Washington Post Co. v. U.S. Den't of Just., 863 F.2d 96, 101 (D.C. Cir. 
 1988) ("The exemption[] ... was meant to prevent disclosures from conferring an unfair 
 advantage upon one party to an adversary proceeding or leading to prejudicial publicity in 
 pending cases that might inflame jurors or distort administrative judgment."). 
 In connection with its current motion, the FBI states that "the harm the government is 
 articulating through a risk of prejudicing the jury pool is the harm of prejudicing the 
 government's ability to present its criminal case in court." (Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 57) at 17-18 
 (emphasis in original)) In this regard, the Government states that because the "majority of 
 records in this category ... were not admitted into evidence at Maxwell's first trial[,] ... the jury 
 may wonder why those materials were absent from the trial and may suspect the government of 
 trying to hide evidence from the jury, causing jurors to draw an unwarranted adverse inference 
 against the government." (U. at 16 (citing Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 14(c))) 
 Accordingly, the harm now identified by the FBI is not prejudice to the parties' right to a fair and 
 impartial jury, but instead unfair prejudice to the Government in presenting its case. This type of 
 potential harm is properly raised under Exemption 7(A).

 discovery process," and (5) violate the Protective Order entered in the underlying case. (a.% 
 14(a) -(e), 15(a)-(d)) 
 In response, Plaintiffs renew their argument that the FBI has not linked the 
 document categories to any potential harm. (Pkf. Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3) According to Plaintiffs, 
 "the FBI insists that these are simply the kinds of documents that would tend to cause harm if 
 released, without engaging the reality on the ground that the target of the investigation has seen 
 millions of records and was convicted in one of the most high-profile trials in U.S. history." 0j) 
 Plaintiffs also point out that "there is no new substantive factual information offered" in the 
 revised declarations or the FBI's current motion for summary judgment. adj 
 The standard for application of Exemption 7(A) is not whether the "target of the 
 investigation has seen millions of records," however, or whether an agency has proffered 
 "substantive factual information" in support of a claimed exemption. Instead, an agency "must 
 explain to the court how the release of each category would interfere with enforcement 
 proceedings." Tipograph v. Dept of Just., 83 F. Supp. 3d 234, 239 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting 
 Bevis v. Dep't of State 801 F.2d 1386, 1389-90 (D.C.Cir. 1986)). "The agency need not justify 
 the withholding of each document with specific facts," however. Robbins Geller Rudman & 
 Dowd LLP v. United States Sec. & Exch. Comm'n, 419 F. Supp. 3d 523, 530 (E.D.N.Y. 2019). 
 Instead, the agency need only make a showing that "allow[s] the court to be able to `trace a 
 rational link between the nature of the document and the alleged likely interference?" Id. 
 (quoting N.Y. Times Co., 2016 WL 5946711, at *7). 
 The FBI has met that burden here. Unlike in its previous motion (e Summary 
 Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 22-23), the FBI has described the contents of each category and 
 linked specific harms that would result from the public disclosure of the documents in each 
 14 
 EFTA00038665
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 15 of 20 
 category. For example, the FBI has explained that public disclosure of the 
 Evidentiary/Investigative Materials "could influence the testimony of witnesses by providing the 
 opportunity for witnesses to shape their testimony to conform with other evidence gathered 
 during the investigation, including both records and witness statements." (Third Comey Decl. 
 (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 14(a)) Disclosure of the Evidentiary/Investigative Materials could also have a 
 chilling effect on witnesses because "Mhe public release of this information could lead to the 
 identification and intimidation of witnesses, who may decline to cooperate with the parties and 
 be disinclined to testify if their personal information is released to the public." (&l. ¶ 14(b)) 
 Public disclosure could also cause unfair prejudice to the Government at a retrial, based on the 
 fact that certain documents were available to the Government but not offered at the first trial. 
 Finally, public disclosure would provide Maxwell with greater access to investigatory materials 
 than she would otherwise have. a ¶¶ 14(c)-(e), 15(a)-(d)) 
 "Ultimately, an agency's justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient 
 if it appears logical or plausible." Larson v. Dev't of State 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009) 
 (internal citation and quotations omitted). Given the information contained within each category, 
 and the potential harm that could result from public disclosure — as described in the Second 
 Seidel Declaration and the Third Comey Declaration — the FBI has adequately demonstrated the 
 necessary logical and plausible connection between disclosure and harm. 
 Plaintiffs argue, however, that 
 (1) much of the evidence is already the subject of public record from the prior 
 trial and other civil proceedings; (2) much of the evidence is otherwise in the 
 public domain; and (3) the government makes no effort to segregate this material 
 or particularize how the exposure of this material would influence witness 
 testimony. 
 (Pltf. Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3) 
 15 
 EFTA00038666
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 16 of 20 
 The FBI has explained, however, that the exhibits admitted at trial "represent a 
 small fraction of the documents contained in [the Evidentiary/Investigative Materials] category." 
 The Government further represents that it "has made available to the press upon request copies 
 of all publicly admitted exhibits from the trial" and is willing to "provide a copy of those 
 publicly filed exhibits to the Plaintiffs upon request." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59)11 14(f)) 
 In connection with the instant FOIA application, the FBI has also reviewed responsive records 
 "on a document-by-document basis" (Second Seidel Decl. (Mt. No. 58) at 2) and has separated 
 "publicly available news reporting and other open source materials that are already accessible 
 online through public sources" into a third category that "ha[s] already been produced to 
 Plaintiffs." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59)1116) Finally, "an agency may satisfy its burden 
 of proof `by grouping documents in categories and offering generic reasons for withholding the 
 documents in each category.' CREW I.746 F.3d at 1098 (quoting Maydak, 218 F.3d at 765). 
 Where an agency 
 wishes to adopt the generic approach, [it] has a three-fold task. First, it must 
 define its categories functionally. Second, it must conduct a document-by-
 document review in order to assign documents to the proper category. Finally, it 
 must explain to the court how the release of each category would interfere with 
 enforcement proceedings. 
 j4, 746 F.3d at 1098 (quoting Bevis, 801 F.2d at 1389-90). As discussed above, the FBI has 
 "defined its categories fimctionally"; it has performed "a document-by-document review in order 
 to assign documents to the proper category"; and it has explained how the disclosure of each 
 category would interfere with enforcement proceedings. 
 In connection with the harm element, the FBI has explained that the public 
 disclosure of the materials at issue could influence witness testimony by "providing the 
 opportunity for witnesses to shape their testimony to conform with [what is set forth in the non-
 public records]." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶¶ 14(a), 15(a)) "Courts allow withholding 
 16 
 EFTA00038667
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 17 of 20 
 under Exemption 7(A) [where] .. . `[p]ublic disclosure of information could result in destruction 
 of evidence, chilling and intimidation of witnesses, and revelation of the scope and nature of the 
 Government's investigation.' Tipograph, 83 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (quoting Solar Sources. Inc. v. 
 United States, 142 F.3d 1033, 1039 (7th Cir. 1998)). Indeed, "Exemption 7 was designed to 
 prevent harm to the government's case in court by not allowing litigants earlier or greater access 
 to agency investigatory files than they would otherwise have." oCnti, 2014 WL 1274517, at *22 
 (citing Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. at 224-25); see also New York Times, 2016 WL 
 5946711, at 4'13 ("Such explanations are sufficient to establish that the withholdings conceal 
 records compiled for law enforcement purposes that disclose techniques and procedures for law 
 enforcement investigations, and, therefore, justify nondisclosure."). 
 These paradigmatic harms are among the harms that the FBI now alleges would 
 result from disclosure of the Evidentiary/Investigative Materials and the Administrative 
 Materials. While the FBI previously failed to link these potential harms to each document 
 category, it has now done so. There is no need for the FBI to further "particularize how the 
 exposure of this material would influence witness testimony." (PItt Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3) 
 "[T]he record establishes that the release of the requested information could reasonably be 
 expected to cause articulable harm." Cui v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation 551 F. Supp. 3d 4, 24 
 (E.D.N.Y. 2021) 
 This Court concludes that "[t]he [revised] declarations provide[] sufficient detail 
 for the Court to trace a rational link between the information contained in the records and the 
 potential interference with law enforcement proceedings," id. at 24, and the FBI has thus met its 
 burden for withholding disclosure of the records under Exemption 7(A). Because "Exemption 
 17 
 EFTA00038668
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 18 of 20 
 7(A) continues to be accerted to protect all redacted information," (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 
 58)1 8), this Court need not evaluate the applicability of the other Exemptions. 
 SEGREGABILITY 
 "FOIA . provides that [a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be 
 provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.' 
 Conti, 2014 WL 1274517, at *25 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(6)). "[T]he agency must provide a 
 detailed justification for its decision that non-exempt material is not segregable," but "is entitled 
 to a presumption that it complied with its obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material." 
 Id. (citing Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Air Force 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). 
 "[T]o justify withholding an entire document[,] the DOJ ... must demonstrate that [it] cannot 
 delineate between exempt and non-exempt information therein." Avvad v. U.S. Dept. of Justice 
 2002 WL 654133, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2002). 
 Here, the FBI states that it has reviewed responsive records on a "document-by-
 document basis" and conducted a segregability review concerning 11,571 responsive pages. 
 (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58) at 2, 20-21). The FBI further represents that "to the extent 
 there is non-exempt information contained in the records withheld under Exemption 7(A), that 
 information is intertwined with exempt information and cannot reasonably be segregated without 
 risking interference with the Maxwell prosecution, referencing the harms described 
 [previously]." (Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 57) at 30; Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 17) According 
 to the FBI, "[t]he media coverage of speculation and theories about Maxwell's association with 
 Epstein makes the segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult 
 because providing information pertaining to Epstein without complete context can reasonably be 
 18 
 EFTA00038669
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 19 of 20 
 expected to contribute to the dissemination of speculation and theories about the Maxwell case." 
 (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 17) 
 "An agency's explanation that records are exempt in their entirety is sufficient to 
 satisfy its segregability obligations with respect to the documents withheld under Exemption 
 7(A)." New York Times Co. v. United States Dep't of Just., 390 F. Supp. 3d 499, 519 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2019); Stein v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n 266 F. Supp. 3d 326, 353 (D.D.C. 2017) ("[T]he 
 SEC has sufficiently described two categories of documents that it has withheld under 
 Exemption 7(A) in their entirety, and explained that it is not possible to segregate non-exempt 
 information from these documents, except as the Court has described above. This is sufficient to 
 satisfy the agency's segregability obligations with respect to the documents withheld under 
 Exemption 7(A)."); Dillon v. Dep't of Just., 102 F. Supp. 3d 272, 298 (D.D.C. 2015) (concluding 
 that the FBI satisfied its segregability obligation under FOIA by stating that it had "carefully 
 reviewed the material withheld" and explained that "segregability is not possible because [the 
 records] are exempt from disclosure [in their entirety] pursuant to Exemption 7(A)" (second 
 alteration in original)). This Court concludes that the FBI has satisfied its segregability burden 
 with respect to the documents withheld in full under Exemption 7(A).

 . Maxwell

 As I mentioned to M, I think it would be ideal to get formal photos like from a license or passport from the late 1990s or 
 early 2000s for each of these individuals. That way we can use the NYPD database to find fillers who appear similar.

 to Maxwell that we discussed? It would be helpful to understand what the source is of the funds for the transfer. In 
 addition, could you please let me know the bates range for the account documents for this account? I'm having difficulty 
 locating them in the production. If you're able to flag any other KYC documents in the file, that would be extremely 
 helpful. 
 Thanks,

 Subject: RE: signature card 
 Attached are the account documents for the Financial Trust Company. In the production, I did not see a signature card for 
 these accounts. However, there is a J.P. Morgan Entity Resolution form which schedules authorized signers (bates # 1934). 
 If you have any questions, please contact me.

 Hi here. 
 is in an extensive meeting 
 with DCF. She has been given the 
 ultimatum of the case or leaving her 
 children. This new case has caused 
 her to relapse and we are sending 
 her to trauma therapy. She is not 
 mentally able to handle the case 
 and issues with her children right 
 now. Maybe in a month we can try 
 again. But, I am kindly asking that I 
 be notified so I can prepare her. I 
 apologize for any inconvenience. 
 Any questions, please feel free to 
 reach out to me. I am a protector of 
 my children, more so when they are 
 in a crisis situation. 
 rue, Aug 24, 09 34 
 Give me a call when you get this I 
 want to verify that you got my 
 voicemail 
 I'll call you back shortly

 6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
 In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
 recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
 partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
 hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
 recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
 contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
 4. Date Prepared : 
 17/2/2019 
 On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. An arrest warrant has been issued 
 out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York will be sworn out the day of 
 arrest.

 I look forward to hearing from you about the dates amd helping where if I can. 
 Is this something a lawyer is needed for? Sony I have never had to do something like this. I saw the 
 subpoena mentioned I could but wasn't sure if it was necessary or not.

 Hello M, 
 Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your oral 
 surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what everyone's availability is for 
 the next couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide that you prefer to have 
 Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the prosecutors.

 We have a bit of a conflict in timing on our end that I did not initially realize for next Friday. I do 
 apologize but is there any chance you can speak with us earlier that morning (around 10-11am New 
 York time) instead of 2pm? Are you still living in Arizona? If this is too early we can also try and 
 arrange some other timing during the week if you know your work schedule better by now. I don't 
 expect our conversation to be much more than an hour. 
 Sony again and please let me know,

 Hi 
 Glad things have calmed down a bit for you. 
 In general I think it's best for everyone to do this over video conference. It's the fastest and 
 safest way for us to connect in these times. 
 You will not require any special technology or apps to connect. If you have a smart phone or any 
 computer with a camera/ webcam that will work. We will send you a secure email link which will 
 open right up in your web browser. There is an option to download an app on your phone but it's 
 not necessary. 
 I will check with the rest of the team on connecting with you either tomorrow, Monday or 
 Thursday. Mornings work best for you? How's 10 am work on any of those days?

The email says we can have a video conference for a few hours. What type of 
 video/computer capability would I need? 
 Would you rather I speak with Grand Jury in NYC? Do to Covid, I'd rather not come 
 up. 
 Can I meet with the FBI in DC instead? 
 And, if it's possible to do a zoom meeting, I'll be at my computer tomorrow, Monday

 Hi 
 Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to 
 want to do this interview in the safest possible way. 
 Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming 
 time sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to 
 speak with us. In lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date 
 we are still ok with you blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference 
 sometime in near future.

 Ok great. The prosecutors on the case will send out an email invite to you for the meeting which will 
 include them, myself and another agent. There will be a link in the email with instructions how to join 
 the meeting. 
 In my experience it's generally easier if you have a laptop with a camera. When you open the email 
 you will have the option to just click on a link which will open the meeting up in your web browser. 
 If you choose to do it in your phone the link in your email may prompt you to download "cisco WebEx" 
 app. 
 Either way we can walk you through it on Monday. See you then.

 Hello M, 
 Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from 
 your oral surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what 
 everyone's availability is for the next couple of weeks and we will go from 
 there. If you decide that you prefer to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have 
 her reach out to either myself or the prosecutors.

 I've thought about it, and I think I'd like to hear what the lawyers say before I I agree to an interview, 
 and for me to ask some questions etc. 
 I am available in the morning on Thursday at 6am TX time, or tomorrow morning at 11am TX time, or I 
 can do a Wednesday morning time if those don't work?

 Hi M, 
 I'm on vacation with my husband now, and think in the next couple of weeks it will be a 
 problem because my first cousin (who is like a sister) is in hospice. So sad as she is so 
 young. 
 The last week of January should be fine. Do you you have time then?

 Dear Mi 
 My client has been in contact regarding the possibility of an interview to take place in London. Please 
 note that my client is entitled to automatic anonymity under UK Statute as herself a victim of sexual 
 assault that occurred in the UK and she does not waive her right to that anonymity. 
 I very much look forward to hearing from you in order that we may set up a convenient time for you to 
 meet with my client but perhaps before that it would be useful if you could confirm the parameters of 
 your interest in my client. 
 A call may be a good idea.

 Hi 
 So sorry to hear about your cousin. This interview can certainly wait until the last week of 
 January. Take this time to be with her and enjoy your vacation. 
 Let's schedule a date for that week and I'll send out a calendar invite. How's Tuesday the 26th in 
 the afternoon work for you? Feel free to throw out another day or time if that's no good. As of 
 now we are mostly available that week.

 In general I think it's best for everyone to do this over video conference. It's the fastest and 
 safest way for us to connect in these times. 
 You will not require any special technology or apps to connect. If you have a smart phone or any 
 computer with a camera/ webcam that will work. We will send you a secure email link which will 
 open right up in your web browser. There is an option to download an app on your phone but it's

 I very much look forward to hearing from you in order that we may set up a convenient time for

 Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your oral

 to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the

Things have calmed down a bit here and I have time to get back to you. 
 A couple of questions: 
 The email says we can have a video conference for a few hours. What type of 
 video/computer capability would I need? 
 Would you rather I speak with Grand Jury in NYC? Do to Covid, I'd rather not come 
 up. 
 Can I meet with the FBI in DC instead? 
 And, if it's possible to do a zoom meeting, I'll be at my computer tomorrow, Monday 
 and Thursday morning. Please let me know ASAP as I have to arrange my 
 schedule.

 Hi 
 Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to 
 want to do this interview in the safest possible way. 
 Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming 
 time sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to 
 speak with us. In lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date 
 we are still ok with you blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference 
 sometime in near future.

 Hello again, 
 I just wanted to reach out to see if I should still expect someone to contact me. I know it's only been a few days 
 since you've last contacted me but I've started to have second thoughts and I'm getting paranoid about my 
 safety. Im sure it's just in my head but I've been targeted by him in the past so it wouldn't be that far fetched. I 
 know he's dead but i didn't realize how far stretching this was until after I reached out. I just don't want to 
 chicken out. 
 I've seen on tv that others have come forward and I know the attorneys are busy. So I'm not even sure if they'll 
 want to speak with me or they have gathered enough from the others. As I mentioned, this whole thing gives 
 me a paralyzing amount of anxiety and fear... so I figured I'd email you to see if you can provide me with more 
 information. 
 If they don't plan on contacting me, I can go back to pretending this all never happened. If they do, lye thought 
 about it and I'm willing to speak with them using whatever communication method is the safest. 
 Thanks,

 Glad things have calmed down a bit for you. 
 In general I think its best for everyone to do this over video conference. It's the fastest and safest 
 way for us to connect in these times. 
 You will not require any special technology or apps to connect. If you have a smart phone or any 
 computer with a camera/ webcam that will work. We will send you a secure email link which will open 
 right up in your web browser. There is an option to download an app on your phone but it's not

 Hey

My life pretty much crumbled after that. And by the time I pulled myself together, it was too late to do 
 anything about it... Or at least I felt it was. I had done such a good job, eradicating anything associated with 
 that part of my life and scrubbing my mind of the memories that I no longer remembered the details like the 
 name of the girl that invited me along and introduced me to the person who assaulted me as well as the name 
 or location of the venue. So I did nothing... 
 A few months ago, I saw Epstein's face on the news and I put everything altogether... I was sexually 
 assaulted by Jeffery Epstein. 
 He's dead now... so I'm not really sure why I'm emailing or even bringing it up now but I just felt like I 
 should let someone know. If I can be of help in anyway, I'd like to be. However, I don't really have proof 
 and I can't really offer anything as far as Maxwell's case goes. She could have been there as well as I do 
 remember there being a "woman" there along with numerous other "girls". I remember making a mental note 
 to myself how it was weird that there that I was probably the oldest one out of the girls that were there except 
 for the one woman that was sitting with the other men. 
 Anyway, for now, I'd prefer to talk via email but if it makes sense, I'd be okay chatting with you in the future 
 if you think it makes sense. Again, I'm not sure if I can be of any help or if it even makes sense to reach out 
 anymore... but I just felt like I'd never forgive myself if I stayed silent again this time. 
 Thank you.

 Do you have a law enforcement contact or know someone at AT&T? I'm trying to get some records quickly and just seeing 
 if there is someone I could speak to direct. If not, no worries.

 Importance: High 
 The FAA has previously received FOIA requests seeking historical flight data for aircraft owned or operated by Jeffrey 
 Epstein, specifically N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N120JE and these are FOIA requests for which we have consulted with 
 the FBI. One of those requesters, Angela Wang from Business Insider, submitted two requests in 2020 that sought the 
 fl ight records for those four aircraft from January 1, 1990 to July 6, 2019. Both times, she was denied those records under 
 exemption 7A because of the FBI's criminal investigation. Ms. Wang recently published an article (see link below) in which 
 she references another FOIA request which sought all aircraft flights that are stored in the FAA Traffic Flow Management 
 System (TFMS) repository, which is where the FAA stores historical flight data. The records that were released in response 
 to that FOIA request inadvertently included flights involving N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N1201E. We have implemented 
 measures to keep flight data from being released for N908JE, N9091E, N212JE, and N1201E in response to future FOIA 
 requests that seek the entire TFMS repository.

Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an 
 Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas 
 approved each year and the timeframe. 
 I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?

 Hi and 
 I hope that you are both doing well. I am in the final (hopefully!) few days of COVID recovery. Thank goodness for 
 vaccinations! 
 Sanctuary for Families is working with for a T-Visa application. In that regard, they have requested a 
 letter/statement from your office regarding certain information. 
 Please let me know the best way of handling this (who to work with, best way to communication info, etc). 
 We really appreciate everything that you have done and your willingness to help finally move on with her life and 
 heal. 
 I look forward to hearing from you.

 I am so glad that this matter has come to an end and that they recently spoke

 Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an 
 Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas 
 approved each year and the timeframe. 
 I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?
