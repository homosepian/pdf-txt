 The Firm will provide those legal services reasonably required to represent the Client including fad 
 and law investigation, drafting pleadings, settlement efforts, and other services up to and including 
 trial. The Firm will take reasonable steps to keep the Client informed of material developments and 
 timely respond to Client inquiries. 
 The Firm is representing the Client only in the matters described above, appellate services arc outside 
 the scope of this Agreement and a separate written agreement for appellate services or in any other 
 matter will be required. The Firm cannot provide the Client with tax advice and the Client is 
 encouraged to consult with tax advisors concerning this matter, particularly in the event of 
 settlement or other monetary resolution. 
 2, CLIENT'S DUTIES 
 Th e Client agrees to be truthful with the Firm, to keep the Firm informed of any information or 
 developments which may come to the Client's attention, to advise the Firm of all relevant 
 information and any change in contact information, and to abide by this Agreement. The Client will 
 assist the Firm by providing necessary information and documents and, to the extent practicable, 
 locating witnesses. The Client agrees to appear at all necessary proceedings and to cooperate fully 
 with the Firm in all matters related to the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of the Claim(s). 
 The Client understands that this representation and the resolution of the Claims is likely to be 
 complicated and time-consuming (including time-consuming of the Client's time). While the Firm 
 will attempt to keep the Client apprised of material developments, the Firm cannot predict with any 
 certainty the outcome or timing of these matters. 
 3. ATTORNEY'S FEE 
 The Attorney's Fee to be paid to the Firm for work on the Claims is contingent on the result. The amount 
 of the Attorney's Fee is different depending on the type of Claim(s) asserted. As to any Claims

 Federal Bureau of Investigation, if the Claims arc resolved before a lawsuit is filed, the Client shall pay 
 the Finn an attorney's fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of any Amount Recovered. Once a lawsuit 
 is filed on a Client's behalf, the Client shall pay the Firm an attorney's fee equal to twenty-five 
 percent (25%) of any Amount Recovered. As to any other Claims, regardless of the nature of the 
 Claim, when the Claim is resolved, or the type of suit (such as an individual or class action), the 
 Client shall pay the Firm an attorney's fee equal to one-third (331/394) of the "Amount Recovered." 
 If there is no Amount Recovered, the Client will have no responsibility to repay the "Firm for Costs, 
 Disbursements, and Litigation Expenses" ("Expenses"). If there is an Amount Recovered but the

 Re: Retention of Marsh Law Firm PI I.0 
 Dear 
 Thank you for speaking with me about your potential claims. We arc honored that you have chosen 
 our firm to help guide you in your path to justice and resolution. In our experience, it is useful to 
 outline our professional relationship in written agreements, and court rules often require them. 
 Please review these agreements carefully. We realize that much of the information may be unfamiliar 
 or confusing, and hiring an attorney may not be a common event, so if you have any questions or 
 comments please let us know. 
 There are two agreements you need to review and sign for us to represent you: (1) the Legal Services 
 Agreement, and (2) the Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement. Once you are satisfied 
 with the Agreements, please follow the prompts to sign, initial where needed, and return to us. 
 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to the 
 prospect of working with you. 
 Very truly yours,

 Marsh Law Firm ("Firm") and ("Client") (the Firm and Client 
 together are the "Parties", the Firm or Client individually is a "Party") hereby agree that the Firm will 
 provide legal services to the Client on the terms set forth below. 
 I. SCOPE OF LEGAL SERVICES 
 The Client hires the Firm to provide legal services concerning any and all past, present, and future 
 legal causes of adion or claims associated with, corollary to. or arising from any and all allegations or 
 instances of sexual abuse involving the Client and Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell. and/or any 
 others participating in or in any way connected to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking insofar as those 
 causes of action or claims arc against or involve the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department 
 of Justice, and/or other city, state, and/or federal government entities' failure to investigate Jeffrey 
 Epstein and his co-conspirators.. This includes all causes of action or claims—including criminal, 
 civil, and other—arising from these allegations or instances, whether in connedion with one or more 
 individual or multi-party case(s) or class aCtion(s). These causes of adion and claims are defined 
 collectively as the "Claims." 
 The Client has not retained any other attomey(s) in connection with the Claims. The Client 
 previously retained counsel to pursue claims against the Epstein estate, JP Morgan/Deutsche Bank. 
 and perhaps others relating to Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The retention of those attorneys 
 has either been concluded or do not encompass/apply to the Claims. 
 Although we arc not currently aware of claims relating to your image(s), in the event that such claims 
 exist, the Client also hires the Firm to provide legal services concerning all past, present, and future 
 legal causes of action or claims associated with, corollary to, or arising from all photographic, digital, 
 fi lm or any other image(s) or likeness of the Client located anywhere worldwide. This includes all 
 legal causes of adion—including copyright, tort. equity, and civil—arising from the creation, 
 distribution, and possession of the Client's child sex abuse material ("CSAM"), images, videos, or 
 likeness by any person, corporation, or other public, private, or nonprofit entity or syndicate 
 anywhere in the world. 
 The phrase "legal causes of adion" also includes, if applicable, all restitution requested. ordered, or 
 paid which is associated with, corollary to, or arising from any actual or potential criminal cause of 
 action in which the Client is, could, or might be named a victim. These causes of adion and claims 
 are also included in the "Claims."

 parking, mileage, transportation, airfare, meals and incidentals, and hotel costs; investigation 
 expenses; consultants, expert witness, professional mediator, arbitrator and/or special master fees; 
 postage (at cost); and computerized legal research. Expenses also include the cost of retaining 
 specialized legal counsel necessary for the Firm to pursue the Client's Claims including, for example, 
 bankruptcy counsel and trusts and estates counsel. 
 Expenses also include the cost of investigators, consultants, and expert witnesses. The Firm will seleU 
 the expert witnesses, consultants, and investigators, and notify the Client of the individuals or firms 
 hired and, where feasible, an estimation of their charges. 
 If there are multiple ongoing and potential future cases concerning the Claims, the Client 
 acknowledges that the Firm may retain some or all of the Amount Recovered in one case in order to 
 pay past and current Expenses as well as retaining funds for future Expenses.

 LITIGATION EXPENSES. 2 
 SANCTIONS 
 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement whether express or implied, the Client agrees 
 that any award of attorney's fees or Expenses, whether by settlement, mediation, arbitration award, 
 judgment, or otherwise, belongs exclusively to the Firm. The receipt of awarded attorney's fees or 
 Expenses will be credited against the total amount owed by the Client under this Agreement. 
 Therefore, the Client agrees that the attorney's fees and Expenses payable to the Firm pursuant to this 
 Agreement shall be the greater of: (i) the amount otherwise owed to the Firm under this Agreement; 
 or (ii) the amount of the awarded attorney's fees and Expenses. 
 Th e Client agrees that any attorney's fees or Expenses awarded as part of discovery or other 
 extraordinary motion praaicc or sanaions proceedings is not considered part of the Amount 
 Recovered and belongs exclusively to the Firm as additional compensation for extraordinary time and 
 effort. 
 NOTE: If an award of attorney's fees or Expenses is received or sought on the Client's behalf, the 
 Client understands that the amount awarded is the amount the court, mediator, or arbitrator believes 
 the party is entitled to recover. This does not determine the amount of attorney's fees or Expenses the 
 Firm is entitled to charge the Client, or that only the attorney's fees and Expenses which arc awarded 
 are reasonable. 
 9. CLIENT APPROVAL NECESSARY FOR SETTLEMENT 
 The Client has the right to accept or rejeU any settlement or compromise of the Claims. The Firm 
 will not settle or compromise any of the Claims without the Client's prior approval. Once the Client 
 agrees to a settlement, the Client authorizes the Firm and grants the Firm a limited power of attorney

 2. IOINT REPRESENTATION 
 The Client consents to the Firm representing others who have claims which arc similar or identical to 
 the Client's Claims, induding others who have claims against one or more of the same defendants as 
 Client. The Client authorizes the Firm to disclose any Client's pseudonym to the other Clients. 
 i. JOINT PROSECUTION 
 The Client consents to Client's claims being joined with those of other Clients in one or more 
 lawsuits, actions, or claim resolution processes. 
 4. CONFLICTS
 The Client acknowledges that the Firm may represent others who have claims against one or more of 
 the same defendants as Client. The Client waives any conflicts of interest that may arise in this 
 situation, including any conflict that could result from Client and the Firm's other clients each 
 pursuing a financial recovery from one or more of the same defendants. The Client also recognizes 
 that circumstances might arise in which the Firm may be prevented or disqualified from representing 
 the Client in a particular case or cases. The Firm will promptly inform the Client of any such 
 situation that may require such withdrawal. By signing below, the Client acknowledges these risks 
 and consents to such waiver and withdrawal. 
 Furthermore, in the event the Client at any time and for any reason elects to discontinue its 
 engagement of the Firm, or if an adverse relationship arises between the Client and any of the Finn's 
 other clients, the Client acknowledges and agrees that the Firm may continue without restriction to 
 represent the Firm's other clients in any and all matters, including those that rise from or relate to 
 any case, including the case in which the conflict(s) arose. 
 5. DECISION MAKING 
 The Client understands that many of the decisions during the course of the representation are 
 tactical and will be made by the Finn. On occasion, decisions will need to be made jointly by the 
 Client and the Firm's other clients. Certain other decisions will be made by each of the individual 
 clients in consultation with the Firm. Client understands that he or she will always retain the 
 authority to decide whether to settle or otherwise resolve his or her individual claim. 
 6. SETTLEMENT STRATEGY AND COMMON FUND SETTLEMENT 
 The Client understands that it is unlikely that any two cases will have the same value, either for 
 settlement or at trial. Every case has different facts, strengths, weaknesses, and risks, and the Client 
 understands that at trial or in settlement negotiations. the Firm, in consultation with its clients, may 
 assign a value to each client's claim and is likely to assign a higher value to some claims than to 
 others. The Client understands that a judge, a bankruptcy judge, a bankruptcy trustee, a jury, or any 
 neutral third party who helps resolve the Client's case might, for purposes of convenience, minimize 
 the differences among different plaintiffs. Moreover, for purposes of settlement, defendants might do 
 the same.

 each individual client and will endeavnr tn tin gn with each clime( rate net:int-impel tenararelv—hated

 story, it will be very hard to argue that everyone's story is untrue. (For a good example. read New 
 York Magazine's 'I'm No Longer Afraid: 35 Women Tell Their Stories About Being Assaulted by Bill 
 Cosli and the Culture That Wouldn't Listen htipslitinytirl tom/ i5(:osbyAceters). 
 Furthermore, if the jury hears multiple cases where the abuse survivor failed for many years to fully 
 confront the effects of the abuse, it will help them understand that common phenomenon. Likewise, 
 defendants are more likely to lack credibility with a jury. for example. when arguing they should not 
 have realized victims were in danger in the face of overwhelming evidence that multiple victims were 
 being abused by the same person(s). Lastly. the stronger a case becomes, the more likely the 
 defendant will agree to a reasonable and early settlement. 
 If you decide not to join forces with other plaintiffs, we will still try to offer evidence from other 
 abuse survivors for the reasons described above, but the defendant(s) will most likely vigorously try 
 to exclude that evidence. On some level, having multiple plaintiffs in the same case makes it easier 
 for the judge to see why the evidence should be admitted. 
 REASONS AGAINST JOINING MULTIPLE PLAINTIFFS IN THE SAME CASE 
 It is possible that a weak case or unsympathetic plaintiff will drag down other stronger cases or more 
 sympathetic plaintiffs. No two cases have the same value, same losses, or same damages, which is why 
 our Firm has generally recommended against class action lawsuits in child sex abuse cases, at least as 
 to damages. Thus, a person with a particularly strong case may not want his or her case "diluted" by 
 weaker cases. In addition, joining together in one case puts everyone's "eggs in one basket." Although 
 juries are instructed to consider each case on its own merits, something bad about one of the 
 plaintiffs could negatively affect all of the plaintiffs. 
 In addition, each plaintiff loses some measure of control over their individual case and over the 
 aggregate costs. While you always have the right to decide whether to resolve your case, such as 
 whether to accept a settlement or whether to go through a jury trial, some procedural decisions will 
 likely have to be made by a vote. There may be many such decisions during a case and there may be 
 possible disagreement and hurt feelings. You must agree in advance to participate in joint decision 
 making and to abide by decisions that you might not agree with. 
 In addition, there is always the risk that a jury might have difficulty keeping the facts straight if it 
 hears evidence about multiple plaintiffs in the same case. 
 Lastly, when you join with other plaintiffs, it is possible that the resolution of your case might be 
 delayed by a development in one or more of the other cases. 
 OUR REASONS FOR REPRESENTING MULTIPLE CLIENTa 
 One advantage of representing multiple clients is that the work of our Firm will benefit multiple 
 people at the same time. For example, we often spend considerable time and resources working to 
 fi nd evidence to hold the defendant(s) liable for what our clients endured. Similarly, we often find

 breaches of confidentiality. security, and other such risks commonly associated with such 
 technologies which are beyond the Firm's reasonable control. 
 15. DISCHARGE AND WITHDRAWAL 
 Th e Client may discharge the Firm at any time. The Client expressly consents to the Firm 
 unilaterally withdrawing at any time and for any reason in accordance with attorney ethics, 
 professional rules of conduct, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. 
 Among the circumstances under which Firm may withdraw are: (a) with the consent of the Client; 
 (b) the Client's conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the Firm to carry out the representation 
 effectively; and (c) the Client fails to pay Expenses as required by this Agreement. 
 Notwithstanding the Client's notice of discharge, and without regard to the reasons for the Firm's 
 withdrawal or Client's discharge, the Client remains obligated to pay the Firm for Expenses incurred 
 prior to the withdrawal or discharge and, in the event that there is any Amount Recovered after the 
 withdrawal or discharge, the Client remains obligated to pay the Firm Attorney's Fee from the 
 effective date of this Agreement to the date of discharge. If the Firm withdraws without cause, the 
 Firm waives and will not be entitled to recover any Attorney's Fee. 
 The Client understands that this representation and the resolution of the Claims is likely to be 
 complicated and time-consuming (including time-consuming of the Client's time). While the Firm 
 will attempt to keep the Client apprised of material developments, the Finn cannot predict with any 
 certainty the outcome or timing of these matters. 
 16. CONCLUSION OF SERVICES 
 The Client may have access to the Client's case file at any reasonable time. At the end of the 
 engagement, the Client may request the Client's case file. If the Client has not requested the Client's 
 fi le, and to the extent the Firm has not otherwise delivered it or disposed of it consistent with the 
 Client's instructions, the Firm will retain the case file for a period of three years after which the Firm 
 is authorized to destroy the case file. If the Client wants the Firm to maintain the case file for more 
 than three years after the Firm's services have concluded, a separate written agreement must be 
 executed between the Firm and the Client which may include the expense of maintaining or 
 transferring the case file. The Firm is authorized to retain copies of the case file in perpetuity at the 
 Firm's expense.

 Amount Recovered is less than the Expenses, the Client will have no responsibility to repay the Firm 
 for the difference. 
 4. AMOUNT RECOVF.RED 
 The "Amount Recovered" is defined as the gross recovery or total amount paid or received 
 concerning the Claims whether by settlement, mediation, arbitration award. judgment. or otherwise, 
 before deducting any Expenses, taxes, or liens. 
 If there is an Amount Recovered, the Attorney's Fee shall be paid to the Firm at the following time, 
 whichever is earlier: (a) no later than the time when payment is made to the Client or (b) the earliest 
 time when payment is offered or otherwise made available to the Client. (For example, if the Client 
 decides to receive installment payments or a structured settlement rather than a lump sum amount. 
 or if the Client elects to defer payment into a later year, the Firm will nonetheless have the option of 
 receiving the Firm's payment in a lump sum at the earliest time such amount is otherwise available to 
 the Client). 
 The Amount Recovered may be in the form of money or non-monetary proceeds which includes, 
 but is not limited to, the provision of benefits or other forms of compensation, recovery on 
 insurance, stock, stock options. real property costs as taxed on a judgment (including interest), and 
 any other item of value. To the extent the Amount Recovered includes items of value that are not 
 cash, the Client agrees that the Firm has the option of receiving all or some of the Attorney's Fee in 
 the form of either the item of value or its cash equivalent. 
 The following or similar items are not considered Expenses: liens, assignments, and claims in favor of 
 hospitals, medical care, and mental health treatment, and reimbursements to self-insurers or 
 insurance carriers. If applicable, such items will he paid from Client's net share of the Amount 
 Recovered. 
 The Client agrees that the Amount Recovered will be paid directly to the Firm and deposited in the 
 Firm's client trust account from which the Firm may immediately deduct the Attorney's Fee and any 
 Expenses and then distribute to the Client, no sooner than ten business days after receipt, the 
 Client's portion of the Amount Recovered. In addition. to the extent applicable, feasible, and 
 permissible, and at the Finn's sole election, the Firm may receive the Attorney's Fee either in an 
 immediate lump sum, in future periodic payments. or in any combination of a lump sum and future 
 periodic payments. The Client agrees to cooperate with the Firm by endorsing and executing any 
 documents required to achieve this outcome. The Firm's right to coiled payment of its Attorney's Fee 
 cannot be otherwise assigned, transferred, pledged, or encumbered. Neither the Client nor the Firm

 OVERVIEW OF THE JOINT REPRESENTATION AND PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
 Th e Marsh Law Firm PLLC has and will continue to represent survivors of childhood and adult 
 sexual abuse and exploitation. The Firm's clients may, from time to time, be filing claims, including 
 civil lawsuits, against one or more of the same defendants. We recommend that, where feasible, your 
 claims be joined in the claims or lawsuits with one or more of our clients who are pursuing claims or 
 lawsuits against one or more of the same defendants. This requires a joint representation agreement 
 and an understanding of the joint prosecution of claims. 
 There are potential conflicts of interest that an arise when an attorney represents more than one 
 client with claims against the same defendant(s). Potential conflicts may also arise from joining the 
 claims of several clients in the same lawsuit or claim resolution process. We are required by the rules 
 of professional conduct that govern lawyers to fully disclose these risks and to obtain your consent 
 before we can represent you. This is required even if there is no actual current conflict of interest. 
 There are also tactical reasons for and against both joint representation and joint prosecution. This 
 overview discusses the potential conflicts and the pros and cons of both joint representation and 
 joint prosecution. 
 We believe that, on balance, your case will be strengthened by joining forces with our other clients 
 who arc pursuing claims or lawsuits against one or more of the same defendants. You arc encouraged 
 to consult with another lawyer to review this issue before you make a decision. We recommend this 
 because our advice concerning this issue could appear to be affected by the fact that we will 
 potentially benefit from having additional clients. You should be totally comfortable and make an 
 informed decision on this issue. 
 Th ere are two separate but related issues you need to decide: 
 whether you will retain our law firm despite our representation of others with claims or lawsuits 
 against one or more of the same defendants; and 
 if you do retain our firm, whether you will join forces with others? 
 It is impossible to anticipate every possibility. Therefore. the pros and cons discussed in this overview 
 are illustrations based on our experience. There are undoubtedly other reasons, both for and against, 
 joint prosecution and joint representation that we have not anticipated, but we believe this overview 
 addresses the material pros and cons. 
 REASONS IN FAVOR OF JOINING MULTIPLE CLIENTS IN THE SAME CASE 
 Some of the entities and individuals involved with sexual abuse are rich and powerful. When several 
 individuals band together, it helps compensate for that wealth and power; you arc stronger when you 
 are part of a group than you are alone. If multiple abuse survivors are plaintiffs in the same case, each 
 plaintiff's story reinforces the story of every other plaintiff. While it might be possible to believe that 
 one person made up his story, when three or four or more victims come forward with the same basic 
 story, it will be very hard to argue that everyone's story is untrue. (For a good example, read New

 The Firm shall rake no role whatsoever in the arbitration other than to provide the arbitrator(s) with 
 neutral and objective information and copies of documents and other requested material. The Firm 
 cannot represent any client in the arbitration, cannot provide advice to any client concerning the 
 outcome of the arbitration, and cannot tender any opinion regarding any such outcome. 
 The Clients participating in arbitration shall share equally in the costs of the arbitration, and the 
 Firm is authorized to compensate the arbitrator(s) from the clients' recovery in the case. 
 The Client confirms that he or she has read and understands this section and voluntarily agrees to 
 binding arbitration. In doing so, the Client is voluntarily giving up important constitutional rights 
 to trial by judge or jury. as well as rights to appeal the arbitration decision. The Client may consult 
 with an independent lawyer of the Client's choice to review these arbitration provisions, and this 
 entire agreement, prior to signing this Agreement. 
 IL COST SHARING 
 The Firm is authorized to incur Expenses (as defined and provided in the Legal Services Agreement 
 between the Firm and the Client) for the prosecution of each of their clients cases as they deem 
 reasonable. necessary, and appropriate. 
 Each client is responsible for Expenses incurred in the prosecution of his or her case as reflected in 
 the Legal Services Agreement between each client and the Firm. The Client understands that some 
 Expenses will be jointly incurred by the Firm for the benefit of some or all Clients, and as to those 
 Expenses. each benefiting client will be responsible for that client's proportionate share of such 
 Expenses. 
 "Joint Expenses" are those Expenses that benefit more than one client to a significant degree. For 
 example. many filing fees and depositions costs are Joint Expenses that will often significantly benefit 
 each client who is joined together in the same case. 
 "Individual Expenses" are those Expenses that benefit only one client or one client to a significant 
 degree. For example, the cost to obtain the records of a particular client and the cost of a client's 
 deposition are Individual Expenses that will often significantly benefit only one client. 
 The Firm shall make an initial allocation of all Expenses, including whether an Expense is Joint or 
 Individual and, if Joint, whether it will be shared by all Clients or some clients. A client may object 
 to an allocation. If the Firm and the client(s) cannot agree on the allocation of Expenses, the client 
 may request, and the Firm will agree to, mediation. This paragraph does not waive any right any 
 client may have to a judicial accounting. 
 9. CONFIDENTIALITY 
 In the course of any cast, some of the Firm's jointly represented Clients may need to meet and 
 communicate with the Firm either individually or in a group. The Client understands that such 
 communication is highly confidential and that any breach of confidentiality can prejudice other

 CONCLUSION 
 Weighing all of these factors, we strongly believe that the advantages of joining together the claims of 
 multiple clients, and jointly representing multiple clients, outweigh the potential disadvantages. In 
 addition, since our firm has a great deal of experience representing survivors of sexual abuse and 
 exploitation, we believe there are distinct advantages to our firm representing multiple abuse 
 survivors, including yourself. 
 Please review the Joint Representation Agreement and this analysis carefully, ask any questions, and 
 consider our advice that you consult with another attorney concerning the issues raised both by our 
 representation of multiple clients and by joining multiple clients in the same case. If you agree with 
 the terms of the agreement and have carefully considered the issues in this overview please review 
 and sign the following Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement and return this entire 
 document to our office. 
 JOINT REPRESENTATION AND PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
 J. INTRODUCTION 
 This is an agreement ("Agreement") between ("Client") and the 
 Marsh Law Firm PLLC ("the Firm"), and between the Client and other clients of the Firm who have 
 claims against any and/or all individuals and/or entities arising from the same conduct fin which the 
 Firm is representing Client under the Legal Services Agreement between Client and the Firm. 
 References to the "Firm" include any other attorney the Firm associates with in the course of 
 representing the Client. References to "Clients" include the Client and other parties the Firm may 
 represent now or in the future who have claims arising from the same conduct for which the Firm is 
 representing Client under the Legal Services Agreement between Client and the Firm. 
 This Agreement will be effective with the date the Finn's first perform services. Notwithstanding 
 the foregoing, this Agreement will not take effect, and the Firm will have no obligation to provide 
 services until the Client provides the Firm with a signed copy of this Agreement. 
 The Client has engaged the Firm to represent the Client in pursuing the claims outlined in the Legal 
 Services Agreement signed by the Client (-Claims"). The Client consents to Client's Claims being 
 joined in the same lawsuits, actions, or claim resolution processes with those of one or more of the 
 Firm's other clients. The Client understands that joint representation by the same attorneys may have 
 both advantages and disadvantages. Likewise, the Client understands that joining Client's Claims 
 with those of other clients may have both advantages and disadvantages. The Client acknowledges 
 that the Client has reviewed and understands the foregoing Overview of the Joint Representation 
 and Prosecution Agreement that outlines various conflicts of interest that might arise and reasons for 
 and against joint prosecution and joint representation.

 The Client and the Firm agree that it is generally desirable to conduct settlement negotiations for 
 each individual client and will endeavor to do so with each client's case negotiated separately—based 
 on its own unique strengths and weaknesses—and not linked to the settlement of any other client's 
 case. 
 No dient may interfere with any other client's right to settle. The Client recognizes, however, that it 
 is possible that an aggregate settlement might be in every Clients' interest, with a single lump sum 
 fund shared by all Clients, or a joint-fund settlement with a lump sum shared by two or more 
 Clients. Any two or more Clients may agree to enter into a joint-fund settlement. Neither an 
 aggregate settlement nor a joint-fund settlement may be imposed upon any client. Any one client 
 may choose to take his or her case to trial even though every other client chooses to settle in advance 
 of trial. The Client understands that each client has the power and right to prevent an aggregate 
 settlement that would settle the Client's claim. 
 In the event of an aggregate or joint-hind settlement, the participating Clients may decide among 
 themselves as to how the fund shall be allocated. An allocation may not be imposed on any client, 
 except by Arbitration under Section 6 of this Agreement. The Firm shall have no role whatsoever in 
 the allocation decision and cannot represent any client, including Client, in that process. The Client 
 and the other Clients may. however, be represented by other counsel. lithe participating Clients 
 cannot decide upon an allocation, the allocation decision shall be submitted to final and binding 
 arbitration as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement. 
 7. ARBITRATION 
 In the event that arbitration as provided for in this agreement is necessary, it shall be conducted as 
 follows: 
 Except as provided below, the arbitrator shall be chosen at random from a list of qualified mediators. 
 If the first name declines to serve, the second name shall be the chosen arbitrator. If he or she 
 declines to serve, the third name drawn shall be the chosen arbitrator. 
 Th e Clients in arbitration may determine, by a two-thirds vote, to have the arbitration conducted by 
 a panel of three arbitrators whose decisions shall be made by a majority of the panel. In such a 
 situation, six names shall be chosen at random from a list of qualified mediators with the first three 
 names becoming the arbitration panel. If any of the first three names declines to serve, an additional 
 name shall be selected at random from the list of qualified mediators. 
 Th e form and rules governing the arbitration shall be at the sole discretion of the arbitrator(s). The 
 decision of the arbitrator(s) will be final and cannot be appealed. except for misconduct by the 
 arbitrator(s). 
 The Client may be represented by independent counsel at the arbitration.

 shall otherwise agree to settle, sell, or transfer any Claim without first obtaining the consent of the 
 other. 
 S. JOINT REPRESENTATION AND DIVISION OF ATTORNEY'S FEE 
 The Client agrees that the Firm may seled and associate with other attorneys to assist in the 
 representation ("Associated Attorney"), for example to bring legal proceedings in jurisdiaions where 
 Firm attorneys arc not licensed. The Attorney's Fee will not increase by reason of this association. The 
 Associated Attorney will receive a portion of the Attorney's Fee based on the rime expended and 
 services provided by the Associated Attorney. 
 6. CONFLICTS WAIVER 
 The Client acknowledges that the Firm and the Associated Attorney(s) may represent other viOims 
 and plaintiffs and may seek recoveries on behalf of such other viOims and plaintiffs from one or 
 more of the same defendants that the Firm, and Associated Attorney(s) are seeking recovery from on 
 the Client's behalf. The Client hereby waives in advance any conflict that may arise in this 
 siruation(s). The Client also recognizes that circumstances might arise in which the Firm or 
 Associated Attorney(s) may be prevented or disqualified from representing the Client in a particular 
 case or cases. The Firm will promptly inform the Client of any such situation that may require such 
 withdrawal in whole or in part. By signing this Agreement, the Client expressly acknowledges these 
 risks and consents to such waiver and withdrawal. 
 Furthermore, in the event the Client at any time and for any reason eleas to discharge the Firm, or if 
 an adverse relationship arises between the Client and any of the Firm's other clients, the Client 
 acknowledges, agrees, and consents that the Firm may continue without restriction to represent the 
 Firm's other client(s) in any and all matters, induding those that arise from or relate to any Claim(s), 
 including the Claim(s) in which the confliO arose. 
 7. COSTS, DISBURSEMENTS, AND LITIGATION EXPENSES 
 Th e Firm may incur various costs and litigation expenses in performing legal services under this 
 Agreement. The Client agrees to pay all costs, disbursements, and litigation expenses paid or owed by 
 the Client in connexion with the Claim(s), or which have been advanced by the Firm on the Client's 
 behalf and which have not been previously paid or reimbursed to the Firm (colledively "Expenses"). 
 Unless otherwise determined by the court, costs, disbursements, and litigation expenses commonly 
 include court fees; jury fees; service of process charges; court and deposition reporters fees; 
 transcripts; interpreter/translator fees; photocopying reprodudion costs and printing; notary fees; 
 messenger and other delivery fees; postage; deposition costs; reasonable travel expenses including

 that one client's story benefits another client, such as a client who will testify that he or she 
 complained to a defendant that children were in danger but nothing was done. 
 Another advantage of representing multiple clients, as opposed to each having separate counsel or 
 each filing their own separate lawsuit, is sharing costs. Many costs can be shared, such as court filing 
 fees, deposition costs, and travel expenses, while some costs, such as individual psychological 
 evaluations or other costs associated with proving individual damages and losses, are not shred. 
 Likewise, the prosecution of the case will be more efficient and more consistent if it is not run by a 
 group of attorneys each with his or her own client and his or her own strategy. 
 It's also possible that clients who the Firm has decided not to represent will hire attorneys who might 
 lack our Firm's skill and sophistication, and who could take actions that adversely affect your case, 
 the law, and future prospects for recovery. 
 OUR REASONS AGAINST REPRESENTING MULTIPLE CLIENTS 
 Our greatest concern in representing multiple clients is that a conflict of interest could develop 
 between or among our clients. It is impossible to anticipate every potential conflict. The biggest risk 
 in multiple client cases is that the defendant might lack the assets or insurance coverage to pay all 
 claims in full. If we collect all of that money for one client, then we may have deprived our other 
 clients of any chance of being fairly compensated by that defendant. 
 It is also possible that a defendant will insist on a common settlement fund which means that it will 
 pay a fixed amount to settle all cases. The challenge in that situation is dividing the settlement fund 
 among multiple clients. We could not represent any one client against the interests of any other 
 client. It would be necessary, therefore, to refer all of our clients to separate attorneys to resolve the 
 issue concerning the distribution of the common fund. 
 On the other hand, defendants and their insurance companies often insist on a common settlement 
 fund because they want to resolve all of their risk at the same time. In turn, they are often willing to 
 pay more to resolve all of their risk than if they are only settling some of the claims. 
 It is also possible that one client will reveal information that is damaging to another client. In this 
 situation, we may no longer be able to represent either client and each client may need to seek 
 separate attorneys. 
 Finally, you lose some measure of confidentiality when you join forces with another party. Thus, if 
 there is a meeting of several clients to discuss joint strategy, no one can prevent one client from 
 revealing what was said at the meeting. Even an agreement to keep the content of the meeting 
 confidential is difficult to enforce. (Individual attorney-client communications, however, always 
 remain strictly confidential.)

 Castellani, Adam 
 Sex Case Victims Lining Up. 
 The New York Post -- Page Six 
 15 October 2007 
 g, Mon, 15 Oct 2007 at 15:27 * 
 October 15, 2007 -- LAWYERS for Manhattan billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein - who's agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage hookers -
 are bracing for a slew of lawsuits from as many as 40 young women who came to his Palm Beach mansion for massage sessions, Page Six has 
 learned. 
 During the probe that led to Epstein's plea deal, which will put him behind bars for 18 months, underage girls told cops they claimed to be 18 or 
 over and gave the financier massages for hundreds of dollars per session. One g 
 "purple vibrator" on her while she partially stripped. Cops say Epstein's assistant, 
 court documents as just 14, said Epstein used a 
 helped arrange the massages. 
 "The lawyers have identified up to 40 women who could come forward, even though some of them didn't even see Epstein - they just 
 accompanied their friends and stayed in the kitchen and had lunch," the source said. 
 Epstein's legal team is also fighting to get some portions of the police report chronicling the sleazy activities changed. "For example, the state 
 police reported finding in Mr. Epstein's garbage a 'sex toy.' 
 Meanwhile, the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach last night confirmed a Web site report that Epstein has been banned there. "He would use the 
 spa to try to procure girls. But one of them, a masseuse about 18 years old, he tried to get her to do things," a source told us. "Her father found 
 out about it and went absolutely ape-[bleep]. Epstein's not allowed back." Epstein denies he is banned from Mar-a-Lago and says, in fact, he was 
 recently invited to an event there.

 The other female therapists are booked this week. I am away quite a bit 
 over the summer, but if it helps I can see her 2pm Wednesday 2nd July or 
 12pm Sat 5th July at Portman Square. I might be able to fit in some 
 other sessions with her over the summer before I return fully from

 Oh, I understand! I thought you were looking to be seen together. 
 The other female therapists are booked this week. I am away quite a bit 
 over the summer, but if it helps I can see her 2pm Wednesday 2nd July or 
 12pm Sat 5th July at Portman Square. I might be able to fit in some 
 other sessions with her over the summer before I return fully from 
 Summer break in September. 
 Let me know if that would be ok f

 Sorry, I forgot to mention my attorneys are having difficulty booking my interview with the administrator. I have repeatedly asked my attorneys to book me the next available interview slot, and they 
 keep on wanting to book the 30th of October or after or just before the deadline on the 19th of October. 
 Please can you help me book an interview, as I need plenty of time to make my Objection before the 19th October deadline?

 Dear Linda, 
 I hope you are well. I am sending you an email before our scheduled conversation later as there are some things I want to say.

 How you can be discriminated against 
 Discrimination can come in one of the following forms: 
 • direct discrimination - treating someone with a protected characteristic 
 less favourably than others 
 • indirect discrimination - putting rules or arrangements in place that apply 
 to everyone, but that put someone with a protected characteristic at an 
 unfair disadvantage 
 • harassment - unwanted behaviour linked to a protected characteristic that 
 violates someone's dignity or creates an offensive environment for them 
 • victimisation - treating someone unfairly because they've complained 
 about discrimination or harassment 
 It can be lawful to have specific rules or arrangements in place, as long as 
 they can be justified.

 Overview 
 The Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination in the 
 workplace and in wider society. 
 It replaced previous anti-discrimination laws with a single Act, making the law 
 easier to understand and strengthening protection in some situations. It sets 
 out the different ways in which it's unlawful to treat someone. 
 Find out more about who is  protected from discrimination, the types of 
 discrimination under the law and what action  you can take if you feel you've 
 been unfairly discriminated against. 
 Discrimination: making a complaint 
 Before the Act came into force there were several pieces of legislation to 
 cover discrimination, including: 
 • Sex Discrimination Act 1975 
 • Race Relations Act 1976 
 • Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
 If you wish to complain about possible unlawful treatment there are 2 
 separate processes, depending on when it happened. 
 Complaints: before October 2010 
 If you were subjected to unlawful treatment (eg discrimination, harassment 
 or victimisation) before 1 October 2010, the Equality Act won't apply. Instead, 
 you'll be covered by the legislation that was in force at the time. 
 For example, if you experienced race discrimination on 30 September 2010 
 and want to make a complaint or bring legal proceedings, the Race Relations

 RELENTLESS PURSUIT: MY FIGHT FOR THE VICTIMS OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN ® 
 try to kill him. While I had never heard anyone say that Epstein had this fear, I had 
 often wondered how it never happened. He continued to talk in a low voice, primarily 
 on the subject of the young females in Epstein's life. He confirmed what many others 
 by this point had said—that Epstein's entire life, from the time he woke up to the time 
 he went to sleep, revolved around young women. 
 As soon as Jeffrey got out of jail in 2008, there were girls at his house all the time 
 —the only thing that changed was the target age of his victims. They were all prom-
 ised something that Jeffrey would do for them, and at some point, this bodyguard 
 expressed his concern to Jeffrey about his misleading them. He said, "You just got out 
 of jail, you can't keep doing this with these girls." He made it clear that Epstein was 
 engaging in the same conduct that landed him in trouble in the first place but with a 
 slightly older age group, focusing his attention not on rounding up high school kids, 
 but on the modeling industry as his recruiting playground. 
 These were girls who believed they were there—wherever "there" was at any given 
 moment —for a legitimate reason, not illicit sex. But Jeffrey's purpose with them was 
 sex and only sex. His bodyguard watched as dozens of young aspiring models were 
 lured into Epstein's world before being discarded, more broken than before. When 
 this bodyguard told Epstein that he shouldn't keep doing this with girls, he said Ep-
 stein responded, "Don't act like my grandma or you will be fired." 
 Yes, he confirmed that tried to swim off the island, but her attempt showed 
 no greater level of distress than he'd seen in other girls throughout the years. The rest 
 of our meeting had little to do with girls, and much to do with the danger he saw me 
 putting myself in with Epstein. He was himself a real-life tough guy, yet I could tell he 
 was frightened by Epstein. And he stressed that I should also be frightened. He had 
 no precise information; it wasn't as if Epstein had told him I was a target. He simply 
 made it clear that I was somebody Epstein had talked about, and not in a friendly way. 
 But of course, I already knew that. 
 As we got to know each other, he increased the seriousness in his voice. "You don't 
 know who you're dealing with. I worked for him for years and I still don't know who 
 you're dealing with. He knows everybody who's powerful in this world." He went on 
 to explain that Jeff's connections were not just to the local police, who were "definitely 
 in his pocket," and from whom "when he was in jail and on house arrest, he got so 
 many favors." He elaborated that Epstein "made very clear that the federal govern-
 ment would never prosecute him." 
 He also snuck stories in to give me examples of how scary Epstein was. On one 
 occasion, a lawyer was found at the bottom of a swimming pool. Epstein asked him if 
 he thought people would believe it was a suicide, as if it wasn't, and suggested that he,

 I will be flying from Cape Town International to New York hopefully on the 27th of Feb. As I do not have a visa yet I will need a return ticket but a 
 return to the UK (London). As I am on the visa waver I am only allowd to spend a maximum of 90 days in the US, so with the return ticket if you 
 could possibly book the return for +\-87 days after my arrival into the US.Sorry for being so complicated and I really do appreciate your help. 
 Thanks

 Importance: Normal 
 FYI, we engaged Morris yesterday, and he retained counsel. We will likely be conducting a proffer of him in the near 
 future. You folks are welcome to toss any questions you would like us to pose to him. 
 His attorney is already attempting to devalue his roll, indicating he was just a low level relationship manager, amongst 
 many. (Note, he appears to have done very well for himself as a low level relationship manager). 
 Secondly, after out attorney's jump through some hoops, we will likely be seeking to interview Epstein's attorney, who was 
 responsible for a lot of the transactions, and appears to have made efforts to structure transactions, so as to avoid SAR's 
 etc.. As that time come closer, I will reach out to you. 
 Finally, as mentioned, to the extent Maxwell changes her tune, and seek to be more cooperative, we would love to have 
 you ask some questions for us, regarding her understanding of JE's relationship with Deutsche Bank. 
 Many thanks,

Many thanks 
 Hope you guys are well. Mr. Epstein is the gift that keeps giving. As noted, we are looking at Deutsche Bank, 
 for a number of reasons, with one being that they should not have let Epstein bank with them, in that it was clear 
 he was .moving money for the payment of women. They as much admit that, but seem to justify it, in that they 
 did not believe the women to be under age (i.e., complete disregard for the trafficking aspect, or witness 
 tampering). 
 In short, we were wondering who you may have engaged at the bank, and are particularly interested in knowing 
 if you spoke with the relationship manager, Paul Morris. 
 Many thanks!

 Hey M, 
 First and foremost I hope you are well. I am reaching out to figure out if the Epstein case was on your squad. 
 Jammy and I have an investigation into Deutsche Bank, and one of the aspects of the investigation is transaction 
 monitoring, or the lack thereof, and that includes banking Epstein. 
 If the case was on your squad, we were wondering who the case agent was, and further if they spoke with 
 Epsteins relationship manager at the bank, Paul Morris. 
 Thanks!

 Both. But it has checked out so it's off the list. 
 Sorry for any false alarm. 
 If you do recall anything that you think might be of use, however small, 
 please stay in touch. Again, a focus is PRC China involvement.

 Mark, 
 Thank you for your prompt reply my apologies on my slowness. 
 Jumas I met once, in Lord Ahmed's chambers at Israel Shamir's book launch. 
 If I recall, he was distressed with the Turkish ambassador's remark that Palestine 
 was a swamp. 
 Having lived in Turkey, I predicted then that Turkey would not long be an ally of Israel. 
 But that was my only contact with Jumas, if you are talking about the MK who 
 is in a small party that I think has not presence in the Knesset. Haim Oron. 
 The only MK I have been close to lately is Sharon Haskell, the Likud member 
 who convinced the Likud to make pot legal. I gave her a copy of one of my books, 
 the one that was published in English. Pretty and single and hard to forget. 
 One would expect Hank to know him? 
 The names I mentioned, Bull and Erben, are relics. I am sure that they played a part 
 here, but I was clutching at straws, almost certain you would not have heard of them, but I had to 
 try. Bull died in 1990, Erben in 1985. 
 You may be correct that I am barking up the wrong tree, to some degree. Any insight you 
 might have would be appreciated greatly. 
 EFTA00037219
One small suggestion, if you want to limit pesky journalists from your door - go to 
 and look at the tenants roster. 8CD has Anderson with Epstein next to it. It would be simple 
 to remove your surname and limit the curiosity of the press. 
 A green van with NY plates, possibly a Ford, seems to be in your area a lot, I cannot presume it 
 is up to anything bad, but what little info I have you are welcome to. 
 The person I mentioned on the phone is not the nice person you may think they are, neither is 
 their spouse. They are keen on being secure in every way and have no limits to what they would do. 
 I do not like either of them. I may be barking up the wrong tree in some ways, and as I said, I welcome and 
 corrections,but I do have a good idea of what is going on especially with that couple.

I am at a loss to compose this well. But I think you will understand it, and if not please don't hesitate to ask any questions. My eyes 
 are shot and I have a strong headache looking at the screen. In other circumstances I would work this out and send you a better 
 missive, but I feel you want this sooner rather than later. With that preface, have a read: 
 I feel bad about not being able to show you my full hand at the moment. Not to be taken personally, but we were talking on a 
 listening device, and listening devices, like walls, have ears. What I am considering to give you some sense of ease is showing up at 
 the door of a notary who is also an officer of the court, and who has known me for decades, along with my passport to make a 
 sworn statement as to my identity. In our last talk I think you asked for Kevin and/or Calvin. If you know people with these names, 
 I do not want to be the cause of any uneasiness between you, so I will, for their sake, tell you that I am neither a Kevin or a Calvin. 
 Do not rule out that MK is my real name. A sworn statement from an officer of the court, who happens to be a Orthodox Jew, will 
 shine some light upon who I am. 
 Without narrowing down my identity too much, I can tel you that I was in US military intel and had a clearance issued to me young, 
 when my uncle was in fact head of int'l relations at the Pentagon and answered directly to the president. Other family members 
 hold TS + and I might ask one to be a liaison. 
 But the point is not who I am. It is your security. Please do not be lulled into a false sense of such because you were left alone to 
 parade your car etc in full view. I would ask Ramon to keep the metal gates down at all times in the future. 
 When the #1 target was a risk factor to a certain already mentioned person and their allies, you were safe. Until he was out of the 
 equation. Now they can work down the list. 
 I am not sure if GM is on it or their ally, she thinks she is but allies have ways of falling out. Or falling down dark stairs, despite her 
 power. 
 I gave you a warning; you might cynically think what I might want in return. It might cross your mind that I work for a security 
 firm and want you as a client. I do not, I make no referral that way. There are many which employ the kind of people I did mention. 
 Nor do I want $ or access to any assets. 
 But I am ready at this time to tell you what I do want, and I would think that there is much symbiosis. Let me back up just a bit and 
 say that while Jeffrey would never do anything that he knew would hurt other Jews, he has left lots for anti Jewish conspiracy 
 theorists to use. No surprise to you I am sure that many are rushing to say that he, and you and sometimes even all of us are 
 Mossad. And I take into account that many of the accusations against him are false, some conflated. His friend Mr Dershowitz has 
 already 100% proven them wrong and one accuser a liar. Not to paint Jeffrey as a saint, he ought to have spent more time studying 
 Torah than partying in the company of ungodly people. 
 His poor choice of companions, and his poor choice of activities, has done harm not only to him, but to all Jews. This is in fact part 
 of what some foreign intel agencies want to happen, masking their own presence and making Israel weaker. I complicate this, my 
 apologies, but it is a complex equation of using cutouts to do intel work and then 
 letting others take the blame. In this case, non Jews used Jeffrey. 
 EFTA00037221
My concern is for the Jewish people. 
 You are a Jew, I am a Jew. What is to be done to rectify this? 
 You have some things here. You have information, which you may not know the value of, 
 as far as it shows that neither you nor he are Mossad, or even working knowingly for any 
 foreign intel agency. 
 But there is the presence of certain parties in this mix who are, including on the Humpty Dumpty charity, which you and he were 
 part of, along with 29 Congressmen. On that bipartisan list we find Hank Johnson, who calls Jews termites; already there is 
 comment not on anti Jewish conspiracy sites, but among members of the tribe. 
 I will not press you for an explanation there. But it is not making the rest of us happy. 
 What is your duty to the Jewish community and to your country, America, in light of this? 
 Clearly it is to aid in identifying those parties that had access to Jeffrey at certain times. 
 Years ago Jeffrey had some exposure to North Korean/Chinese agents, and was in the proximity of arms dealers who sold to these 
 nations and on behalf of them. 
 Gerald Bull may have been involved, after being stripped of his US citizenship. And possibly Dr Herman Erben. That would have 
 bee in Europe, 70s/80s. 
 Up to the present, what needs to be known is more about the PRC Chinese execs at Humpty. And anything else you might see or 
 recall. 
 I appreciate your help, which might be of great use and I would expect that you would not at all go unappreciated for that. 
 You can see why I have an interest in your longevity. 120? 
 But at least not 65.

 FACILITIES MANAGER 
 CAMERA PROJECT / RECORDERING 
 On Saturday August 10, 2019 I was informed that there was no recording of the closed circuit 
 cameras (CCTV) from recorder 2 (Nice). I had Electronic Technician see 
 about getting the recorder operational again by replacing the two (2) hard drivers and start the 
 rebuilding process. Mr. called Signet Technologies to make sure what he was doing was 
 correct and not going to make the problem worse. As the process of the rebuilding of the records 
 the FBI came to the institution to retrieve all video needed. They took all eighteen (18) hard 
 drives, two bad ones that were being replaced and the sixteen (16) that were in the RAID. While 
 this was happening I made phone calls to Steve Smith from Signet Technologies to see about 
 getting a technician from Signet to come to the institution to get the new CCTV equipment up 
 and recording. On Sunday August 11, 2019 Steve Smith called me back and informed me that a 
 technician will be on site Monday afternoon, Mr. Smith informed me to get Mr. to get all 
 the new equipment on the racks and ready for when Jeff McKenzie arrives. On Monday August 
 12, 2019 Jeff McKenzie from Signet arrived and started to look at the existing and new 
 equipment with Mr. . While they were looking the FBI came back and had question on 
 how the system worked and information about the old equipment. Mr. McKenzie assisted with 
 them on how to download what they were asking for. Since it was taking so long to download 
 the Agents left and would return the next day to pick up what was downloaded. 
 On Tuesday August 13, 2019 I had a teleconference with Signet Technli•eve Smith, Jeff 
 McKenzie, Northeast Regional Staff MCC staff and myself to 
 figure the best and fastest way to get the recording of cameras at the institution. During the 
 conversation of what took place we found out that when the FBI took the sixteen (16) hard drives 
 out of the RAID without it finishing the rebuild it might have corrupted any data on the drives. 
 Signet also told us that they would be able to get us recording of the operational cameras by 
 August 14, 2019.

 Subject: Epstein updates 
 All, 
 After much engagement with HQ over the past 48 hours, and our efforts to both consolidate and limit the 
 reporting requirements, HQ is now requesting updates in a conference call to be held daily at 1530. You should 
 all receive the bridge line information tomorrow. Trust me, nothing you're thinking right now hasn't already 
 been communicated to the highest levels. IMO, this is largely driven by DOJ. Is it inconvenient? Yes. 
 Regardless, we'll need to support the calls because those you all deal with in CID are in the exact same position 
 as you. We should support each other and push through. 
 Based on all my calls with HQ, here are some of my thoughts on how we should go forward: 
 Many questions I'm receiving are driven by media reporting (e.g. Maxwell, NM residence search, etc.). If you 
 see sustained reporting on one aspect, get ahead of it. For example...media has been all over the location and 
 role of Maxwell as a co-conspirator. I advised that based on the volume and quality of evidence we have, the 
 team is currently focused on charges for a different co-conspirator. However, we're engaged with Counsel for all 
 co-conspirators. Kill the rumor before it gets legs in the minds of senior leadership. 
 With regard to interviews or other investigative techniques, stay general unless we have significant 
 information. You could say, "we conducted interviews of 14 MCC Corrections Officers and continued with the 
 financial analysis but don't have anything signficant to report." Only give names of an interviewee if there was 
 something significant. 
 If we don't have significant results to report, it's ok to say so. Be mindful that most, if not all, of what you say 
 will be pushed to the seventh floor. 
 - Tuesday is a big day with the hearing so be prepared to talk it on Monday and beyond. You can provide 
 the approximate number of victims expected to attend and any efforts we have in making that happen 
 (coordinating transportation, etc.). On Tuesday you'll give the read out of the hearing. In your reporting over 
 the next few days/weeks, stay focused on the investigation of the co-conspirators and stay tight with SDNY on 
 conversations they're having with Counsel and the direction we're headed towards charges. 
 /
 and on Wednesday - I've continually expressed to HQ how C-19 and C-2 are tight on the 
 drug/sex case. You guys can speak together about that case. Clearly we're focused on analysis of the phones as 
 well as the nature and timing of likely charges. 
 - I talked to and know that you guys have a couple big interviews to do that will determine if the 
 PC case has any legs or if gets shut down. I would focus on advising of the timing of those interviews. 
 - I've included you here FYSA. Let me know if you want the bridge line details as well. 
 Enjoy your Sunday.

 Video Outside Epstein's Cell During First Suicide Attempt "No Longer Exists," Prosecutors Say. USA 
 Today (119, Johnson, 10.31M) reports, "Prosecutors told a federal judge Thursday that prison authorities 
 inadvertently deleted surveillance video of the area outside the Manhattan jail cell of accused child sex trafficker 
 Jeffrey Epstein during his first suicide attempt." Prosecutors told US District Judge Kenneth Karas "authorities 
 had mistakenly preserved video from a different part of the detention facility instead of the area where Epstein 
 and Tartaglione were housed in July." According to the article, "the disclosure is likely to revive conspiracy 
 EFTA00037230
theories suggesting Epstein was murdered to keep him from discussing his activities with a constellation of 
 influential friends." 
 CNN (119, Simko-Bednarski, Levenson, 83.16M) reports, "Prison officers at the Metropolitan 
 Correctional Center (MCC) in New York found Epstein on the floor of his cell in the early-morning hours of July 
 23. He was found with a strip of bedsheet around his neck in what a federal document calls an apparent suicide 
 attempt." On July 25, "an attorney for Epstein's cellmate at the time asked that MCC preserve video from outside 
 the cell, the filing notes. MCC legal counsel looked up the cellmate's cell number in the MCC computer system 
 and requested that the staff preserve video of the cell from that night, the filing says," but "the attorney said in 
 December that security footage from that night was missing. The government responded a day later, saying the 
 video was not missing and that it had been preserved," but "the letter filed Thursday indicated that the video was 
 in fact gone due to a mix-up. The MCC computer system had listed an incorrect cell for Epstein's cellmate, and 
 so MCC staff had preserved unrelated footage, according to the government's letter." 
 The AP (1/9, Mustian, Balsamo) reports from New York, "The FBI also has determined that the footage does not 
 exist on the jail's backup v

 We spoke with Mark Epstein and were able to get the original emails from him. Bill is analyzing the headers and will 
 send an attachment shortly with the analysis results as well as copies of those emails. 
 As for the YouTube video, I am doubtful that we will get a copy of this. As I understand it, Mark received an email 
 from Jeff that had a YouTube link to a "mock interview" between Jeff and Steve Bannon. Apparently there were 
 some comments about Trump and their relationship that Mark thought were of interest. We understand Mark 
 received this email from Jeff sometime this year, 3-4 months ago, and viewed it at that time. When he went back a 
 couple weeks later to view it, it was no longer available. (Sounds like the YouTube video was taken down whether it

 We spoke with Mark Epstein and were able to get the original emails from him. Bill is analyzing the headers and will 
 send an attachment shortly with the analysis results as well as copies of those emails. 
 As for the YouTube video, I am doubtful that we will get a copy of this. As I understand it, Mark received an email from 
 Jeff that had a YouTube link to a "mock interview" between Jeff and Steve Bannon. Apparently there were some 
 comments about Trump and their relationship that Mark thought were of interest. We understand Mark received this 
 email from Jeff sometime this year, 3-4 months ago, and viewed it at that time. When he went back a couple weeks 
 later to view it, it was no longer available. (Sounds like the YouTube video was taken down whether it was a private 
 video or public video.) Mark cannot locate the original email from Jeff or the YouTube link. He is reviewing his YouTube 
 Internet history as well as searching his emails for it.

 Subject: Jumas/name on roster 
 Date: Thu, 15 Aug 2019 20:07:37 +0000 
 Mark, 
 Thank you for your prompt reply my apologies on my slowness. 
 Jumas I met once, in Lord Ahmed's chambers at Israel Shamir's book launch. 
 If I recall, he was distressed with the Turkish ambassadors remark that Palestine 
 was a swamp. 
 Having lived in Turkey, I predicted then that Turkey would not long be an ally of Israel. 
 But that was my only contact with Jumas, if you are talking about the MK who 
 is in a small party that I think has not presence in the Knesset. Haim Oron. 
 The only MK I have been close to lately is Sharon Haskell, the Likud member 
 who convinced the Likud to make pot legal. I gave her a copy of one of my books, 
 the one that was published in English. Pretty and single and hard to forget. 
 One would expect Hank to know him? 
 The names I mentioned, Bull and Erben, are relics. I am sure that they played a part 
 here, but I was clutching at straws, almost certain you would not have heard of them, but I had to 
 try. Bull died in 1990, Erben in 1985. 
 You may be correct that I am barking up the wrong tree, to some degree. Any insight you 
 might have would be appreciated greatly. 
 One small suggestion, if you want to limit pesky journalists from your door - go to 
 and look at the tenants roster. 8CD has Anderson with Epstein next to it. It would be simple 
 to remove your surname and limit the curiosity of the press. 
 A green van with NY plates, possibly a Ford, seems to be in your area a lot, I cannot presume it 
 is up to anything bad, but what little info I have you are welcome to. 
 The person I mentioned on the phone is not the nice person you may think they are, neither is 
 their spouse. They are keen on being secure in every way and have no limits to what they would do. 
 I do not like either of them. I may be barking up the wrong tree in some ways, and as I said, I welcome and 
 corrections,but I do have a good idea of what is going on especially with that couple. 
 Best,

 EFTA00037239
Mark, 
 I am at a loss to compose this well. But I think you will understand it, and if not please don't hesitate to ask any questions. 
 My eyes are shot and I have a strong headache looking at the screen. In other circumstances I would work this out and 
 send you a better missive, but I feel you want this sooner rather than later. With that preface, have a read: 
 I feel bad about not being able to show you my full hand at the moment. Not to be taken personally, but we were talking on 
 a listening device, and listening devices, like walls, have ears. What I am considering to give you some sense of ease is 
 showing up at the door of a notary who is also an officer of the court, and who has known me for decades, along with my 
 passport to make a sworn statement as to my identity. In our last talk I think you asked for Kevin and/or Calvin. If you know 
 people with these names, I do not want to be the cause of any uneasiness between you, so I will, for their sake, tell you 
 that I am neither a Kevin or a Calvin. Do not rule out that MK is my real name. A sworn statement from an officer of the 
 court, who happens to be a Orthodox Jew, will shine some light upon who I am. 
 Without narrowing down my identity too much, I can tel you that I was in US military intel and had a clearance issued to me 
 young, when my uncle was in fact head of int'l relations at the Pentagon and answered directly to the president. Other 
 family members hold TS + and I might ask one to be a liaison. 
 But the point is not who I am. It is your security. Please do not be lulled into a false sense of such because you were left 
 alone to parade your car etc in full view. I would ask Ramon to keep the metal gates down at all times in the future. 
 When the #1 target was a risk factor to a certain already mentioned person and their allies, you were safe. Until he was out 
 of the equation. Now they can work down the list. 
 I am not sure if GM is on it or their ally, she thinks she is but allies have ways of falling out. Or falling down dark stairs, 
 despite her power. 
 I gave you a warning; you might cynically think what I might want in return. It might cross your mind that I work for a 
 security firm and want you as a client. I do not, I make no referral that way. There are many which employ the kind of 
 people I did mention. 
 Nor do I want $ or access to any assets. 
 But I am ready at this time to tell you what I do want, and I would think that there is much symbiosis. Let me back up just a 
 bit and say that while Jeffrey would never do anything that he knew would hurt other Jews, he has left lots for anti Jewish 
 conspiracy theorists to use. No surprise to you I am sure that many are rushing to say that he, and you and sometimes 
 even all of us are Mossad. And I take into account that many of the accusations against him are false, some conflated. His 
 friend Mr Dershowitz has already 100% proven them wrong and one accuser a liar. Not to paint Jeffrey as a saint, he ought 
 to have spent more time studying Torah than partying in the company of ungodly people. 
 His poor choice of companions, and his poor choice of activities, has done harm not only to him, but to all Jews. This is in 
 fact part of what some foreign intel agencies want to happen, masking their own presence and making Israel weaker. I 
 complicate this, my apologies, but it is a complex equation of using cutouts to do intel work and then 
 letting others take the blame. In this case, non Jews used Jeffrey. 
 EFTA00037240
My concern is for the Jewish people. 
 You are a Jew, I am a Jew. What is to be done to rectify this? 
 You have some things here. You have information, which you may not know the value of, 
 as far as it shows that neither you nor he are Mossad, or even working knowingly for any 
 foreign intel agency. 
 But there is the presence of certain parties in this mix who are, including on the Humpty Dumpty charity, which you and he 
 were part of, along with 29 Congressmen. On that bipartisan list we find Hank Johnson, who calls Jews termites; already 
 there is comment not on anti Jewish conspiracy sites, but among members of the tribe. 
 I will not press you for an explanation there. But it is not making the rest of us happy. 
 What is your duty to the Jewish community and to your country, America, in light of this? 
 Clearly it is to aid in identifying those parties that had access to Jeffrey at certain times. 
 Years ago Jeffrey had some exposure to North Korean/Chinese agents, and was in the proximity of arms dealers who sold 
 to these nations and on behalf of them. 
 Gerald Bull may have been involved, after being stripped of his US citizenship. And possibly Dr Herman Erben. That would 
 have bee in Europe, 70s/80s. 
 Up to the present, what needs to be known is more about the PRC Chinese execs at Humpty. And anything else you might 
 see or recall. 
 I appreciate your help, which might be of great use and I would expect that you would not at all go unappreciated for that. 
 You can see why I have an interest in your longevity. 120? 
 But at least not 65.

 Please tell him to let me know where/when to meet. 
 On another note, I will be in Paris from the 25th to 28th. Would it be 
 possible to get into Jeffs place there so I can isolate family items, and

 Subject: EPSTEIN Mark / request / file 7083/2117493/Roa 
 Good morning 
 We received the following request from the cantonal police of Wallis : 
 On 02.06.2020, a person called EPSTEIN Mark from New York City contacted the operations centre of the 
 cantonal police of Wallis in CH-Sion. 
 Later on the same day (at 16:21 hours and 16:24 hours), he sent an email to the said police service. 
 He stated that he was the brother of EPSTEIN Jeffrey, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in 
 custody. 
 When he was investigating his brother's death, he allegedly came by chance across a conversation between a 
 person unknown to him - "Mim Mim" - and a Mister HAUB. 
 EPSTEIN Mark also sent a screenshot of the Linkedin profile of "Mim Mim" and a screenshot of two messages 
 from "Mim Mim" in which the unknown person threatened EPSTEIN Mark with the death of his children. 
 On 04.06.2020, at 13:30 hours, we called EPSTEIN Mark. He told us, that his deceased brother and HAUB Karl 
 Erivan were possibly murdered. 
 He takes this assumption from the statements of the mail contents sent by the unknown person "Mim Mim". 
 HAUB Karl Erivan is missing since 07.04.2018, after a ski tour in the high mountains of CH-Zermatt. 
 Up to now, there are no indications that the disappearance of Mr. HAUB in CH-Zermatt, could be due to a 
 violent crime. 
 The below listed information was taken from the e-mails forwarded to us by EPSTEIN Mark, which were sent 
 between 30.05.2020 and 04.06.2020: 
 - "Mim Mim" and HAUB Christian (brother of the missing person) allegedly had a conversation. 
 - "Mim Mim" claims to have received hush money from BUSS Leander (alleged security officer of Tengelmann). 
 - "Mim Mim" allegedly sold documents 
 - The disappearance of HAU Karl Erivan and the death of EPSTEIN Jeffrey are allegedly connected. 
 Furthermore, EPSTEIN Mark L. stated to have been in contact with the following FBI agent: 
 office: 
 mobiel: 
 EPSTEIN Mark L. is using the following email-accounts and phone number: 
 The unknown person "Mim Mim" should be using the below mentioned email-accounts 
 Request: 
 EFTA00037259
- Are the US authorities aware of any reports from EPSTEIN Mark regarding HAUB Karl Erivan? 
 - Do the US authorities have information concerning a possible link between EPSTEIN and HAUB Karl Erivan 
 that could be relevant for the investigation of the missing person's case in CH-Zermatt? 
 - In regard to the person EPSTEIN Mark, how would you evaluate the information provided by him? 
 - any other relevant information

 I'm a fact check reporter for The Daily Caller investigating a potentially false claim about the island of Little St. 
 James in the U.S. Virgin Islands that has been circulating online. The claim is that the FBI recovered human 
 bones in the water near the island, which was previously owned by Jeffrey Epstein. 
 Has the FBI found or recovered human remains of any kind on or near the island since Epstein was arrested on 
 July 6? 
 If you could respond as soon as possible, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

 This morning's press conference took us by surprise -- our supervisors did not say anything to us about it in advance, and 
 in particular had no idea that there would be comments about the active investigation. Our understanding now is that the 
 event was in connection with Safe Horizon, the victim services organization, and that answered at least one 
 specific question about the investigation, relating to Prince Andrew. We just heard from that he spoke to 
 about it (I think earlier today?) so everybody is playing catch up.

 Subject: Epstein case 
 Due to the high profile nature of Epstein, the fact that EM is engaged at multiple levels, and that we have 
 numerous fronts of this investigation, I'd like you to start a SCN and include an updated SCN with your weekly 
 sit reps to . It should include updates on each of the facets of the investigation: victim interviews, 
 digital analysis, financial analysis, forfeiture, public corruption, and significant events (e.g. the search of his 
 island). These should detail who and what we're finding. For example, the financial analysis section could 
 be..."Financial Analysis: SONY, in collaboration with Squad C-XX (assuming they're working with our FAs) and 
 outside vendor XXXXX, are reviewing XXX investment and money market accounts located at XYZ Bank and 
 ABC Brokerage Firm. Significant findings include $250,000 payment to XXX and $100,000 payment to XXX on 
 XX/XX/XXXX, which coincide with the Miami Herald articles. Additional subpoenas to be served." If we don't 
 have anything on the PC side, then just type "Nothing Significant To Report." The key here is that we want to 
 make sure and are comfortable we're tracking all fronts. 
 We need a conference call tomorrow. If you haven't talked to M, call him today and let's get it set up. 
 Check their availability and socialize CEOS's inclusion. I think their involvement would be good especially 
 considering the fact the victim yesterday said JE asked her opinion about putting heads of adult females on 
 child bodies and masturbating to the image. That's right up the CP alley and is good for an affidavit. 
 You saw my effort on the taint team TDYs. is supportive and is checking on bringing people from CEOU. 
 The A/SC is briefing the DAD this morning on the case. 
 Call me when you get to the office.

 I am sure you are familiar with the Epstein case, we recently received the case file from MM. The USAO SDNY is 
 requesting the case file be sent to a third party vendor so the documents can be scanned. Apparently this has been done 
 numerous times in the past with other FBI files (see below). With a file this size I think their request makes sense as they 
 want to have the file in a digital format for scanning, cataloguing, and indexing purposes. Does Miami have any objection 
 to us releasing the file in its entirety so SDNY can utilized a vetted third party vendor to scan the files? I have cc'd the NY0 
 CDC, so she can weigh in on the discussion. 
 Thanks,

 Sean, 
 Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a 
 number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our 
 paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York field 
 office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned. 
 The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for original 
 and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.): 
 U.S. v. Chambers, 
 U.S. V. Ade!glass,
 U.S. V. Ng Lap Sen 
 U.S. V. Tortora, or 
 U.S. V. Ashrof Has 
 U.S. V. Goldbrene 
 U.S. V. Vargas, he, 
 U.S. V. Krupkin, d 
 U.S. V. Cruz, over
 In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all the 
 information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be able to 
 EFTA00037279
continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem. 
 Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk 
 with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week.

 Hello,

 We've seen reports that a who says she was sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein in 1996, reported her assault to the FBI in 1996. Can you 
 please verify this document's existence? Please find below excerpts from the Miami Herald alleging the existence of this report: 
 • A new victim has gone public in the Jeffrey Epstein case, filing a sworn affidavit in federal court in New York Tuesday, saying that she was sexually 
 assaulted and her then-ls-year-old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996. 
 then 26, claims that she was employed by Epstein, a multimillionaire financier who lived in a vast mansion on New York's Upper East Side, 
 and that she frequently saw "school-age girls" wearing uniforms come into the mansion and go upstairs. She was told that the girls were auditioning for 
 modeling work, according to her affidavit. 
 Then an art student in New York, 
 Thank you and I look forward to hearing back from you.

 I am sure you are familiar with the Epstein case, we recently received the case file from MM. The USAO SDNY is 
 requesting the case file be sent to a third party vendor so the documents can be scanned. Apparently this has been done 
 numerous times in the past with other FBI files (see below). With a file this size I think their request makes sense as they 
 want to have the file in a digital format for scanning, cataloguing, and indexing purposes. Does Miami have any objection 
 to us releasing the file in its entirety so SDNY can utilized a vetted third party vendor to scan the files? I have cc'd the NY0 
 so she can weigh in on the discussion. I would like to have your concurrence before releasing the files 
 since they belong to MM.

 Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a 
 number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our

 office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned.

 We had every intention on getting the materials from the ADELGLASS search scanned but we did not. it was a 
 lot of back and forth with the SDNY. 
 However, we did get the materials from the search of CITY MEDICAL scanned and they were patient medical 
 files. SDNY took care of arranging. We did not have any problems at all. After they were scanned, the 
 documents were loaded into Relativity and we reviewed them in there. 
 Thanks

 SDNY is requesting we turn over to them one of our files in its entirety so it can be scanned by a third 
 party vendor. The AUSA mentioned that he did this for your case, U.S. vs Adeglass (see below). I was wondering how this 
 went, if there were any legal hurdles with the request, any issues I should be aware of before I agree? We've never had a 
 request like this but it makes sense due to the enormity of the file. I have been getting pushback from legal regarding 
 turning a whole file over to the USAO. Just wanted to get your take on this before committing.

Wanted to quickly follow up on this to see if there's any update on status (both in terms of whether the documents 
 are en route, and also the prospects for our office managing the vendor process)? Please let us know when you have 
 a chance? And if anything else from us would be helpful, we're happy to do whatever we can to get the gears 
 turning. 
 thanks again,

 Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a 
 number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our 
 paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York 
 field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned. 
 The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for 
 original and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.): 
 U.S. v. Chambe 
 U.S. v. Adelyrics 
 U.S. v. Ng Lap S 
 U.S. v. Tortora, 
 U.S. v. Ashraf H 
 U.S. v. Goldbren 
 U.S. v. Vargas,
 U.S. v. Krupkin, 
 U.S. v. Cruz, ov
 In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep 
 all the information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to 
 be able to continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem. 
 Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to 
 talk with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week. 
 thanks again

 6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
 In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
 recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
 partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
 hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
 recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
 contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
 On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. The indictment is sealed. An arrest

Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago 
 we understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them available 
 for OPR several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. Our 
 understanding was that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the case 
 team identified when we visited back in January (that were in the possession ofM. So I'm not sure what still 
 needs to be located? 
 And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a 
 resolution for sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will 
 happen when they get here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs to 
 know what the files consist of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to whoever we 
 need to in order to explain why it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us (or even directly 
 to the vendor), or at least to have the vendor plan approved to start immediately when the materials arrive. 
 We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or 
 the criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these docs, but we initially 
 requested them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally 
 resolved it with the Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors to 
 have it resolved. 
 Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they 
 should call)? And thanks again for your help. 
 en t: Friday, May 14, 1019 Ub: 
 ThanksIM we are still trying to locate the files and determine a time frame on the delivery. I'm discussing the 
 situation with my ASAC and FBI legal, i don't think they're opposed to your idea but right now they don't want the 
 files going direct to the USAO. we'll probably need to get the files here, see what we have and hopefully everyone 
 will be amenable to the third party scanning as discussed. We'll touch base after the holiday.

 I was just contacted by Deanna Paul, a reporter for the Washington Post. She is CCd to this email. 
 Deanna: Marty and Adrienne work in our Office of Public Affairs. 
 In her former life, Deanna was an excellent ADA in Brooklyn. We worked a case together-with NYPD 
 SVU- involving the sexual abuse of several minors in the US and overseas. She got him convicted. That 
 is how she had my contact info. 
 Deanna would like to speak with an agent about the challenges of working sex trafficking cases, especially 
 in cases where the line between victim and subject may be blurred. (My interpretation of her request, not

 Deanna is not looking to do a feature on an agent, etc; she is seeking background information. 
 I told Deanna that you two would be the right people to possibly help facilitate a conversation, if anyone 
 there is willing to do so. 
 If you guys need anything else from me, feel free to hit me up.

 On 7/26/2019, Mima Alsharif from CNN contacted NYO regarding reporting from the Miami Herald in which 
 stated "she was sexually assaulted and her then-15-year old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, 
 Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996." Alsharif was asking for confirmation oficlaims that she had rariifted her assault 
 to the FBI in 1996. Alsharif noted recently released documents that reference a FBI interview of n 2006. NYO 
 was aware that 'nd her younger sister were interviewed by the FBI as part of the MM investigation of 
 Epstein. 
 On 7/29/2019, NYO OPA informed Alsharif that we couldn't comment due to the ongoing investigation and we have not 
 seen any media reporting related to this RFI. 
 On 8/16/2019, NYO OPA received a call from a reporter at the NY Times who stated he had been in contact with 
 and her attorney, Ingrid McColley (ph) . He asked for verification of the alleged notification to 
 the FBI in 1996 and stated McColley/ claimed to have called the FBI after Epstein's arrest but hadn't received a 
 return call. OPA stated we had a proactive effort to make contact with victims via the FBI hotline and that we've 
 contacted everyone who called the FBI hotline. [Note: we have no record of or McColley contacting the 
 FBI after Epstein's arrest.] 
 On 8/16/2019, McColley contacted NYO OPA who then passed the message to me. 
 On 8/16/2019, C-20 contacted McColley who stated was an em lo ee of Epstein's in the 1990s when she was in 
 her 20s. McColley requested any and all documentation regarding alleged contact with the FBI in 1996 
 as well as her 2006 interview. McColley was informed that any requests for information must be made through a formal 
 FOIA request. 
 A search of Sentinel met with negative results for any contact with -in 1996. We do have documentation of 
 an interview with in November, 2006 as part of the MM Epstein investigation. advised that 
 in the 1990s, she went to Epstein's ranch in New Mexico where she "cuddled" with Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell 
 allegedly rubbed her breasts during a massage. 
 On 8/16/2019, the NY Times reported advised that they would be publishing their story next week. 
 I'm unsure what the NY Times intends to say, but wanted to ensure everyone was aware in case they suggest the FBI 
 knew of Epstein's criminal activity as early as 1996.

 FYI, I'm waiting to hear back from—regarding the status of the file.

 Subject: RE: records management (Epstein investigation) 
 Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago we 
 understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them available for OPR 
 several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. Our understanding was 
 that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the case team identified when we 
 visited back in January (that were in the possession oM So I'm not sure what still needs to be located? 
 And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a resolution for 
 sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will happen when they get 
 here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs to know what the files consist 
 of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to whoever we need to in order to explain why 
 it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us (or even directly to the vendor), or at least to have the 
 vendor plan approved to start immediately when the materials arrive. 
 We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or the 
 criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these dots, but we initially requested 
 them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally resolved it with the 
 Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors to have it resolved. 
 Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they should 
 call)? And thanks again for your help.

 Thanks —.ye are still trying to locate the files and determine a time frame on the delivery. I'm discussing the situation 
 with my ASAC and FBI legal, i don't think they're opposed to your idea but right now they don't want the files going direct

to the USAO. we'll probably need to get the files here, see what we have and hopefully everyone will be amenable to the 
 third party scanning as discussed. We'll touch base after the holiday.

 Wanted to quickly follow up on this to see if there's any update on status (both in terms of whether the documents are 
 en route, and also the prospects for our office managing the vendor process)? Please let us know when you have a 
 chance? And if anything else from us would be helpful, we're happy to do whatever we can to get the gears turning.

 Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a 
 number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our 
 paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York 
 field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned. 
 The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for original 
 and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.): 
 U.S. v. Chambers, 
 U.S. V. Ade!glass, 
 U.S. V. Ng Lap Sec 
 U.S. V. Tortoro, or 
 U.S. V. Ashrof Has 
 U.S. v. Goldbrene 
 U.S. v. Vargas, he 
 U.S. V. Krupkin, d 
 U.S. V. Cruz, over 
 In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all 
 the information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be 
 able to continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem. 
 Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk 
 with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week. 
 thanks again,

 ere are the documents now? I don't think we're adamantly opposed to use of the outside vendor, but I don't 
 think it's smart for the documents to go directly to them. We should get them, assess the inventory of records and 
 then talk about getting the appropriate records to SDNY.

 Just an FYI, as a result of the Epstein arrest and indictment, we will be traveling to Florida to interview 
 approximately 25 victims. Most of the victims are in the Miami/West Palm Beach area, however, two victims are 
 believed to be in Winter Gardens and Palm Harbor. Just wanted to let you know we will be in your AOR, flying 
 down tonight and starting interviews tomorrow. Let me know if you need more information.

 6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
 In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
 recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
 partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
 hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
 recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
 contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
 On August 10, 2019, a search warrant for Epstein's private island, Little Saint James located off the coast of St Thomas, U.S. 
 Virgin Islands is expected to be sworn out. The warrant will be executed on August 12, 2019.

 A team of FBI/NYPD will travel from New York, NY to St Thomas U.S. Virgin Island on Sunday August 11th, 2019. 
 On Monday August 12th, FBI/NYPD team will reach Little St James (LSJ) and execute the search warrant. The group will divide 
 into four teams and conduct a security sweep of the entire island, making entry into any and all structures. Team 1 will sweep 
 ALPHA - Zone 1, Team 2 will sweep BRAVO - Zone 2, Team 3 will sweep CHARLIE- Zone 3, and Team 4 will sweep DELTA - Zone 
 4 (see attached zone descriptions). All individuals encountered on the island will be searched for weapons and once cleared, will 
 be brought to a central location (TBD) for interviews. Agents/TFOs will attempt to identify employees on the island to provide 
 access to locked structures and containers. In the event a structure or container needs to be accessed the Breech Team will be 
 contacted. 
 Once all zones are secured search teams lead by FBI ERT will search any and all structures on L.S.I. Teams will then break off to 
 conduct any interviews of all persons found on LSJ.

 EFTA00037377
Jeffrey Epstein's conduct became the subject of an investigation by the West Palm Beach Police 
 Department, and then the FBI, after the parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein had 
 abused their daughter in 2005. Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among 
 other things, interviews with approximately 35 victims; a search warrant executed on Epstein's Florida 
 residence; and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. Epstein was offered a non-prosecution 
 agreement by the Southern District of Florida. The terms of the 2007 non-prosecution agreement required 
 Epstein to plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution, which he did in 2008. He was sentenced to 
 18 months in jail, was permitted to serve his sentence in a facility where he was released during the day to work, 
 and was released from his sentence after serving approximately 13 months. In December 2018, SDNY 
 approached the FBI NY to open an investigation into Epstein regarding his conduct in New York. 
 Epstein has had significant connections to New York City for many years. He owns what is 
 reportedly the largest private residence in Manhattan, spanning an entire city block, and his professional career 
 has been centered in part in New York. He was an investor in a modeling agency based in New York City, and 
 during the relevant period spent significant time at his Manhattan mansion. As described by at least one 
 individual ("Victim-1") who was victimized and recruited dozens of other minor victims in New York City, Epstein 
 victimized approximately dozens of girls in New York, in addition to the dozens of girls he victimized in Florida. 
 Epstein knew that Victim-1 was under the age of 18, and he knew the other girls she was bringing were under 
 18. In particular, Victim-1 recalls having truthfully told Epstein that she was 14 years old, and recalls Epstein 
 being upset if she brought him girls who looked like they were 18 or older. 
 Agents and SDNY AUSAs have traveled to Florida on multiple occasions to interview victims. The 
 identified victims' ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been approximately 15 or 
 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. Epstein's conduct included masturbating 
 in front of victims; fondling the breasts of victims; placing a vibrator on the genitals of victims; and directly 
 touching the genitals of victims. Victims would have to perform these massages nude or partially nude. Victims 
 were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they went to Epstein's residence. Two of the victims ("Victim-
 2 and Victim-3") were interviewed in Florida and both have reported the above listed conduct. Like Victim-1, 
 Victim -2 estimated bringing dozens of girls to Epstein. Epstein's conduct reportedly occurred in locations 
 including, but not limited to, New York City, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. 
 Victims in New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for 
 Epstein to arrange his "massages." In New York, one of those individuals was in Florida, the primary 
 contact for the girls was . Additionally, and in order to maintain a steady stream of underage girls to 
 perform sexual acts, Epstein and his co-conspirators also coerced others, including some of his victims, to recruit 
 other minor girls to engage in "massages" and sexual conduct with Epstein. The recruiters were paid by Epstein 
 and co-conspirators for bringing additional minor girls to Epstein's properties for those purposes. 
 Following the filing of the initial indictment charging Epstein, we hope to approach other suspected 
 and alleged co-conspirators, and to further develop evidence against such individuals through the overt 
 investigation, with the possibility of utilizing certain such individuals as cooperating defendants.

 In connection with the Epstein victim services meetings, could you also let us know the date of the New York meeting, 
 assuming it's still the plan to do a meeting in both locations? 
 And on the same subject, do you know when notifications are going out about those meetings, and who's coordinating 
 that? We'd like to talk to whoever is doing the notices so we can make sure it's clear that there won't be any 
 substantive update about the investigation or the status of the case. We won't be attending for that reason, and we 
 don't want any victims or their counsel to have the misimpression that this is anything but purely services-related info. 
 We'll also circle up internally about whether we could come down that week for interviews, separately—I'll be in 
 Nashville from the 15th through the lath for a separate work trip, but will check wit i their 
 schedules.

 Let's discuss this when you are all available, we will need to start doing some type of weekly report on the Epstein case.

 Subject: Epstein case 
 Due to the high profile nature of Epstein, the fact that EM is engaged at multiple levels, and that we have 
 numerous fronts of this investigation, I'd like you to start a SCN and include an updated SCN with your weekly 
 sit reps to . It should include updates on each of the facets of the investigation: victim interviews, 
 digital analysis, financial analysis, forfeiture, public corruption, and significant events (e.g. the search of his 
 island). These should detail who and what we're finding. For example, the financial analysis section could 
 be..."Financial Analysis: SDNY, in collaboration with Squad C-XX (assuming they're working with our FAs) and 
 outside vendor XXXXX, are reviewing XXX investment and money market accounts located at XYZ Bank and ABC 
 Brokerage Firm. Significant findings include $250,000 payment to XXX and $100,000 payment to XXX on 
 XX/XX/XXXX, which coincide with the Miami Herald articles. Additional subpoenas to be served." If we don't 
 have anything on the PC side, then just type "Nothing Significant To Report." The key here is that we want to 
 make sure and Mare comfortable we're tracking all fronts. 
 We need a conference call tomorrow. If you haven't talked to M, call him today and let's get it set up. Check 
 their availability and socialize CEOS's inclusion. I think their involvement would be good especially considering 
 the fact the victim yesterday said JE asked her opinion about putting heads of adult females on child bodies and 
 masturbating to the image. That's right up the CP alley and is good for an affidavit. 
 You saw my effort on the taint team TDYs. is supportive and is checking on bringing people from CEOU. 
 The A/SC is briefing the DAD this morning on the case. 
 Call me when you get to the office.

 All but one of the co-conspirators has been served. The one is a British citizen and is currently out of pocket. There are 
 no significant developments in the case to report other than the planned search warrant in the Virgin Islands. Victim 
 and witness interviews are ongoing, CART is processing the digital media seized from his residence which is close to 
 being ready for review, and SDNY is working with lawyers on co-conspirator cooperation. 
 As for the search operation in the Virgin Islands, see attached tentative travel plans with personnel lists. We are 
 sending RDT down tomorrow to begin working on logistics like securing lodging for the entire team, working on 
 transportation to and from the airport, coordinating with CBP and the Coast Guard regarding transportation from St. 
 Thomas to Epstein's island (Little St. James), etc. Also, securing transportation of vehicles that will be needed to 
 conduct the search on the island, as well as food, water, supplies, etc. We are coordinating with SSRAa, St. 
 Thomas RA (San Juan Division) regarding coordination with those entities above as well as the local authorities. 
 We are sending the case agents down to St. Thomas tomorrow to swear out the warrant on Friday, and to have them 
 conduct a few key interviews of employees we want with us on the island during the search. If the warrant is signed, 
 we plan on having the rest of the team fly down on Sunday 8/11 on the FBI 01400 plane, arriving around 7pm Sunday 
 night. We will then execute the warrant at 6am Monday morning. The island is a 70+ acre property with several small 
 structures and one large house, we anticipate being able to knock the search out in 1— 3 days, depending on what we 
 find. Please let me know if you have any questions.

 I saw the ERT email that went out the other day. Unfortunately next week is pretty busy for me with proffers 
 Mon-Tues and a trip to DC on Wed-Thurs for an HSI coordination meeting. But I can see if I can re-schedule 
 any of those if you're desperate for additional bodies. I may be able to get someone to cover the DC trip for me.

 hi, adrienne said she passed on my email to you. 
 we've been trying to track the financial side of Epstein's world for a while. 
 while we know your agents search his island home (little st james) on aug. 12, it's never been reported 
 whether his business office in St Thomas, in the American Yacht Club was searched 
 We have talked to a merchant in the marina/office complex who said he saw federal agents enter and 
 search the offices of Southern Trust (Epstein's business) on Aug. 12 as well. 
 we are trying to confirm this as it would appear to be a place the FBI would want to search for records, 
 especially after we had a chance to review the financials for Southern Trust and Financial Trust this 
 earlier company) 
 we were also told by another merchant that two weeks before Epstein's arrest, large garbage bags of 
 shredded papers were outside the offices of Southern Trust to be thrown out

 Subject: RE: Press Conference 
 Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2020 19:48:09 +0000 
 Importance: Normal 
 The press conference with SDNY on Monday was hosted by Safe Horizons for the purpose of raising awareness for New 
 York State's Child Victims Act. Safe Horizons is a victim services non-profit organization. The press conference had 
 nothing to do with the Epstein investigation, and while I have not seen the press conference nor have I read a transcript of 
 what was said, I do not believe the case was discussed in any detail with the exception of one remark about Prince 
 Andrew. The FBI was not involved in the decision to hold the press conference in front of Epstein's residence and I could 
 not comment on why that decision was made. If any of the victims have a concern over things said during the press 
 conference

 Thanks, I understand and have reiterated what said to the VS. The victim she is working with stays in contact 
 with the victim in Australia. The victim in her AOR wanted to know why the victims weren't notified. Can she reiterate 
 response or do you prefer to have something written down that she can read off to the victim. I want to make sure 
 this is messaged properly.

 Thank you for the update. As I'm sure has told you, this was not an Epstein related press conference, nor any type 
 of update for the ongoing case. It was exactly what I= had said; a question was asked about Prince Andrew and the US 
 Attorney responded. 
 FYSA, I have not received any calls/contact from victims or attorneys that have kept in steady contact with us on the New 
 York end of things. I'll keep in touch with to handle anything that may come this way. 
 Thanks again,

I wanted you to be aware of an email that was inadvertently sent to me; however, I instructed the VS that if she has 
 questions/concerns about this IF the victims are still inquiring, it needs to be routed through since she is the lead 
 VS on this case and can discuss it with you two. You need to take no action with this VS at this time, but wanted 
 you to be aware.

 I think you sent this to me by mistake as you were directing it to the case agent, NM, however, in my previous response 
 to you, I directed that you do the following: 
 Please see below from the SSA who is responsible for this case: 
 I have not seen or heard the contents of the press conference but it is my understanding that it had nothing to do with the 
 Epstein case. It was simply a press conference to raise awareness for human trafficking. I can't imagine who thought it 
 was a good idea to do it in front of Epsteins house and I think that showed extremely poor judgment. However, I do not 
 believe the case was discussed in any detail with the exception of one remark about Prince Andrew I am confident that 
 the prosecution team was not aware of this press conference, and was equally as upset as we were. I mentioned the press 
 conference to the SAC and the ADIC today and they were not pleased. 
 Please let me know if the victims express concerns about not being notified, but don't go seeking their input on this press 
 conference. 
 I don't want you to add fuel to the fire. If the victims still are inquiring about it, that is a conversation that needs to be had 
 with the case agent, but the questions should be coming from VS as this is her case. 
 Thank you,

 Wanted to let you know that my victim, reached out to me to let me know that she and some 
 of the other Epstein victims (who were unspecifed) were extremely upset that they were not notified of the press 
 conference. 
 She and I communicated a fair bit about it that day and she is fine now, in part, because I told her that I would 
 find out what happened and try to remediate the situation so that it didn't happen again. 
 I am well aware that the situation was the result of poor judgment and lack of communication on the part of the 
 USAO. As such, how would you like me to frame this for the victim(s) that I am getting back to? While 
 EFTA00037416
unfortunately we cannot control others' actions (and thus cannot reassure them that this won't happen again) is 
 this being addressed by the higher ups??? Like, ffs people 
 Frankly, I don't think it inappropriate to let them know where the breakdown occurred and let them know that 
 they (or their attorneys) can provide feedback to, and take it up with, and his office. 
 As the case agent, how would you like me to proceed? 
 Many thanks.

 Hey_, 
 Attached is the drafted sw. You will see highlighted info. I spoke with an agent in st Thomas last night. Fish and Wildlife 
 only sent photos of Great St James so the agent is working on getting the other set. Otherwise we may have to use open 
 source to describe the additional structures/assess the number of additional ones. 
 EFTA00037419
Also, if you can have someone run his e justice to see when the last time he registered the island as his main address that 
 would be helpful to answer one of the missing questions on the sw. I can get her the rest when I get down to st Thomas-
 we are about to take off shortly.

 Myself and are requesting travel to London, accompanied by SDNY AUSA's for the week of March 
 16th. We expect to leave on the 17th and return on the 20th. The purpose of this trip is for the 
 interview/proffer of a witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's. The time and location for this interview has 
 been arranged by the witnesses attorney who has been historically been difficult about changes. Both the 
 witness and her attorney reside in London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview 
 could prove to be vital to the indictment of another co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein which is expected to go 
 to grand jury within a few weeks. This person was witness to and potentially participated in the sexual abuse 
 of minor victims by Jeffery Epstein and his co-conspirators. For these reasons we request to travel while 
 there is a temporary travel restrictions due to the corona virus. Below are the following expected expenses: 
 Airfare: $696 x 2 ($1392) 
 Hotel: $304 x 2 ($608) 
 Parking: $70 x 2 ($140) 
 Taxi: $100 x 2 ($200)

 Hello there, 
 The Marriott and most other hotels are still closed from the storms. The one Marriott on the island is a time share 
 and fully booked next week. Sugar Bay has space for all. 
 The hotel is open for gov and recovery, etc. The gym, pool, and beach are all open. The restaurant is open for 
 supper. We can re-evaluate when we get there. But right now, it's the only thing with gov rate. 
 We will re-evaluate our options Friday.

 This isn't a call that needs to happen anytime soon, but to have prior to the indictment of Maxwell. and 
 I spoke yesterday about having a call to touch base about victims and notifications and such. It was pretty 
 much to get ahead of it before it happens so we aren't scrambling on who gets notified. We have plenty of time 
 before this happens as we won't even have a grand jury until later this summer.

 Hi-- I was speaking to Mandy earlier and she thought it may be a good idea to have a call soon 
 regarding potential case updates; and a discussion on how to handle victim notifications. 
 EFTA00037445
Let me know if you would like to discuss first prior to a group call. We were thinking that it may be better to 
 start discussing how to handle before it things become hectic again. 
 Sean - let us know your thoughts.

 Hey Sean, 
 EFTA00037449
Myself ands are requesting travel to London, accompanied by SDNY AUSA's for the week of March 
 16th. We expect to leave on the 17th and return on the 20th. The purpose of this trip is for the 
 interview/proffer of a witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's. The time and location for this interview has 
 been arranged by the witnesses attorney who has been historically been difficult about changes. Both the 
 witness and her attorney reside in London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview 
 could prove to be vital to the indictment of another co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein which is expected to go 
 to grand jury within a few weeks. This person was witness to and potentially participated in the sexual abuse 
 of minor victims by Jeffery Epstein and his co-conspirators. For these reasons we request to travel while 
 there is a temporary travel restrictions due to the corona virus. Below are the following expected expenses: 
 Airfare: $696 x 2 ($1392) 
 Hotel: $304 x 2 ($608) 
 Parking: $70 x 2 ($140) 
 Taxi: $100 x 2 ($200)

 The last time we spoke with the SSRA He advised there was nothing more they could do to verify her presence 
 there without going to the local PD. He said if we do that then it could potentially leak our interests and her 
 which could send her running. I have no problem with you going directly with the RA, But at the end of the 
 day we're going to wind up with the same answer, until we are able to go up on her phone and start getting 
 aggressive we will not be able to pin her down. Our last position was to wait until we are close to them green

 SDNY has told us that their management is positive about the memo they sent up the chain for GM but

 I've attached the request. As I mentioned, I plan to send it over with a very brief cover letter on Tuesday, after 
 discussions with the De ut Chief of Mission, the Ambassador (but only if he requests), and the Home Office. 
 Also, as I mentioned, recommends that there are no public announcements about the delivery of 
 the request until after the witness declines a voluntary interview. 
 I will follow this up next week with an email explaining the process which usually follows after the Home 
 Office receives an MLA request.

 about sending the materials to us so we could give them to a vendor, all of which he generally said would be fine and 
 asked us to memorialize it in an email to him, which we did more than five weeks ago, on May 7. Sometime after 
 that I guess FBI New York prevented them from sending the materials to us, and then another month passed before 
 you guys received the materials a week ago. Wanted to correct the distinction (though we also 
 contacted Mabout the materials generally as well).

We will get the status on the files asap, my understanding is the case file contained numerous volumes with 
 multiple boxes and they may be a bit disheveled as a result of the previous review. I recognize and appreciate 
 your urgency, I will make sure we get an answer today and get these files up here immediately. I spoke with my 
 ASAC and he's open to the idea of the third party scanning, but he wants the files coming here first to get an 
 accurate assessment before a decision is made. I assure you we are not going to sit on this, hopefully we can get 
 the files up here, if they are not already enroute, and move forward with the approvals for your vendor.

 Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago 
 we understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them 
 available for OPR several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. 
 Our understanding was that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the 
 case team identified when we visited back in January (that were in the possession o So I'm not sure 
 what still needs to be located? 
 And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a 
 resolution for sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will 
 happen when they get here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs 
 to know what the files consist of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to 
 whoever we need to in order to explain why it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us 
 (or even directly to the vendor), or at least to have the vendor plan approved to start immediately when the 
 materials arrive. 
 We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or 
 the criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these docs, but we initially 
 requested them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally 
 resolved it with the Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors 
 to have it resolved. 
 Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they 
 should call)? And thanks again for your help.

 Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—
 it's a number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly 
 to us so our paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way 
 to the New York field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been 
 scanned.

U.S. v. Cruz, overdose deat 
 In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they 
 keep all the information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a 
 desire to be able to continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a 
 problem. 
 Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants 
 to talk with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week. 
 thanks again

 I hope all is good in NY. 
 Please see attached document provided by NCA. Additionally, please advise whether any internal NSPCC investigation 
 into Care Iveagh would adversely affect your investigation. 
 Also, NCA has some financial intelligence regarding Epstein's NCA believes FBINY might 
 already be aware of this information as it is a U.S. bank account, but if this would be of interest, NCA can route to you via 
 FinCEN. 
 Please let us know how we can coordinate with NCA on your behalf.

 Wanted to quickly follow up on the below (and attached), and our call last week. From the hard drive you sent 
 that contained mostly mixed files, we ultimately were able to identify seven devices that appear to have been 
 conveyed in individual folders -- the following NYC numbers: 
 NYC024363 
 NYC024392 
 NYC024328 
 NYC024365 
 NYC024366 
 NYC024371 
 NYC024383 
 There are two things that are odd about this list, that we need clarification on, please. The first is, on your 
 spreadsheet, it says that NYC024392 was not yet ready and hadn't been provided to us. Did we get something 
 else under that number, or was the number incorrectly listed on the spreadsheet as incomplete? 
 And second, I don't see any listing at all for NYC024328 on the spreadsheet -- I believe the list goes 236, 237, 
 239. It's entirely possible I'm just missing it -- please let me know if so -- but if not, did you send us a device that 
 wasn't previously identified on the spreadsheet? And if so, are there other devices we should be expecting that 
 aren't currently listed? Or was it just a typo? Please let us know as soon as possible, since those seven folders are 
 all in the process of being sent to our vendor for processing into platform-readable files and uploading. 
 Also, are we still on track to receive all of the devices extracted individually on Wednesday? 
 thanks,

 Here you go. Almost everything is over at Southern once I drop off the phones. Just 1 laptop and 2 desktops to 
 EFTA00037475
get to you. I has to re-process, so I am not sure how long it will be as it is a large item. As far as the stuff I have 
 already produced, I can re-work it to split things out, but unsure how much static it will give me. Might be fast, 
 might be a pain. Unknown at this point, but I am sure we can get something moving. Any questions, let me

 Hey 
 I wanted to see if it would be possible to use case funds to purchase a 12TB hard drive to store digital evidence 
 on for the Epstein investigation? I think this could solve some of the CART hold ups. Pricing estimate from Best 
 Buy is $249.99. 
 Thanks,

 FYI, Judge Berman has officially announced the new courtroom for tomorrow's proceeding. We expect a large number 
 of victims will be coming to court and then back to over the bridge tomorrow. 
 Will you guys have additional agents/TFOs available to help coordinate tomorrow? If so, mind sending us their names 
 please?

 Subject: E stein Claims Fund Program 
 To: (NY) (FBI)" ca 
 Cc: 
 The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein has created a Claims Fund Program to compensate the victims of Mr. Epstein. If a victim was 
 abused by Mr. Epstein, she is eligible to participate in the Program. Victims are eligible to participate in the Program even 
 if their claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations or if they previously entered into a settlement agreement with 
 EFTA00037509
Jeffrey Epstein in the past, assuming other criteria is met. There is no cap or limitation on the amount of funds available 
 to the Program to compensate all eligible victims. 
 This Program is different from the lawsuits that have been filed or could be filed against the Estate. The Program is 
 voluntary, which means that each victim has the right to chose whether or not to participate. If the victim has a claim 
 that is not barred by the statute of limitations, she can choose to file a lawsuit and litigate her case rather than participate 
 in the Program. She can also choose to participate in the Program and litigate her case in Court at the same time. The 
 Program and the lawsuit are independent of one another. 
 The Program is run by Program Administrator Jordy Feldman. Each victim who chooses to participate in the Program will 
 submit her claim (comprised of the details of her abuse and proof of her damages). Ms. Feldman will then make a 
 determination as to the monetary value of her claim. Each claim will be evaluated separately, meaning the dollar 
 amounts awarded to compensate each victim will differ and are made irrespective of one another. 
 Ms. Feldman will run the Program independently from the Estate. This means that the Estate will not be involved in 
 determining the amount of compensation awarded to each claimant. Ms. Feldman will make those determinations on her 
 own without input from the Estate. The Estate will be provided with the names of the victims who submit claims to the 
 Program, but they will not have access to any evidence that each victim submits to support her claim. 
 After Ms. Feldman has evaluated a claim, she will issue a letter to the victim or her attorney including the amount of 
 compensation that the Program is willing to pay to compensate her. At that time, the victim can either accept the amount 
 of money being offered to her and sign a release precluding her from continuing any litigation or taking any further action 
 against the Estate, or she can reject the amount of money offered and, if she chooses and the remedy is legally available, 
 proceed with/file a lawsuit. 
 By way of brief relevant background, the Estate intended to have this Program approved by the Court in the USVI on 
 February 4. Shortly prior to the hearing, the Virgin Islands Attorney General filed a lien against the Estate preventing the 
 Program from beginning because she did not believe that the tenants of the Program were favorable to the victims. We 
 worked together with both the Estate and the USVI AG over the past few months to improve the Program so that the AG 
 would allow the Program to move forward. As you know, an agreement has been reached and the Program is moving 
 forward. The only reference that was made to the FBI in the Agreement is that Jordy Feldman, as Program Administrator, 
 will inform claimants that counseling is available to them through FBI Victim Services or other similar entities, as would be 
 available to them whether or not a Program existed. The FBI has not been obligated to do anything outside of the normal 
 course of business by way of the Agreement; your tremendous work on behalf of victims has only been highlighted. 
 I know that the news articles are often times inaccurate and can be confusing. Please let me know if you have any 
 questions or would like clarification on anything.

 AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
 compensation fund protocol 
 • Jun 1, 2020 
 Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
 over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
 release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
 George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
 victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
 The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
 having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
 new charges. 
 In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
 Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
 the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
 criminal sex trafficking operation. 
 As pan of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
 from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
 protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
 V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
 and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
 EFTA00037512
George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
 working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
 fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
 George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
 publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
 the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
 victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
 According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
 • Involvement of victim advocate Marci Hamilton, CEO of Child USA and the country's preeminent expert and 
 advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
 informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
 • Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
 claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
 • Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
 potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
 • Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
 • Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
 General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
 "The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
 victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
 release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
 choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
 committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
 used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
 The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
 funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
 expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
 "I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
 my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
 are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
 criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
 will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

 Hi - yes this is regarding the civil case. I will forward the information I receive soon as I get it. The civil 
 suit has been pressing the estate to let victims be eligible for compensation/ restitution. My understanding is the 
 AG in St. Thomas recently ruled in the victims favor. Will let you know soon as I have the specific information.

 Hi - yes this is regarding the civil case. I will forward the information I receive soon as I get it. The civil 
 suit has been pressing the estate to let victims be eligible for compensation/ restitution. My understanding is the 
 AG in St. Thomas recently ruled in the victims favor. Will let you know soon as I have the specific information.

 AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
 compensation fund protocol 
 • Jun 1, 2020 
 Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
 over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
 release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
 George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
 victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
 The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
 having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
 new charges. 
 In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
 Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
 the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
 criminal sex trafficking operation. 
 As part of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
 from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
 protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
 EFTA00037523
V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
 and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
 George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
 working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
 fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
 George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
 publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
 the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
 victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
 According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
 • Involvement of victim advocate and the country's preeminent expert and 
 advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
 informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
 • Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
 claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
 • Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
 potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
 • Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
 • Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
 General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
 "The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
 victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
 release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
 choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
 committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
 used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
 The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
 funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
 expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
 "I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
 my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
 are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
 criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
 will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

 Hey 
 I will check with our VSD personnel and get back to you. My guess is the fund would be used to pay for victim services as 
 recommended by the FBI but I couldn't say for sure.

 DOJ is asking about the victim compensation fund protocol, specifically the following aspect:

 Is this something FBINY was involved in? I've checked with VSD, but they are not aware of this.

 AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
 compensation fund protocol 
 • Jun 1, 2020 
 Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
 over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
 release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
 George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
 victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
 The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
 having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
 new charges. 
 In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
 Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
 the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
 criminal sex trafficking operation. 
 As part of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
 from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
 protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
 V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
 and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
 George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
 working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
 fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
 George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
 publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
 the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
 victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
 According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
 • Involvement of victim advocate and the country's preeminent expert and 
 advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
 informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
 • Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
 claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
 • Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
 potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
 • Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
 • Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
 General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
 EFTA00037536
"The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
 victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
 release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
 choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
 committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
 used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
 The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
 funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
 expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
 "I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
 my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
 are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
 criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
 will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

 All, 
 After much engagement with HQ over the past 48 hours, and our efforts to both consolidate and limit the 
 reporting requirements, HQ is now requesting updates in a conference call to be held daily at 1530. You 
 should all receive the bridge line information tomorrow. Trust me, nothing you're thinking right now hasn't 
 already been communicated to the highest levels. IMO, this is largely driven by DOI. Is it inconvenient? Yes. 
 Regardless, we'll need to support the calls because those you all deal with in CID are in the exact same 
 position as you. We should support each other and push through. 
 Based on all my calls with HQ, here are some of my thoughts on how we should go forward: 
 Many questions I'm receiving are driven by media reporting (e.g. Maxwell, NM residence search, etc.). If you 
 see sustained reporting on one aspect, get ahead of it. For example...media has been all over the location 
 and role of Maxwell as a co-conspirator. I advised that based on the volume and quality of evidence we have, 
 the team is currently focused on charges for a different co-conspirator. However, we're engaged with Counsel 
 for all co-conspirators. Kill the rumor before it gets legs in the minds of senior leadership. 
 With regard to interviews or other investigative techniques, stay general unless we have significant 
 information. You could say, "we conducted interviews of 14 MCC Corrections Officers and continued with the 
 financial analysis but don't have anything signficant to report." Only give names of an interviewee if there 
 was something significant. 
 If we don't have significant results to report, it's ok to say so. Be mindful that most, if not all, of what you say 
 will be pushed to the seventh floor. 
 - Tuesday is a big day with the hearing so be prepared to talk it on Monday and beyond. You can provide 
 the approximate number of victims expected to attend and any efforts we have in making that happen 
 (coordinating transportation, etc.). On Tuesday you'll give the read out of the hearing. In your reporting over 
 the next few days/weeks, stay focused on the investigation of the co-conspirators and stay tight with SDNY on 
 conversations they're having with Counsel and the direction we're headed towards charges. 
 and on Wednesday - I've continually expressed to HQ how C-19 and C-2 are tight on the 
 drug/sex case. You guys can speak together about that case. Clearly we're focused on analysis of the phones 
 as well as the nature and timing of likely charges. 
 - I talked to and know that you guys have a couple big interviews to do that will determine if the 
 PC case has any legs or if gets shut down. I would focus on advising of the timing of those interviews. 
 EFTA00037556
- I've included you here FYSA. Let me know if you want the bridge line details as well. 
 Enjoy your Sunday.

 Hello! 
 Below is the lead information mentioned. 
 • Caller Name: 
 • DOB: 
 • Number: 
 • Address: 
 • called on 7/15/19 and she stated she met Epstein through at Epstein's residence in NY. 
 She was El at the time. Caller said she welcomes a follow up by 
 This is the lead information: 
 [Caller stated when she was went to Epstein's townhouse in Manhattan, NY. Caller's friends, 
 had visited Epstein and told Caller about how it was easy money 
 Once they walked in, there was a massage 
 parlor to the right, and a secretary desk right in front of them. went into the massage parlor room, 
 where Epstein was already naked with a towel over him. Epstein told them to undress, and they undressed to their bras 
 and panties. Epstein, who was facing upwards, advised Caller to straddle him while she was massaging his abdomen. 
 Epstein then grabbed Caller by the hips and started moving her in an up and down motion. At this point Epstein's towel 
 was off, but Calle rwas still wearing her underwear. 
 Caller's and Epstein's genitals were rubbing against each other. Epstein then directed Caller to massage his testicles, while 
 simultaneously he had his fingers in panties. Caller was unsure if Epstein penetrated but he was at the 
 very least fondling her. Epstein continued to have Caller go up and down until eventually he ejaculated. Epstein then 
 thanked them, he left the room, and Caller and Leann got dressed. When they walked out, the secretary handed them 
 each an envelope. Caller believes there was between $250 and $300 in the envelope. Caller remembers the money was in 
 big bills. 
 Caller stopped speaking with =, was never close with and is still friends with on social media. Caller 
 did not know the name of the secretary but described her as being a middle aged Caucasian woman, with glasses and 
 brunette hair.] 
 Let me know if you need anything else!

 Hey guys, 
 Just a heads up when your liaison runs Maxwell though the TECS system we get a notification 
 email that someone at JFK is running her. Just please give us a heads up if your having someone else run her 
 name so there's no confusion that she may be leaving the country or there is some other investigation going 
 on. Her name has hit 3 times in the past month on TECS. 
 Thanks!

 No problem, we will start working on what we can today. I've CC'd for assistance with some of these 
 requests. 
 , would you be able to give us a hand with items 2-3 on this list as requested by the AUSA's. I've 
 performed an updated Accurint check on Maxwell search for any properties she owns with negative results. 
 Hoping maybe you can come up with something in your searches. Thanks!

 Hi and 
 In connection with the Maxwell investigation, I know this is a travel week, but if at all possible, are you able to assist with 
 the following? It would be great to get some of these in motion this week: 
 1) Are you able to spend some time reviewing the message pads seized from Epstein's residence, to search for any 
 messages left by (or regarding) any of the individuals relating to the GM case? In particular, it would be helpful to 
 know if there are messages relating to: 
 2) I recognize that we do not have a complete picture of Maxwell's current finances. I don't think it makes sense to 
 request additional financial information, but it would be helpful to have a snapshot of what we already know 
 about her current assets. In addition, it would be helpful to know if there are any significant transfers from 
 Epstein's account to Maxwell since 2005. Along the same line, a check for more recent alerts in FinCEN would be 
 helpful. 
 3) On the topic of assets, can you tell us what properties Maxwell currently owns? 
 4) Could you please send us the current tracking document for the hotline? It would be helpful for us to check 
 through the leads regarding Maxwell. 
 5) I think we emailed about this last month, but can you let us know how you know that she has UK and French 
 citizenship? 
 6) Could you please send us the notes from the interview? 
 Thanks in advance, and sorry to pile on, I know everyone is busy.

 Attachments: Travel_Doc_for Kevin_Maxwell.pdf 
 Good afternoon, 
 I've attached an inspection record for Kevin Maxwell as reference. His last listed flight (2/29/2020) was 
 INBOUND to Boston, however he is listed as not being on board. His last 5 flights have also been listed as not 
 being on board. Based on the inspection record being dated on 3/16/2020 it is unclear if he is in the US currently. 
 It was noted regarding COVID-19 he has a "travel history with a nexus to Great Britain". The document does not 
 specify if he was in the US trying to leave or trying to come to the US again in March. 
 Thanks, 
 Kimberly

 Please call when you get this information. 
 I have attached Registration information for N331JE and N722JE. N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is 
 just the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think 
 there is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in 
 court. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, 
 and leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or 
 more, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. 
 I have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. 
 I have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PII. I will send the password in a follow-on e-
 mail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I 
 have created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate 
 potentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I 
 created turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be 
 obtained at a later date. 
 As I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly 
 different from what was included in the original e-mail to me below.

 It was nice talking with you yesterday. Thanks for your assistance with this. Please see the below email of aircraft 
 information. 
 Below are the aircrafts we believe Maxwell has/had been using. The helicopter we know that she personally piloted, while 
 the jets we know her to be a passenger. You'll notice some of the aircrafts will be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as she 
 traveled with him frequently. Any information you are able to provide would be helpful. If there is additional passenger 
 manifests for each of these aircrafts we'd like to know that as well. I know we discussed that sometimes that's not 
 available. As you can imagine, this case is high profile, so I appreciate any discretion you can make on your part. 
 Please let me know if I left something out that would be able to assist you in any way.

 Hey guys, 
 Just a heads up when your liaison runs Maxwell though the TECS system we get a notification 
 email that someone at JFK is running her. Just please give us a heads up if your having someone else run her 
 name so there's no confusion that she may be leaving the country or there is some other investigation going 
 on. Her name has hit 3 times in the past month on TECS.

 Hi and 
 In connection with the Maxwell investigation, I know this is a travel week, but if at all possible, are you able to assist with 
 the following? It would be great to get some of these in motion this week: 
 1) Are you able to spend some time reviewing the message pads seized from Epstein's residence, to search for any 
 messages left by (or regarding) any of the individuals relating to the GM case? In particular, it would be helpful to 
 know if there are messages relating to: 
 2) I recognize that we do not have a complete picture of Maxwell's current finances. I don't think it makes sense to 
 request additional financial information, but it would be helpful to have a snapshot of what we already know 
 about her current assets. In addition, it would be helpful to know if there are any significant transfers from 
 Epstein's account to Maxwell since 2005. Along the same line, a check for more recent alerts in FinCEN would be 
 helpful. 
 3) On the topic of assets, can you tell us what properties Maxwell currently owns? 
 4) Could you please send us the current tracking document for the hotline? It would be helpful for us to check 
 through the leads regarding Maxwell. 
 5) I think we emailed about this last month, but can you let us know how you know that she has UK and French 
 citizenship? 
 6) Could you please send us the notes from the interview? 
 Thanks in advance, and sorry to pile on, I know everyone is busy.

 Hi everyone, 
 Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
 this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
 to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
 EFTA00037666
system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
 organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
 finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 EFTA00037667
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
 In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

 • NYC024394 
 • NYC024326 
 • NYC024368

 • NYC027908 
 Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
 teams.

 Squad C-20 is requesting assistance from two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to 
 help out one day next week, possibly Wednesday or Thursday. They have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her 
 defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could 
 potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team review the materials. Please let me know if you are able

 I am following the case against Ghislaine Maxwell with interest. 
 I understand that the many 'friends' of Epstein accused of abusing minors in court documents released in the 
 Ghislaine Maxwell proceedings will all get an opportunity to defend themselves. In other words deny all 
 wrongdoing. 
 I do not know if any accusations have been made about Nigel Oakes? He certainly runs in the same circles as 
 Trump and enjoys protection from within the Royal family. 
 He abused me when I was a child in the UK. In front of my sisters. 
 If any young woman have named him directly then I can save them from being accused of lying. Nigel Oakes is 
 a pedophile and a particularly bad one from my own experience. 
 EFTA00037679
I have tried to ascertain whether Nigel Oakes is on the Lolita Express flight logs but have not been able to 
 download this data. 
 Rich pedophiles stick together and Nigel Oakes could easily know Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell 
 socially and in business.

 PS might be under a gag order, but I'm not. Neither are other people I'm aware of who 
 were given copies of her phone logs back when we were trying to make sure ABC was kept "honest".

I keep thinking that someone is going to be contacting me about the Jeff Epstein case, and the connection 
 between his case/death and that of Jeanne Palfrey, the DC Madam, and her death, which I also believe was a 
 murder, and yet no one is. Maybe what's obvious to me isn't so obvious to other people, so I thought I'd reach 
 out to you to make contact now that you've gotten ahold of Ms. Maxwell. Jeanne Palfrey tried desperately 
 to get the names of her clients published in her lawsuit because her case was not what it appeared to be. Not 
 according to the story she told me anyway as someone who spoke to her almost daily for the last couple of 
 years of her life, and up to just a few hours before she was found dead. I believe she was murdered because 
 of the great effort many people were putting forth to keep the names in her phone logs quiet, as well as what 
 she was trying to say about her case that was being concealed in the media despite all the noise. Because she 
 wasn't getting her story told her way, that's why she had plans to publish her own book, her own documentary, 
 etc., using money she was supposed to have been awarded by Larry Flynt she was due to receive before she 
 was found dead. If her case was suicide, then the things that have been happening to me after her death to 
 harass me, and keep me out of the media talking about her story I doubt would have been as aggressive as 
 they were. Including the so called fact there was an "investigation" into her murder - when I had texts and 
 emails from her again on an almost daily basis for those last few years yet not one detective on her case, nor 
 has one single reporter, ever asked me to see any of these nor asked me anything about her side of the story or 
 her death despite the fact I was her only best friend, she gave me a copy of her logs, and that I was the only 
 one who heard her side of the story before her death. She had been arranging to hold a press conference to 
 release names, and also again tell her story about why she was REALLY arrested at the airport as she was 
 trying to leave the country, when she was calling me frantic because she was being followed all day the day 
 before she was found dead. Her own mother told me she was scared whoever murdered her daughter would 
 "come back and shut her up" if she didn't go along with the whole "suicide" cover story, so she begged me to 
 keep quiet also about her true feelings. Jeanne was called upon to supply women to the very men over the 
 same period of time as this case involving Epstein, and further, she was arrested and murdered during the 
 same time period that there were many people trying to keep Epstein from even facing charges. There is a 
 LOT of evidence in her phone logs, and that's probably why ABC lied about what was in them until we 
 proved they were lying. Even now, most of the names that were in those logs have not come to light. For all 
 we know, Ms. Maxwell might have been just as forced to do what she was doing for Epstein and his friends as 
 Jeanne was. Jeanne believed Brandy Britton was murdered also to keep her quiet about this same circle of 
 men. There is honestly every possibility that Dennis Hof might have even been murdered, as well as Joe 
 Conforte. Joe Conforte is missing, which means his body is in pieces somewhere. Joe was in contact with 
 just about everyone who was involved in the sex industry there was in the world. So was Dennis. Dennis' 
 death also stank to high heaven, especially when you see how his pilot met a strange end just weeks after 
 Dennis did. Dennis was being harassed also, and was scared for his life which was why he was hiding out in 
 Crystal on his birthday. He had told me he was not getting his voice heard in the media either, just as Jeanne's 
 wasn't, and I wasn't, and that's one of the reasons why he ran for office. He felt if he ran for office then the 
 major media couldn't shut him up - but then he is found dead practically the day after he wins the election? 
 If his death was properly investigated then please answer me as to why Heidi Fliess admitted to giving him an 
 edible the night before, yet the sheriff refused to take a sample of that edible when she was there? Why was 
 my home attacked just a few weeks after Hors death by four Metro officers without a warrant? I mean they 
 spent 90 minutes trying to tear my door off the hinges to get at me without a warrant or probable cause, and 
 when a reporter contacted them asking why they were there - they ran. There is a lot more to this story Ms. 
 Strauss, and there are answers in Jeanne's phone logs. Hopefully her death will not be in vein if you'll take a 
 careful look at those records. I think there was also something in Dennis Hofs records as well worth 
 checking out to be honest. Remember, the legal age for sex in Nevada is 16 years of age. Thank you for your 
 work on this case.

 Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
 this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
 to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
 system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
 organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
 finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

11111111111 :tcejbuSS[EXTERNAL EMAIL] Epstein Image ideo File Review Protocol 
 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
 In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
 • NYC024363 
 • NYC024394 
 • NYC024326 
 • NYC024368 
 • NYC024390 
 • NYC024334 
 • NYC027910 
 • NYC024323 
 • NYC024355 
 • NYC027908 
 Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
 teams. 
 Thanks very much

 Thank you. Are you able to update this with the new information from UBS? In particular, it would be helpful to 
 know how the Montpelier Trust was funded, and what expenditures it is making. 
 Thanks!

 received additional productions from UBS. The attached draft analysis is to be used for discussion purposes only 
 and is subject to change.

 As requested please see the summary of some of the findings contributing to the likelihood of 
 being associated with GHISILAINE. 
 Mark — please kindly jump in if you understand any of this to be incorrect of have info to add. 
 1. of NYO informed me of a social media post generally detailing the concept that 
 GHISILAINE's sister, formed an LLC with SCOTT BORGERSON. The social media post 
 deatiled the fact that GHISLAINE lived with BORGERSON until 2019. The social media post also 
 detailed an LLC named "ANGARA, LLC". 
 2. of NYO also informed me of a significant amount of money (I believe approximately 20 
 million dollars) was sent from an account known to be associated with GHISLAINE to an entity called 
 "ANGARA", potentailly ANGARA TRUST. 
 3. Open source records viewed re ardin Bradford NH indicated the owner to 
 be GRANITE REALTY LLC of Boston, MA 
 4. Upon further inspection it was found that the Massachusetts division of cor orations records for 
 ANGARA, LLC are associated with an entity located at Boston MA and an 
 individual named ADAM GHANDER. The entity was also associated with NUTTER, MCLELLEN & FISH 
 LLP. 
 5. Said social media post also detailed that ADAM GHANDER is the registered owner of TIDEWOOD LLC 
 who purchased a mansion in Massachusetts where GHISLAINE had been staying since leaving NY. 
 6. Upon further in spection it was found that corporation records associated with TIDEWOOD LLC are 
 associated with ADAM GHANDER and . The entity was also associated with 
 NUTTER, MCLELLEN & FISH LLP. 
 7. Open source records confirmed TIDEWOOD LLC was the owner of an address also associated with 
 SCOTT BORGERSON. 
 It is the aggregate of all of these common entities in corporation filings, fragmented open source reporting 
 coupled with known historical telephone communications from GHISILANE to NUTTER, MCCLENNEN & FISH 
 LLP that contribute to the high likelihood that is affiliated with GHISILAINE.

 To Whom it May Concern: 
 We are in receipt of Amazon's responses to the attached grand jury subpoena (the "Subpoena"), which were submitted 
 several weeks past the return due date. 
 We note with concern that the Subpoena responses list more than 300 descriptions of responsive materials as 
 "REDACTED." Please immediately produce either a complete response to the Subpoena without the redaction of non-
 privileged responsive materials, or provide a legal basis for your refusal to do so, so that we may seek court intervention 
 as necessary. 
 We further note that Amazon has explicitly reserved objections including that the information and/or records requested 
 are unusually voluminous in nature and that compliance would cause an undue burden for Amazon. Please advise 
 immediately whether Amazon is in fact exercising any of these objections in its response to this Subpoena specifically; 
 that is, whether Amazon has failed to produce responsive materials based on volume or burden. Please also advise 
 whether Amazon has refused to provide any responsive materials for any reason, other than the "REDACTED" materials as 
 described above. 
 Finally, we note that the Subpoena requested any and all records associated with nine email addresses, and the response 
 appears to include materials in connection with just two email addresses. Please confirm that Amazon comprehensively 
 reviewed its records for each of the other seven email accounts and found no responsive materials. Similarly, the 
 Subpoena requested account notes and logs, including any customer service communications or other correspondence. 
 No such records were produced. Please confirm that Amazon comprehensively reviewed its records for any such 
 materials and that none were found. 
 If it is useful to discuss these issues via phone, I can be reached at 212-637-2415 and my colleague Alison Moe can be 
 reached at 212-637-2225. IF YOU CALL AND LEAVE A MESSAGE PLEASE PROVIDE A RETURN PHONE NUMBER AT WHICH 
 WE MAY REACH YOU.

 Good afternoon, 
 Amazon's response to the attached grand jury subpoena is overdue by several weeks. The FBI has emailed and left 
 messages with your legal department several times over the past weeks without a response. 
 Please respond promptly to resolve Amazon's non-compliance. Otherwise we will initiate contempt proceedings 
 regarding your failure to comply with valid legal process.

 Hi M, 
 As per our telephone conversation earlier, I can confirm that I made contact with via her mobile on Friday 
 16th August 2019. At that time, she confirmed that she was willing to cooperate in the capacity as a witness but she 
 wanted to know if a lawyer could be provided and if a list of questions could be made available in advance. 
 I then received two emails from on Friday 16th August 2019; in the first email she asked if it would be possible for 
 her to have a senior community support officer with her at the proposed meeting with the FBI. In the second email 
 stated that she did not need a lawyer. She explained that she got very uncomfortable as she has never been part 
 of an investigation before and this case has been very ugly. She just wants to assist to the best of her abilities. If there 
 would be a lawyer in the room, then that would be great and if not, then she was fine with that too. 
 Today, Monday 19th August 2019 I received a telephone call from via her mobile. She advised me that she was 
 no longer willing to assist the FBI for a number of reasons; Jeffrey Epstein is dead, she has to think about her own 
 safety, there is no added value for the FBI speaking to her and she has concerns over confidentiality, fearing that her 
 name will land up on Twitter, like others involved.

 Contact has been made and is amenable to be interviewed. However, she asked for three things, two of which require 
 your input, the third related to location of the proposed interview and the MET has offered their space to which she was 
 agreeable. Her questions are as follows: 
 1. Will an attorney be provided for her as she doesn't have the finances to hire her own 
 2. Can she have a list of questions beforehand 
 Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.

 This is interesting. The mansion was the home of a school until Leslie Wexner bought it in 1989 — at least according to a 
 number of public reports. He remodeled it, and it was featured (as Wexner's house) in Architectural Digest in 1995. As 
 of 1996, Epstein told the New York Times that the house was his. 
 But it doesn't look like there's any record of the property changing ownership between 1989 and 2012, and the sale in 
 1989 is to "Nine East 71st Street Corporation." Then 13 years later, that corporation, with Epstein as the president, 
 transfers title to another Epstein entity. So did he own it that entire time, rather than Wexner, as had been 
 advertised?? Or did Wexner own it through a corporation for which Epstein was the president until 2012? 
 Can we pull the equivalent documents to these for the 1989 title transfer?

 Hi 
 I have a question about the locations where the assaults occurred. 
 Did any assaults happen on Great St Jim , aka "Great St James Island"? 
 This island was acquired on January 18th and January 21st, 2016, in two separate deeds by "Great St Jim LLC", 
 which I believe is an Epstein entity.

 this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access

 system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
 organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
 finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
 In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
 • NYC024363 
 • NYC024394 
 • NYC024326 
 • NYC024368 
 • NYC024390 
 • NYC024334 
 • NYC027910 
 • NYC024323 
 • NYC024355 
 • NYC027908 
 Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
 teams. 
 Thanks very much,

 Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - Epstein Image/Video File Review Protocol 
 All, 
 Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
 reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
 the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
 Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
 call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

 I wanted to send a follow-up email about the device review. See below on who is covering what device. Happy to talk 
 through and sit down with those of you I haven't. Everyone should be set up by end of day today to have access to the

 Hi everyone, 
 Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
 this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
 to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
 system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
 images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
 click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found

 None of the 911 calls were relevant. But here are some additional reports I pulled from that DAS search. 
 One contains information for an employee of 9 E 71 Street and the second is the property manager of the

 Much appreciated. Two quick questions: 
 1) Are you able to pull the supporting sprint reports for the 911 calls reported in the DAS report, or do we need to 
 subpoena NYPD communications? 
 2) Are you able to run a DAS search with Epstein's phone number (212-533-3739) as well? Thanks.

 It looks like the subscriber records for the number start in November 2005, and the messages we looked at 
 with the number are from October 2005. Looking at the tolls, those start in '04.

 Hi 
 Hope you're doing well. In connection with the Epstein investigation, we were wondering if you could possibly 
 send us the search warrant affidavit and order for the Epstein residence. We understand that it was executed by 
 local authorities before the case was brought to the FBI, but we understand you have a copy in the files, and we 
 can't seem to locate it in the materials we've reviewed. If you could please email it to us, that would be a big 
 help. 
 Thanks in advance for your help, we really appreciate it.

SITUATION 
 • It is anticipated that on July 2, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein will be indicted on two counts of 18 USC 1591, Sex 
 Trafficking of Children and Conspiracy to engage in human trafficking. 
 • In conjunction with the arrest of Epstein, a lis pendens will be filed on Epstein's Manhattan residence 
 (reportedly the largest private residence in Manhattan, spanning an entire city block) as the initial step 
 toward seizure. 
 BACKGROUND 
 • In 2005, the West Palm Beach Police Department, and then the FBI, initiated an investigation of Jeffrey 
 Epstein after parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein had abused their daughter 
 between 2002 and 2005. Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among 
 other things, interviews with approximately 35 victims; a search warrant executed on Epstein's Florida 
 residence; and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. 
 • In 2007, after attorneys representing Epstein met with Alex Acosta, United States Attorney for the 
 Southern District of Florida, Epstein was offered a non-prosecution agreement which required Epstein to 
 plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution, which he did in 2008. He was sentenced to 
 18 months in jail, was permitted to serve his sentence in a facility where he was released during the day 
 to work, and was released from his sentence after serving approximately 13 months. 
 • This non-prosecution agreement garnered significant media attention as Alex Acosta is currently serving 
 as Secretary of Labor and the investigation was raised during his US Senate confirmation hearing. 
 • In December 2018, SDNY approached the FBI NY to open an investigation into Epstein regarding his 
 conduct in New York. 
 • Epstein has had significant connections to New York City for many years. In addition to his residence, 
 Epstein's professional career has been centered in part in New York. He was an investor in a modeling 
 agency based in New York City, and during the relevant period spent significant time at his Manhattan 
 mansion. As described by at least one individual (' ), who was victimized and recruited dozens 
 of other minor victims in New York City, Epstein reportedly victimized dozens of girls in New York, in 
 addition to the dozens of girls he victimized in Florida. Epstein knew that was under the age of 
 18, and he knew the other girls she was bringing were under 18. In particular, recalls having 
 truthfully told Epstein that she was 14 years old, and recalls Epstein being upset if she brought him girls 
 who looked like they were 18 or older. 
 • Agents and SDNY AUSAs have traveled to Florida on multiple occasions to interview victims. The 
 identified victims' ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been 
 approximately 15 or 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. Epstein's 
 conduct included masturbating in front of victims; fondling the breasts of victims; placing a vibrator on 
 the genitals of victims; and directly touching the genitals of victims. Victims would have to perform 
 these massages nude or partially nude. Victims were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they 
 went to Epstein's residence. Two of the victims ("MI and n were interviewed in Florida 
 and both have reported the above listed conduct. Like estimated bringing dozens of 
 girls to Epstein. Epstein's conduct reportedly occurred in locations including, but not limited to, New 
 York City, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. 
 • Victims in New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for 
 Epstein to arrange his "massages." In New York, one of those individuals was-; in Florida, the 
 primary contact for the girls was . Additionally, and in order to maintain a steady stream of 
 underage girls to perform sexual acts, Epstein and his co-conspirators also coerced others, including 
 EFTA00037799
some of his victims, to recruit other minor girls to engage in "massages" and sexual conduct with 
 Epstein. The recruiters were paid by Epstein and co-conspirators for bringing additional minor girls to 
 Epstein's properties for those purposes. 
 STRATEGY 
 • The NYO is coordinating a robust plan to interview a significant number of co-conspirators and victims in 
 the hours/days following the arrest of Epstein. 
 • Efforts are ongoing toward the seizure of Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida 
 (total value of approximately $100M). 
 • SDNY and NYO will coordinate a press conference during which a tip line will be announced to 
 encourage other victims to report their encounters with Epstein. 
 • NYO will coordinate with VSD regarding the victim interviews.

 This was from a while back, but wanted to follow up on the question of physical evidence. I've reviewed the list (I thought 
 it was really difficult to read, so I reformatted it significantly, though without any substantive changes — see attached) and 
 I think the answer is we should have everything transferred up here with the exception of extremely large items. 
 Specifically, I think at this stage we do not need to be housing the following: 
 1B2 — 31: Green massage table 
 182 —43: Peach massage table 
 181 —6: Beige massage table 
 181 — 7: Brown massage table 
 Also, for some of the entries there are numbers next to the descriptions in parentheses. For most of those, it looks like 
 either the number of the type of thing or just a repeat of the sub-number of the various item numbers in the first 
 column. For item number 1B2, a bunch of the entries have numbers (following the descriptions) that don't seem to be 
 either of those things. Is there any significance to those numbers?? I just want to make sure there are no issues with our 
 records of what exists. 
 Let us know if any questions or issues — and obviously anybody please say the word if you disagree about holding off on 
 bringing up the massage tables — and thanks.

 I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport 
 (KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
 Flight plans indicate N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 
 2019 it operated from 
 Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
 It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan. 
 I attached the pertinent aircraft registration records for N212JE. 
 The aircraft has been registered since March 2017 to; 
 Plan D LLC 
 St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Island 
 The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager 
 I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. he is a pilot 
 phone: 
 I don't see EPSTEIN name on any of the paperwork. 
 There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN. 
 I also attached a picture of N212JE.

 — SIT — worked on JEs property for a week and her Fiancé just recently quit. Stated 
 a female named '=" knows all JEs secrets. JE also gave his pilots apartments on STT (Location unknown) 
 but near the airport under one of his companies' names. 
 works for Air Traffic Control in . Worked as ATC for STT from about March 2018 —April 
 2019. Stated she has seen JE with underage girls getting off his jet and then flying them via his helicopter 
 to his island during time frame she worked there. Maybe she saw other people? 
 ATC on STT — stated similar things as above. 
 EFTA00037809
can find you more people who used to / still work on the island. Remember that these people all signed 
 the 1 million dollar Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and prior to JEs death were petrified to talk with us. Maybe 
 that has changed. 
 Again, I was investigating his international travel. The responses from other countries stated he was traveling with 
 people on his jet but I did not receive their identities. We had the MLAT requests ready to send this week but then 
 Saturday happened. On March 22, 2019 Austria did confirm that JE landed with 3 females, had coffee at The Coffee 
 House Landmann, then got back on his Jet and left. It is possible to get the identities of these people through the 
 MUT request. If you want any of the other countries, let me know and I can send you the dates and places.

 Dear and 
 I am a DCI in the Met Police in London, and have been given your contact details by DCI who I 
 understand did some work with you back in 2021 in relation to the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine 
 Maxwell. 
 As you may be aware, there has been significant media reporting in the UK about (former) Prince Andrew and 
 his activities both with and efforts he has allegedly made to get information about her through 
 his protection officers. 
 The UK media also appear to be in possession of certain material from the Oversight Committee, including flight 
 manifests from when JE arrived in the UK with other passengers and further allegations around trafficking etc. 
 I am reviewing these allegations, and wanted to enquire if you still had any active investigations in relation to 
 this matter, and if your team had any involvement in the Oversight Committee hearings and any material being 
 presented there. 
 If it would be beneficial to arrange a meeting please let me know, or alternatively if you are no longer involved 
 with this case, I would be grateful of any contact details you have for anyone currently involved in the matter. 
 Kind Regards

 I was the chief of the Palm Beach Police Department durin the entirety of its investigation of Jeffrey 
 Epstein. I obtained your contact information from I of the DOJ Office of Professional 
 Responsibility. 
 I understand that you are the case agent for the New York Field Office in the Jeffery Epstein case and 
 subsequent investigation of coconspirators now that Epstein is dead. Please call me at 
 as I believe that I am in possession of information that is germane to your investigation that you may 
 not otherwise be aware and I feel compelled to pass to you or someone at the FBI who is working on 
 this case. 
 Thank you.

 Great. Thank you! We don't need to record them. It will be my partner and I, along with 2 AUSAs, so if the soft room 
 will fit all of us that will work. We've been able to coordinate availability with the victims and it would be 10am on

 Hi 
 We can accommodate that. When you write your concurrence to travel EC, just send in the lead that you request the 
 assistance of LA for meeting room space. Do you need to record these interviews? We have a soft room here that you can 
 use that has recording equipment or we can find you a conference room if you prefer. Are the interviews already pre-
 arranged for a set time so we can block off the rooms for you? We can arrange for you to get access to the building too so 
 you won't have to be escorted. 
 Let us know what you need.

 Hi 
 My partner and I are traveling to California next week to interview victims for the Epstein investigation. I was hoping to 
 ask for your assistance in using a conference room or soft room or interview room to conduct these interviews on 
 Wednesday 9/18 and Thursday 9/19. I briefly spoke with Al and he said that you were the person to coordinate with. 
 Would that be possible to have an available room?

 I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) 
 in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
 Flight plans indicate N2 I2JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July I1, 
 2019 it operated from 
 Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
 It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan. 
 EFTA00037855
I attached the pertinent aircraft registration records for N212JE. 
 The aircraft has been registered since March 2017 to; 
 Plan D LLC 
 St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Island 
 The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager 
 I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. dot he is a pilot 
 phone: 
 I don't see EPSTEIN name on any of the paperwork. 
 There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN. 
 I also attached a picture of N212JE.

 I appreciate the heads up brother. I'll make sure this gets forwarded on to the case agents. Interestingly enough, I 
 remember that plane from when I was in San Juan division and use to see it on the signature ramp at St Thomas when 
 we would fly over. One of the agents pointed it out to me as belonging to Epstein, back then.

 I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) in

 It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan.

 Hi all, 
 Thanks for volunteering to help tomorrow. As of right now, if people could be on standby around 9:30/10 to help 
 with victims. Some victims will be meeting at SDNY before the hearing so we may need some help corralling 
 them and getting them to the courthouse without the press. I'd say for now to hang around 290 and I should have 
 a better idea in the morning.

 Thanks for your follow up. 
 This is a video of one of the buildings that was posted to You Tube by somebody named Rusty Shackleford (file 
 purports to be taken 7/7, but in any event it was posted to You Tube on July 17, 2019) @ 1:50 et seq. you can 
 clearly see a computer on one of the tables

 EFTA00037882
Here's another video of the same room taken by drone, and posted to YT (file purports to be dated 8/3, but in 
 any event it was uploaded to You Tube on August 6). @ 1:03... same room, but no computer 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxOFa2EupB8
 Both videos were taken and posted prior to the publicized raid on the island on 8/13/19. 
 So unless you guys can account for the movement of the computer, somebody not in law enforcement moved 
 it. Obviously this raises questions of conspiracy and obstruction at a minimum. 
 I want the investigation aware of this information that is in the public domain, and that is widely discussed 
 among people skeptical of the Epstein prosecution and suicide.

 Judgment —Page 
 DEFENDANT: Hector Emilio Fernandez-Rosa 
 CASE NUMBER: 12-cr-894-2 
 4 of 6 
 STANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION 
 As part of your supervised release, you must comply with the following standard conditions of supervision. These conditions arc imposed 
 because they establish the basic expectations for your behavior while on supervision and identify the minimum tools needed by probation 
 officers to keep informed, report to the court about, and bring about improvements in your conduct and condition. 
 I. You must report to the probation office in the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside within 72 hours of your 
 release from imprisonment, unless the probation officer instructs you to report to a different probation office or within a different time 
 frame. 
 2. After initially reporting to the probation office, you will receive instructions from the court or the probation officer about how and 
 when you must report to the probation officer, and you must report to the probation officer as instructed. 
 3. You must not knowingly leave the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside without first getting permission from the 
 court or the probation officer. 
 4. You must answer truthfully the questions asked by your probation officer. 
 5. You must live at a place approved by the probation officer. If you plan to change where you live or anything about your living 
 arrangements (such as the people you live with), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying

 Hello Downstater. See below for a message from a co-chair of the coalition regarding a march for the CVA on 
 9/28, a female adult sexual assault group announcement from CVTC, and a job posting from the Justice 
 Center. 
 Dear Downstate Coalition Members: 
 I hope you are well and are enjoying the last weeks of summer. I am writing to invite you to join Safe Horizon 
 for a march up Fifth Avenue on September 28th to raise awareness about the Child Victims Act and to support 
 survivors. Since launching our PSA campaign in Times Square last week to highlight the beginning of the one 
 year "window" on August 14th that allows older survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file retrospective civil 
 lawsuits, we have seen a spike in interest and energy around the issue. Our plan is to channel that energy and 
 also reach more survivors and family members who might be looking for community and resources. The 
 march will take place on Saturday, September 28th (we are still finalizing the start time for the march) and will 
 proceed up Fifth Avenue from St. Patrick's Cathedral (between 50th 
 & 51st street) 
 to Jeffrey Epstein's former 
 home on E. 77th Street. 
 Please let me know if you and/or colleagues are interested in joining us on Sept. 28th. It would be great if you 
 could also spread the word about the event with your supporters. 
 Thanks so much, and please let me know if you have any questions or would like more information about the 
 Child Victims Act,  the look-back window, or anything else. You can reach me at 
 kp j safehorizon.org
 With best wishes,

I appreciate the heads up brother. I'll make sure this gets forwarded on to the case agents. Interestingly enough, I 
 remember that plane from when I was in San Juan division and use to see it on the signature ramp at St Thomas when 
 we would fly over. One of the agents pointed it out to me as belonging to Epstein, back then.

 Please be reminded that per policy and the T&A Handbook any employee hired for overtime prior to the administrative 
 workweek, is entitled to any applicable night differential in addition to the overtime pay. This results in a notable increase in 
 overtime costs. Therefor, unless otherwise unavoidable, the practice of hiring overtime prior to the administrative work week 
 should be avoided. Specifically, the administrative work week begins at 12:01 am Sunday, so if you hire overtime on 
 Saturday for the following Sunday or beyond, it is scheduled prior to the administrative workweek. The verbiage below is cut 
 and paste from the T&A Handbook, if you have further questions please contact me. 
 Regularly Scheduled Overtime. Overtime (over 8 in a day, over 40 in a week, or 
 over 80 in a pay period), which has been scheduled, both day(s) and hours, 
 prior to the administrative workweek for a specific employee. This overtime 
 must be scheduled before the Sunday of the week in which it was worked to be 
 considered "regularly scheduled." This is the only type of overtime that may 
 be subject to GS night differential, if worked between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M. It is 
 the only type of overtime (besides INS 1931 Act Overtime) that may be paid 
 to recipients of annual premium pay.

 Capt, please ensure the Lts are aware they should immediately discontinue the practice of placing inmates in observation 
 that are not on official Psych Ops or Suicide Watch status. Per the below guidance, inmates will not be placed in the suicide 
 area unless authorized by Psych staff. If an inmate arrives after hours and has to be screened, the inmate should be placed in 
 SHU until UT and medical staff arrive in the am and conduct the social and medical screening process. Please have a verbal 
 discussion and send out guidance.

 This morning the new Warden addressed new procedures: 
 1. The new Warden indicated he is very hands on and wants to know everything going on. He indicated every time 
 someone goes on or off suicide watch and psychology observation he wants to be informed by phone (in addition to the 
 emails we send out) You can call the office or his cell, . He wants to be called no matter what day or time it is. 
 2. The Warden indicated he would like to be the one making the decisions regarding the use of inmate companions. So 
 please make sure when someone is placed on suicide watch or psychology, a conversation is had with him regarding if it 
 should be a staff watch or inmate companion watch. 
 3. As it was brought up we are not always informed of inmates being placed on watch/observation, when they go on 
 overnight, he related, there would now be biweekly department head meetings and Dr. should bring this up at the 
 meeting so he can address this. She should also bring up we are not always getting PSIQs. 
 Thank you.

 Dear, Warden welcome on board M.C.C. New YORK, we spoke the other day on 10South High security unit. I just wanted to 
 run this by you, the bunk beds in the S.H.U. unit are not centered in the middle of the cell. Making it very difficult in seeing 
 the inmate in the cell, especially at night If it could be done to weld the bunk in the center of the cell, it would make the 
 inmate more visible and better seen during counts and rounds.

 When management is aware that OIG, FBI or the US Attorneys Office will arrive to start interviews; please 
 inform the local. That is not investigation sensitive information but it allows us to effectuate the availability of 
 representatives in the event employees request one, in accordance with their Weingarten Rights.

 Once the employee invokes their Weingarten rights, questioning is to stop and the employee seeks their 
 representative. The Local President determines the representative for the employee, not the agency or its 
 representative.

 What do you mean I don't have the authority to remove myself from the roster? I informed you weeks ago about this surgery 
 that I'm having on Monday and Fm not coming in on Monday so this isn't news and you didn't request documentation about 
 my surgery. I really don't have to provide specific information about my surgery that's why there's HIPPA laws and time for 
 recovery varies from individual to individual everyone is different. You were informed about this surgery so I 
 don't know why there is an issue and you are requesting documentation last minute all of a sudden this should of been 
 requested weeks ago.

 the visitor who was identified as if she had any intentions on giving inmate anything prohibited she 
 stated " Yes it's wrap up, I don't know what it is but I can take it out ". I then ask for female staff to take her in a private 
 area so she could forfeit the items. 3 bundles wrapped in electric tape containing a cellphone, tobacco, pills, marijuana,

 Hi guys, 
 Today I was Acting Captain and it was bought to the Operation's Lieutenant's attention as well as management that the 
 current overtime procedures are not being implemented. Please get back to the current hiring procedures that were put into 
 place back in May and fill as much of the overtime as possible. Hopefully this will eliminate us having so many vacancies on 
 the roster although we know there are no guarantees. Additionally, D/W Ops. (Sunday) and E/W Ops. (Wednesday) please 
 1/4/2019 10:08 AM > » 
 EFTA00036411
annotate in your daily lieutenant's log that the overtime hiring procedures were completed. Thank you as always for a job 
 well done! 
 > > 5/25/2018 9:09 AM >>> 
 Reminder of procedures in place. 
 1) Each Wednesday, the D/W Operations Lieutenant will fill overtime for the following Sunday utilizing the overtime sign up 
 list. Once the overtime sign up list has been exhausted any remaining vacancies can be filled with anyone that volunteers. If 
 the D/W Lieutenant is not able to complete filling Sunday's overtime vacancies, during their shift on Wednesday, the E/W 
 Operations Lieutenant will finish whatever is remaining. 
 2) Each Sunday, the D/W Operations Lieutenant will fill all overtime vacancies for the week (Monday thru Saturday) utilizing 
 the overtime sign up list. Once the overtime sign up list has been exhausted any remaining vacancies can be filled with 
 anyone that volunteers. If the D/W Lieutenant is not able to complete filling overtime vacancies for the week, on Sunday, the 
 E/W Operations Lieutenant will finish whatever is remaining. 
 3) On Saturday and Sunday, PRIOR TO MANDATING STAFF, the Operations Lieutenant on each shift will have the Control 
 Center send a message via the Ops Planner to all staff announcing there is overtime available. The announcement will only 
 be done once, per shift, and if there are no volunteers after the announcement is made you will begin mandating staff.

 how about taking some input from the individual(s) who actually install and maintain the equipment. They just might 
 know a little bit and surprise the people behind Fitara with what they know; the more options the better. Each 
 Institution knows what works for them.

 Here in Victorville FCI 1 we have had Nice since 2006 and it has been amazing. We got an update in 2014 and it has 
 been a really solid system. In 2017 they replaced a Viconet system at the FCI 2 that was in really bad shape. Since their 
 upgrade they have been really happy. I did not have any of these problems you guys are experiencing now. I'm 
 guessing it has to do with the Windows upgrade. Once these issues are ironed out Fm sure you guys will love your new 
 Nice system like we do here in Victorville. It has been the best Camera system I have ever worked with. Just give it a 
 chance!

 Looking for some help or advice from anyone using NICEVision. I just tried logging into Administrator to unlock an 
 account and I get a pop up that states "Database Error." I click "ok," and it closes the application. I'm getting the error 
 on the AMS as well as a BOPNet computer that is running the NICEVision software. I reached out to Justin Houston but 
 he is out of the office and I haven't heard back from anyone at the tech support number he left. If anyone has any ideas 
 or has experienced this error, I'd appreciate any advice or guidance to fix it. 
 Thanks in advance.

some last minute plans (THANK YOU VERY MUCH). Graduates welcome to the ERT T4T group. Please remember do not 
 give away to future T4T's our Thursday surprise. Next class is January and it will start our FY20 classes. I have sent out to a 
 first round of T4T's to schedule them for the FY20 classes to come out to MSTC and get them re-certified. I am not getting a 
 lot of responses so I will be moving on to the next names shortly to request you to come out and re-certify. I want to get 
 started on the classes as soon as possible. IF you get to go to a CMT as a ERT T4T to re-certify PLEASE let me know so I can 
 update the master list. 
 Please also let me know if you transfer to another institution so I can keep the Master list up to date. 
 Their has been a lot of questions about the CD burner lately and which one is authorized to get. As long as you are NOT 
 going to be connecting it to the BOP Network or any BOP Computer, your facility/IT can approve it without going through 
 Central Office. We are only making a recommendation and NOT ordering or mandating that you get them. It will however 
 make it easier for you when you need to make copies of the photos that you took during the Crime Scene. IF you get the 
 single CD burner you will have different times on the Chain of Custody for when the CD was created (found). IF you are able 
 to find the multi CD Burner and the CD's all come out at the same time then you would have the same times on the Chain of 
 Custody. 
 Info is coming in that the CD Burner that we recommended is no longer available and is outdated. from FCI 
 Tucson did a little leg work and found the attached model that is a single bumer and portable (Nice work).

 Supervisory CLC Attorney EMAIL: ADDRESS: 150 PARK ROW New York 
 NEW YORK NY 10007 RE: Obligation to Preserve Records and Electronically Stored 
 Information in INMATE DEATH, LHN-CIV-2019-00204 
 The BOP and its employees are required to preserve any potentially relevant 
 information pertaining to 
 EFTA00036429
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 6:30 am, EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 76318-
 054, was found unresponsive in his cell in conjunction with an apparent suicide, 
 and, subsequently, pronounced dead at the local hospital. No lawsuit has been filed 
 yet, but one is anticipated. 
 In this case, relevant information includes, but is not limited to: 
 Please preserve all electronic files (e.g. emails, Word documents, TRUSCOPE 
 entries, videos, BEMR records) and all handwritten or other physical documents 
 pertaining to inmate Epstein. 
 You have been identified as an individual likely to have information relevant to 
 this matter. Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to preserve any such 
 information in your possession, custody, or control even if it otherwise would be 
 destroyed, deleted or overwritten, in the normal course of Agency operations. 
 Knowingly altering, editing, or deleting potentially relevant information could 
 result in court-ordered sanctions against the BOP and/or employment action 
 against staff. 
 Electronically stored information (ESI) includes all information stored in any 
 digital medium, including the BOPA's computer network, any PCs, laptop computers, 
 all back-up media, email, calendars, word processing documents, scanned documents, 
 spreadsheets, photos and drafts. 
 DO NOT DISCARD OR DESTROY ANY RECORDS (ELECTRONICALLY STORED OR OTHERWISE) 
 RELATING TO THIS MATTER. 
 Action Required: 
 1. Complete the attached Custodian Document Search Checklist and return to 
 by 08/21/2019. 
 2. Preserve Relevant Information 
 a. Do not alter, edit, delete, or otherwise destroy potentially relevant 
 information in either paper or digital documents. All auto-deletion 
 functions should be turned off and any retention policy should be 
 suspended if execution would cause the loss of potentially relevant 
 information. Do not move or alter electronic documents as this will 
 modify the metadata. Should you need to work on a relevant document, 
 please save it as a new version and edit the new version. 
 b. Do not transfer any potentially relevant information to a 
 Federal Records Center (FRC) or any other location. 
 c. Notify me of any potentially relevant information that is in the 
 process of being or has been sent to an offsite storage facility 
 (FRC or any other offsite facility). 
 3. Contact me if there are any staffing changes in your office that affect 
 this matter (e.g., retirement, transfer, etc.). 
 4. If you are aware of the loss of any potentially relevant ESI, notify me 
 immediately. 
 5. This document is privileged and confidential. 
 DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE THIS NOTICE WITH ANYONE.

Suicide Prevention for Inmates 
 "If you are going to tolerate a few deaths in your 
 correctional system, then you've already lost the 
 battle." - Commander, Orange County Jail 
 MCC New York 
 Special Housing Unit 
 EFTA00036447
Why Should I Care? 
 Isn't this 
 _ 
 a Psychology Program'? 
 • An inmate suicide represents major 
 liability exposure of the agency and in 
 some cases, staff could be held personally 
 liable for the death. 
 EFTA00036448
Suicide Statistics 
 FY 2012 
 of • Numb• er  Suicides — 29 
 • Number of Attempts — 1,304 
 • Number of Suicide Watches — 2,595 
 • Locations — SHU (9), GP (17), FMC (2), 
 Other (1) 
 Of these 29 suicides 62% had a history of 
 mental illness, 31% had a history of a sex 
 offense and 5% were on p• rotective custody 
 status

 EFTA00036449
Suicide Prevention Program 
 P.S. 5324.08 
 • All Staff need to read and be 
 familiar with this policy. Nobody 
 can say one suicide is no big deal, 
 it can't be helped, but when it 
 happens it puts a microscope on 
 your area and the institution. 
 EFTA00036450
Suicide Prevention Program 
 • No such thing as a bad referral. During day 
 watch refer to Psychology. Non-duty hours 
 to on-call psychologist. Report any inmate 
 that you feel may be suicidal or that you 
 have other mental health concerns about. 
 Make sure your officers are similarly 
 trained to make referrals. If you refer and 
 the inmate dies, that is on psychology. If 
 you don't refer and the inmate dies, that is 
 on correctional services. 
 EFTA00036451
Suicide Prevention Program 
 • All staff are required to attend annual 
 refresher training on suicide prevention 
 during ART. SHU officers are required to 
 have suicide prevention training in SHU 
 quarterly. This is ordinarily done by psych 
 services adding the information to the SHU 
 post orders. The officers meet this policy 
 requirement when they read and sign the 
 post orders. 
 EFTA00036452
Suicide Prevention Program 
 Watches — Call the Operations Lieutenant 
 immediately and notify Psychology staff if 
 concerns are present. Any Shift Lieutenant 
 can put on a watch during emergency or non-
 duty hours. While policy allows any staff to 
 place an inmate on watch, the intent is that 
 this call will generally be reserved for shift 
 LT. Some institutions preference is to sit the 
 inmate down where shift LT can observe until 
 on call psych shows up. Only Psychology can 
 terminate the watch. 
 EFTA00036453
Suicide Prevention Program 
 • If inmate companions are used, staff should 
 provide two checks during an 8 hour shift. 
 Initial log (critical for liability). 
 • Maintain the integrity of the watch. Strip 
 search the inmate going in and out of watch. 
 Search the cell before the inmate is placed 
 in the suicide watch cell. Only those things 
 authorized by Psychology are allowed in the 
 cell — everything else out.

Suicide Prevention Program 
 What's New? 
 • Psychology will provide SHU (copy to 
 Correctional Services, Health Services, and 
 Unit Team) a list of inmates (Hot List) with 
 mental health conditions who may become 
 dangerous, self-destructive, or suicidal 
 when placed in SHU. The list will be 
 updated as needed. 
 • When a `hot list' inmate is placed in SHU, 
 Correctional Services supervisor shall 
 notify Psychology immediately. 
 EFTA00036455
Historically High Risk Groups 
 • Pre-Trial Prisoners 
 • Mentally Ill 
 • Inmates Who Voluntarily PC 
 • Low Security Inmates — Poor 
 Adjustment with Sudden Loss of 
 Relationship 
 EFTA00036456
Suicide Watch 
 • The Warden decides if the watch will be conducted using inmate 
 observers or staff. It is based upon a recommendation by psych and 
 depends on the level of acting out expected by the inmate. 
 • Why constant visual supervision? We use constant observation to 
 prevent an inmate from killing themselves. An inmate committed 
 suicide while on watch at MDC Los Angeles. He drowned himself in 
 his toilet while the inmate observer when back to his cell to use the 
 restroom (10-15 minutes). 
 • Do you think that an inmate can kill themselves under constant 
 observation? Inmate at Seagoville cut a hole in his mattress cover and 
 cut his wrist. He slid his arm inside the cover so the observer could 
 not see the blood. One drop of blood dripped through on to floor, the 
 observer saw it and summoned help. 
 • Why 15 minute log entries? So psych can monitor inmate behavior, 
 sleeping, eating taking meds, etc. 
 EFTA00036457
Challenging Inmates... 
 Tough for Everyone! 
 • Psychology realizes that inmates who try to manipulate the 
 system are really problematic for Correctional Services. 
 • No matter how many times you have reported it in the 
 past... If an inmate makes a statement about suicide, or 
 makes gestures that indicate they are trying to make you 
 think they will commit suicide, go ahead and report it. 
 • The danger with them is that they can unintentionally kill 
 themselves if the officer doesn't walk by or make that 
 round at the expected time. 
 EFTA00036458
What is Your Role? 
 Your Example is critical! 
 • Communicate and work closely 
 with psychology 
 • You set the example — if all staff 
 think suicide prevention is 
 important and they emphasize it 
 with others then all staff will 
 respond

 Thank you fellows. It just took a little push to get the right message out there. Not patronizing, just playing Devil's 
 advocate. Just knew somebody would be a little more articulate explaining where the BOP is going with this. We personally 
 like our NICE system, since 2006, and understand the reason behind Fitara. It just takes a while and patience for people to 
 accept change. It happened with us. 
 >» 8/12/2019 1:02 PM > » 
 OH YEAH. Sorry couldn't resist. Always been a big fan of Mr. Kool Aid. 
 I do like the idea of a national supported system that would standardize the FBOP. It only makes sense. We have Motorola, 
 Medtel and CEIA as universally recognized systems. I think most would agree those three were good choices and we would 
 probably all fight tooth and nail to keep them. I can't say that I'm a fan boy of putting our systems on BOPNet. Everyone 
 being on a different system has been the comm tech's best defense against absorption by IPPA and keeping local authority 
 over IP assignments and network infrastructure. 
 I don't think hiring a contractor to provide third party multi-manufacture support was ever a good idea. Avigilon was 
 purchased by Motorola a while back. They have a good camera selection with a Windows based recording system just 
 like all major CCTV VMS manufactures these days. The problem with standardizing is if the selected system isn't what you 
 cut your teeth on you probably won't like it. Great thing about Avigilon right now is few to none of us have it or have even 
 seen it so everyone would get a new system and be on the same learning curve. 
 If Motorola offered a direct customer support contract to the FBOP for Avigilon on a nation wide bases it would be a good 
 contender for standardization in my book. Also any other system manufacture with direct national support and separate 
 network infrastructure would get my vote also. Every system I've seen was plagued by the same problem and that's a 
 windows OS so what does it really matter?

 Just to add a different point of view on this. There are currently 2 systems approved for BOP use (more specifically for new 
 purchasing). NICE and Avigilon. We got a lot of Avigilon products FITARA approved and added to the approved hardware 
 list a few months ago. 
 As I see it, the main issue is the contract with SIGNET. We have a BOP-wide maintenance contract with them for our 
 DVR/NVR systems. Currently, that contract is set up for NICE, Pelco and Vicon. With only 1 manufacturer on both the 
 approved hardware list and maintenance contract, we're in a bit of a pickle. I do not know when the contract is up for 
 renewal. I can see Avigilon being added to the contract, and Pelco and Vicon remaining with only legacy support. 
 On one hand, it seems the BOP is trying to relatively standardize camera systems nationwide. Along with radios and 
 telephones, cameras are probably the most used system we have that has actual user interface; specifically for transferring 
 staff. Having the same system across the board will benefit a lot of people. Also, having a standardized system also helps 
 with staff assist visits. A tech from Yazoo would know how to work on a system in Marianna. Another consideration is the 
 BOP Command Center and Backup Command Center are both NICE-centric platforms from what I understand. 
 On the other hand, yes, someone in Central Office seems to have gotten the agency to jump head first in to the SIGNET/NICE 
 pool. The main reason that I can think of as to why is the migration to IPv6. NICE was one of the first. Vicon and Pelco were 
 way behind. I am not saying any of this to bolster NICE. I have my reasons for pushing to get Avigilon approved as I feel it is 
 a far superior system. But, with seemingly 75-80% or more of the BOP already on NICE, it does make sense to go ahead and 
 standardize across the board if possible. 
 Personally, I would love to roll out a bunch of Avigilon systems. Like all of you, I have my personal takes on the equipment 
 that I like to work on. I would love to standardize all of the systems we have from coast to coast. That would cut down on 
 training expenses, spare parts packages, improve responses to emergencies and staff assist visits, etc. Unfortunately, there is 
 too much bureaucracy with our purchasing guidelines and required approvals for purchases such as these. 
 I have probably heard as many positive reviews as negative reviews from BOP techs regarding NICE. Personally I went to 
 NICE training a few years ago to check it out and was entirely unimpressed. I am sure that there have been changes to the 
 system since then that would alleviate many of my negative thoughts on the system. 
 I'm certainly not championing or trashing NICE. I just wanted to lay out some other trains of thought as to why things might 
 be going the way they are right now. There are many camera systems out there so very out of date that they are practically 
 useless. It would seem money is finally being made available to rectify that situation. 
 This was just my $.02. I'm not trying to get anyone to drink the Kool Aid. Take it for what it's worth. 
 >> > 8/12/2019 1:09 PM >» 
 Yes, and no. To each their own but I do agree with, "if ain't broke, why fix or replace it?" And If I do need to replace it, how 
 about taking some input from the individual(s) who actually install and maintain the equipment. They just might know a 
 little bit and surprise the people behind Fitara with what they know; the more options the better. Each Institution knows 
 what works for them.

 Here in Victorville ECI 1 we have had Nice since 2006 and it has been amazing. We got an update in 2014 and it has been a 
 really solid system. In 2017 they replaced a Viconet system at the ECI 2 that was in really bad shape. Since their upgrade 
 they have been really happy. I did not have any of these problems you guys are experiencing now. I'm guessing it has to do 
 with the Windows upgrade. Once these issues are ironed out I'm sure you guys will love your new Nice system like we do

 First impressions are critical. If you walk into a Special

 floor, marks and writing on the walls, food trays laying about, 
 it signifies staff just don't care. If this is happening, there is 
 more behind the scenes occurring. This leads to assaults on 
 staff, assaults on inmates, and inmates refusing to comply 
 with orders. Basically, a unit where inmates are in charge.

 One other thing that happened after the new version was installed. The colors on the AMS and 1 workstation (the Captains) 
 are way off. Yellow comes in as Light Blue and Red comes in as Purple. I've tried all the settings on the AMS and the 
 computers themselves. No luck. Jeff McKenzie is also working on this problem with Qognify if anyone else is having a similar 
 issue.

 Restarting the AMS was the first thing I tried. Unfortunately, that did not fix the issue. I spoke to a couple of different comm 
 techs who gave me some guidance on what worked for them. I'm trying some different things now and will update the 
 group if I find a solution. Thanks for everyone's input and help.

 Yep. Same exact issue here in Houston. It happened after we loaded the latest update. Might be a pain, but if you still 
 have a copy of the old AppSuite you could load it just long enough to unlock the work station and then go back to the

 Well be briefing, our new ODAG Liaison. 
 Given the time crunch, both with the briefing scheduled next Tuesday as well as the limited time we'll have with the new 
 liaison (2 hours total), I'd suggest simply reviewing your respective areas and seeing if there are any significant changes 
 needed to your respective briefing areas. If none, simply advise and we'll leave the material alone. If there are needed 
 changes of significance, please let and I know ASAP as we'll have to incorporate into the existing materials. I know 
 HSD and RSD will need to adapt for changes in their respective ADs/Actings; OGC may need to be covered b=I itiMs 
 absence - not sure how you want to work that out. For those who provided the briefing last go-around, it'll even need to be

 Region and/or CO BOP, and if so, were they provided? 
 EFTA00036546
8. Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages? We assume both. 
 Does BOP have a rough breakdown of the usual split between the two? 
 9. Do you track mandatory vs. voluntary OT at MCC NY? If so, pls provide breakout of usage by PP this FY or readily 
 available time period. (Is voluntary OT vs. mandatory OT coded differently in NFC? If so, we can run rpt here). If 
 you need to ask the MCC for a breakout, skip this. 
 10. Does MCC use the traditional BOP "bid sheet" (or whatever the BOP term is) process whereby staff can sign up in 
 advance for OT shifts? If so, do you save? Can you provide YTD data on how much requested OT has been used vs. 
 total OT? 
 Pls answer what you can from Central Office, no intention of addin to work at MCC. Just let me know if you 
 can't answer something because you'd have to ask the MCC. Thk

NICE/Qognify Installation Check list 
 • Need BOP approved IP address and Gateway for AMS (if new) NVR servers, Encoders 
 and Decoders. 
 • Adequate rack space for the NVR'S, at least a 32" deep rack. Rails are provided for new 
 AMS and NVR's. Rack space for the Encoders that will be placed near the existing matrix 
 (if applicable) or throughout other locations in the institution. 
 • AMS needs 1U of rack space, NVR's require 2U, Encoders and Decoders 1U. 
 • Check for adequate power, NVR's have 2 power supplies and need to be on two 
 separate circuits. Encoders only require one power supply. Decoders that are needed to 
 be installed in the Control Center will need to be on UPS power as well as the monitors 
 connected to them. 
 • Validate each of the existing Analog PTZ camera address settings and data protocol, 
 provide that in the current camera list. 
 • Provide a list of users that currently access the camera system. (will validate on site). 
 • Provide a camera grouping list and pages (If applicable). Can be extracted from the 
 current camera matrix. 
 • Coaxial patch cables with BNC connectors may need to be made prior to our arrival to 
 patch from the matrix and/or fiber media converters to Encoders (if applicable). 
 • Will need a BOPNET workstation with local user account to be installed in the Control 
 Center to run the Qognify Application Suite to view and control PTZ Cameras. (This 
 might be required for SIS and the Command Center.) 
 • Qognify Application Suite will be provided and extracted off the AMS server to be 
 installed by Computer Services on BOPNET workstations requiring access to the Camera 
 System. 
 • Provide a PLC camera callup output list for programming and connectivity to the 
 NVE2016 Encoders.

 In
 fo for questions 8-10: 
 After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-10, 2019, 
 the numbers are as follows: 
 8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
 EFTA00036559
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
 8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
 8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
 8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
 8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
 8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
 Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-custody staff. 
 Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to all staff and an all-call 
 via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening and morning 
 shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
 Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

 2. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-Board Correctional Officer numbers for MCC New York? Pls 
 provide Correctional Officer count by PP last three FYs. 
 3. What is regular entry level grade and salary (with locality) of a entry level CO at the MCC? 
 4. Pls provide MCC Inmate count weekly for past 5 years (fiscal or calendar, your choice). Or, if weekly isn't 
 convenient, whatever your standard reporting is will be OK. 3 years OK if you don't have 5 quickly. 
 5. What was the normal staff count supposed to be for Friday 8/9 night shift and overnight shift into Saturday 
 8/10? What was the actual staff count for those two shifts? 
 6. What 3R bonuses are being offered at MCC NY? How many staff have received them the past two FYs? How 
 many current staff have received 3R bonuses? 
 7. This FY or last FY, did MCC New York request additional Correctional Officer positions or total positions from the 
 Region and/or CO BOP, and if so, were they provided? 
 8. Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages? We assume both. 
 Does BOP have a rough breakdown of the usual split between the two? 
 9. Do you track mandatory vs. voluntary OT at MCC NY? If so, pls provide breakout of usage by PP this FY or 
 readily available time period. (Is voluntary OT vs. mandatory OT coded differently in NFC? If so, we can run rpt

 10. Does MCC use the traditional BOP "bid sheet" (or whatever the BOP term is) process whereby staff can sign up 
 in advance for OT shifts? If so, do you save? Can you provide YTD data on how much requested OT has been 
 used vs. total OT? 
 Pls answer what you can from Central Office, no intention of addin to work at MCC. Just let me know if you 
 can't answer something because you'd have to ask the MCC. Thk

 Boss, 
 I think we have a viable plan. I know that you are extremely busy, so If you can let me know when is a good time to talk. 
 Below you will find a brief synopsis. 
 • It is looking like MCC will have some recording by the end of the day today and the rest by the end of day tomorrow. 
 • The new recording system will not be on the BOPNET but will have local recording/viewing capabilities. 
 • In order to get the system on the BOPNET and get the additional digital cameras installed, I am recommending that 
 we bring 6 electricians to finish running conduit and 2 Comm techs TDY to run the fiber. This would be their only 
 mission. I am estimating that if this happens they will work 12 hour days and it should take 4-6 weeks once work 
 begins. 
 So when you have time please let me know and ill give you a call and explain everything that needs to be accomplished. 
 I told the Facility Manager to get with the-and let him know what is going on and maybe you can all talk 
 together also as an option.

 procurement or technical assistance.

 The FBI is going to be retrieving the previous recordings from or camera system at MCC, but because we 
 aving dificulty retrieving the recordings, they have told us the recording capabilities will be off line for up to 8-10 days 
 while they retrieve this data. We will still have live viewing/monitoring. My question: are there options for remote recording 
 from another location, or do we possess other equipment that can be connected to the system while the current recording 
 capabilities are off line?

 a are e c ua u ooze an c ua urrent On-Board employee numbers for MCC New York? Also, can 
 you provide snapshots of MCC auth vs. onboard staff for past three years (quarterly snapshots fine). 
 2. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-Board Correctional Officer numbers for MCC New York? Pls provide 
 Correctional Officer count by PP last three FYs. 
 3. What is regular entry level grade and salary (with locality) of a entry level CO at the MCC? 
 4. Pls provide MCC Inmate count weekly for past 5 years (fiscal or calendar, your choice). Or, if weekly isn't 
 convenient, whatever your standard reporting is will be OK. 3 years OK if you don't have 5 quickly. 
 5. What was the normal staff count supposed to be for Friday 8/9 night shift and overnight shift into Saturday 8/10? 
 What was the actual staff count for those two shifts? 
 6. What 3R bonuses are being offered at MCC NY? How many staff have received them the past two FYs? How many 
 current staff have received 3R bonuses? 
 7. This FY or last FY, did MCC New York request additional Correctional Officer positions or total positions from the 
 Region and/or CO BOP, and if so, were they provided? 
 8. Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages? We assume both. 
 Does BOP have a rough breakdown of the usual split between the two? 
 9. Do you track mandatory vs. voluntary OT at MCC NY? If so, pls provide breakout of usage by PP this FY or readily 
 available time period. (Is voluntary OT vs. mandatory OT coded differently in NFC? If so, we can run rpt here). If 
 you need to ask the MCC for a breakout, skip this. 
 10. Does MCC use the traditional BOP "bid sheet" (or whatever the BOP term is) process whereby staff can sign up in 
 advance for OT shifts? If so, do you save? Can you provide YTD data on how much requested OT has been used vs. 
 total OT? 
 Pls answer what you can from Central Office, no intention of addin g to work at MCC. Just let me know if you 
 can't answer something because you'd have to ask the MCC. Thk.

 I attached 2 copies of Epstein SRO reviews: 
 1. Epstein_Reno76318-054_SRO_20190710-20190723.pdf (confined in SHU 7/10/2019 - 7/23/2019), and 
 2. Epstein_Reno76318-054_SRO_20190729-20190810.pdf (confined in SHU 7/29/2019 - 8/10/2019) 
 Because the first confinement, Epstein was held only 2 days in SHU (7/7/2019 - 7/8/2019), NYM did not review Epstein. 
 Thanks,

 I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to 
 reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through 
 Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-mail me the results when you are done. This is a

 following up on the below info, a lot of media are speculating that he should not have been removed from SW. While 
 of course the length of time someone is there is not a determining factor, and the information below explains what SW is like 
 and why it is generally used for just short periods, I pulled some info on the average time inmates are on SW. This info 
 covers the past year: 
 3,893 Suicide Watches were conducted (for 2,175 unique inmates) 
 11,267 Total Days of Suicide Watch 
 Average Length of Suicide Watch: 2.89 Days/Watch (which includes a number of longer watches where inmates were waiting 
 for a hospital bed) 
 Median Length: 1.5 Days 
 I think this provides a more complete picture on how SW is used and why it is not usually used for long periods.

 - Below is the explanation as provided by our Psychology Services Administrator. They will be providing the 
 research behind this tomorrow, but wanted to get this information to you tonight. Let me know if you have any 
 questions regarding this information. 
 Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly 
 restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a suicide 
 watch include containment in an identified suicide watch cell absent tie-off points and sharp objects, placement in 
 a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant observation by another individual, lights on 24 
 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on personal property for safety, and at least daily 
 contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions are extremely effective in the short-term 
 prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future oriented goals and the 
 achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal crisis, but is ended when 
 an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to resume goal directed 
 behaviors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or 
 attorneys, work, etc. The assessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted by 
 a doctoral level psychologist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with ongoing 
 assessment and interventions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or supportive 
 visits.

 ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they 
 will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called 
 and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time

 (OAG) 
 - Below is the explanation as provided by our Psychology Services Administrator. They will be providing 
 the research behind this tomorrow, but wanted to get this information to you tonight. Let me know if you have 
 any questions regarding this information. 
 Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly 
 restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a 
 suicide watch include containment in an identified suicide watch cell absent tie-off points and sharp 
 objects, placement in a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant observation by another 
 individual, lights on 24 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on personal property for 
 safety, and at least daily contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions are extremely 
 effective in the short-term prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future 
 oriented goals and the achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal 
 crisis, but is ended when an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to 
 resume goal directed behaviors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or 
 attorneys, work, etc. The assessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted 
 by a doctoral level psychologist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with 
 ongoing assessment and interventions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or 
 supportive visits.

 IPPA AD made an edit to his offenses & then DOJ had us say investigated by FBI (even though FBI told us 
 in the past not to say that). DOJ is talking with FBI now to confirm this latest version...so this is NOT final yet, but MAY end 
 up being the approved version attached. probably send to all media that emailed me (over 50 emails) and then I'm

 I like the concept but would remove certain portions that suggest we failed or you are responsible. While it 
 appears at least 2 or 3 people failed, saying WE failed speaks to the 36K that did their jobs right. I do think we 
 should get something out that reinforces our appreciation for the good work most are doing.

 Below is a a message to staff. I debate in my mind whether to send a message or not, but I am very 
 concerned for our staff, and how we are all being criticized. I also think everyone needs a reminder to not let 
 their guard down and do all aspects of their jobs. Thus, I think it is important to get a message such a this out. 
 Each of you either have a role in this situation, or are overseeing other institutions, and I greatly value your 
 opinions. I would like each of you to review this and provide me any feedback by the end of the weekend. If we 
 do post a message, I will want to do that Monday morning. Feel free to call me tomorrow if you prefer. Thank 
 you.

Draft: 
 As all of you have heard by now, one of our high profile inmates was found dead this weekend of an apparent 
 suicide. The media and others are questioning how this could happen and some are jumping to conclusions. A 
 number of investigations are being conducted to find out exactly what happened. The FBI and Inspector General 
 are already onsite doing their work. We will follow up with a suicide reconstruction and after action review. 
 These investigations need to be allowed to come to their own conclusions. It is premature and inappropriate to 
 be placing blame or speculating as to what may have happened or why. Appropriate steps will be taken once all 
 the facts have been flushed out through these investigations. We have clear policies and procedures. If the 
 investigations determine they were not followed then appropriate steps will be taken. Likewise, if it is 
 determined that our policies and procedures are insufficient, then we will take immediate steps to improve those 
 as well. Let me be clear, it is our job to safely confine all inmates in our custody. We failed to do that job. 
 Period. However, we should not be speculating as to who did or did not do something. Ultimately, I am 
 responsible for what happens in our facilities, and at this point in time, no-one should be blamed for this failure 
 other than me. Instead of blaming or speculating, we all need to use this event as a reminder that every aspect of 
 our jobs are important. Everyone needs to be on alert all day and night when on the job. Everyone needs to 
 remember that people's lives are at stake, and our actions or inactions can have dire consequences. 
 The work we do is difficult on the best of days. The scrutiny we are all under right now, will only add stress and 
 make our jobs more difficult. Please be sure we all watch each others backs and help everyone do their jobs, and 
 most importantly, that everyone remains safe and goes home at the end of each shift. I remain in awe of the great 
 work you do every day, and you have, and will always have, my support and appreciation.

 Thanks. Just FYI, we do have a limited number of SAMS in other USPs. We hold them there pending their ADX hearings. 
 Not all USPs, but a select few. I routinely had one at McCreary.

 They do house SAM inmates there. SAM are Special Administrative Measures. 
 See: 
 https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-24000-requests-special-confinement-conditions 
 Only the AG can put a SAM on an inmate and this results in significantly limiting an inmates communication. We have SAM 
 inmates in 10 South and at the ADX (rd have to check to see if we house anywhere else, but I don't think so). There are very 
 few inmates subject to SAM as this is very limiting, and generally are due to national security cases. 
 Have a good day off (I hope it's a day off). We can talk at your convenience. Thx.

 If they give us the date range we can make a notation of that fact. My question would be, were they there to be an addition 
 to the number of available staff or did they have a special purpose? If they were basically additional officers, then the overti 
 me use will show that even with additional people they keep having shortages. But it will show relief was provided by the ag 
 ency to head off potential overtime fatigue by regular MCC staff. Sent from my Verizon, Samsun Galax smartphone<!--

 Great report. Appreciate the help. Quick question; page 15 breaks down the OT occurrences over a period of time. During 
 a 30 day portion of that time we had approximately 15 Officers from other locations TDY to MCC NYM, and much of that OT

was provided by those staff. Would it help if we provided that information to show there were additional staff available and t 
 he OT was not performed by the current Corr Svc compliment?

 Jeffrey Epstein Reg. No. 76318-054. The duration of this visit will

 laptops for use during this review. 
 As mentioned, ensure your staff are available and responsive. Also,

 After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-
 10, 2019, the numbers are as follows: 
 8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
 8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
 8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated)

 8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
 8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
 8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
 Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-
 custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
 all staff and an all-
 call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
 and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
 Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

 Jo for questions 8-10: 
 After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-
 10, 2019, the numbers are as follows: 
 8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
 8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
 8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
 8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
 8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
 8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
 8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
 Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-
 custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
 EFTA00036626
all staff and an all-
 call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
 and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
 Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

 I. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual Current On-
 Board employee numbers for MCC New York? Also, can you provide snapshots of MCC auth vs. onboard staff 
 for past three years (quarterly snapshots fine). 
 2. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-
 Board Correctional Officer numbers for MCC New York? Pls provide Correctional Officer count by PP last thre 
 e FYs. 
 3. What is regular entry level grade and salary (with locality) of a entry level CO at the MCC? 
 4. Pls provide MCC Inmate count weekly for past 5 years (fiscal or calendar, your choice). Or, if weekly isn't 
 convenient, whatever your standard reporting is will be OK. 3 years OK if you don't have 5 quickly. 
 5. What was the normal staff count supposed to be for Friday 8/9 night shift and overnight shift into Saturday 
 8/10? What was the actual staff count for those two shifts? 
 6. What 3R bonuses are being offered at MCC NY? How many staff have received them the past two FYs? 
 How many current staff have received 3R bonuses? 
 7. This FY or last FY, did MCC New York request additional Correctional Officer positions or total positions f 
 rom the Region and/or CO BOP, and if so, were they provided? 
 8. Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages? We assume b 
 oth. Does BOP have a rough breakdown of the usual split between the two? 
 9. Do you track mandatory vs. voluntary OT at MCC NY? If so, pls provide breakout of usage by PP this FY 
 or readily available time period. (Is voluntary OT vs. mandatory OT coded differently in NFC? If so, we can ru 
 n rpt here). If you need to ask the MCC for a breakout, skip this. 
 10. Does MCC use the traditional BOP "bid sheet" (or whatever the BOP term is) process whereby staff can sig 
 n up in advance for OT shifts? If so, do you save? Can you provide YTD data on how much requested OT has b 
 een used vs. total OT? 
 Pls answer what you can from Central Office, no intention of adding to work at MCC. Just let me know if you c 
 an't answer something because you'd have to ask the MCC. Thks=

 Boss, 
 I think we have a viable plan. I know that you are extremely busy, so If you can let me know when is a good time to talk. 
 Below you will find a brief synopsis. 
 • It is looking like MCC will have some recording by the end of the day today and the rest by the end of day tomorrow. 
 • The new recording system will not be on the BOPNET but will have local recording/viewing capabilities. 
 • In order to get the system on the BOPNET and get the additional digital cameras installed, I am recommending that 
 we bring 6 electricians to finish running conduit and 2 Comm techs TDY to run the fiber. This would be their only 
 mission. I am estimating that if this happens they will work 12 hour days and it should take 4-6 weeks once work 
 begins. 
 So when you have time please let me know and ill give you a call and explain everything that needs to be accomplished. 
 I told the Facility Manager to get with the-and let him know what is going on and maybe you can all talk 
 together also as an option. 
 > » /13/2019 8:13 AM >>> » 
 Thank et me know their recording capabilities later today and if we need to get Central Office involved in 
 procurement or technical assistance.

 Recently, if you watch the news, you will see some things happening around our agency that does not 
 highlight the great work we do each and every day. I just want to remind you that the work you do is 
 important and valued by everyone. Even those who often times don't understand what that work is or 
 they do NOT walk in the shoes we walk in daily. 
 This message is to remind everyone of the policies and protocols we put in place in order to keep 
 people safe! Example; 30 minute irregular rounds, walking and talking, detailed counts, close attention 
 to detail, and being positive, responsive, and proactive while working in a correctional environment. 
 Our message as an Executive Team to everyone is we "Do the Right Thing,  at the Right Time,  for the 
 Right Reasons"! We ensure this by being caring human beings, charged with a very important task for 
 the responsibility, safety of staff, inmates, and the community. This is an awesome challenge and each 
 and every one of you should be proud and honored to take on. 
 Be cognizant of the message you put out in the community as we are all representatives of this agency. 
 The only person designated to speak with the media is our designated Public Information Officer. 
 Thank you for what you do! At McKean

term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving 
 the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a suicide watch include containment in an identified suici 
 de watch cell absent tie-
 off points and sharp objects, placement in a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant obs 
 ervation by another individual, lights on 24 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on pers 
 onal property for safety, and at least daily contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions ar 
 e extremely effective in the short-
 term prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future oriented goals and the 
 achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal crisis, but is ended when 
 an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to resume goal directed behav 
 iors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or attorneys, work, etc. The a 
 ssessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted by a doctoral level psycholog 
 ist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with ongoing assessment and intervent 
 ions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or supportive visits.

 Warden, 
 Per our conversation, I spoke to two of his attorneys yesterday, August 9, 2019, primarily in relation to his request for access 
 to water in attorney conference. Attorney Mariel Colon, with whom I spoke in person in the late morning, had asked as an 
 aside whether we would consider housing him in the Cadre. I advised we could not since he was a pretrial inmate. Later that 
 day but prior to the 1:00 close-out meeting, I spoke to Attorney Michael Miller on the phone. He had asked whether we 
 could house Mr. Epstein alone in SHU, to which I replied that we could not based on his prior suicide attempt/gesture. He 
 acknowledged that he understood. To my recollection, neither attorney referenced consideration for suicide watch or 
 psychological observation during yesterday's conversations. 
 Please let me know if you need any further information. 
 Thank you,

Suicide Watch and Psychology Observation 
 Suicide Watch 
 Inmates are determined to be suicidal. They are placed in a suicide watch smock and provided a suicide 
 watch blanket and suicide watch slippers. They are given a paper spoon. Inmates are watched by inmate 
 companions or staff 24 hours a day. They are seen by psychology staff at least once a day. Legal visits 
 are determined on an individual basis. 
 Psychology Observation 
 Inmates are determined not suicidal or at imminent risk of suicide. They may be stepped down from 
 suicide watch, be exhibiting psychotic symptoms, or exhibit mental health concerns. Inmates are watched 
 by inmate companions or staff 24 hours a day. They are seen by psychology staff at least once a day. 
 The inmates are provided with spoons to eat. They are allowed to remain in the inmate uniforms. Other 
 privileges are given as approved (toothbrush, books, paper and pen, legal pen).

 Hi Rogi 
 Please see the following paragraph as a justification for why every individual with some level of suicide risk is n 
 of maintained on long-term suicide watch: 
 Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-
 term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving 
 the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a suicide watch include containment in an identified suici 
 de watch cell absent tie-
 off points and sharp objects, placement in a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant obs 
 ervation by another individual, lights on 24 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on pers 
 onal property for safety, and at least daily contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions ar 
 e extremely effective in the short-
 term prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future oriented goals and the 
 achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal crisis, but is ended when 
 an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to resume goal directed behav 
 iors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or attorneys, work, etc. The a 
 ssessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted by a doctoral level psycholog 
 ist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with ongoing assessment and intervent 
 ions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or supportive visits.

 I like the concept but would remove certain portions that suggest we failed or you are responsible. While it 
 appears at least 2 or 3 people failed, saying WE failed speaks to the 36K that did their jobs right. I do think we 
 should get something out that reinforces our appreciation for the good work most are doing.

 Below is a draft message to staff. I debate in my mind whether to send a message or not, but I am very 
 concerned for our staff, and how we are all being criticized. I also think everyone needs a reminder to not let 
 their guard down and do all aspects of their jobs. Thus, I think it is important to get a message such a this out. 
 Each of you either have a role in this situation, or are overseeing other institutions, and I greatly value your 
 opinions. I would like each of you to review this and provide me any feedback by the end of the weekend. If we 
 do post a message, I will want to do that Monday morning. Feel free to call me tomorrow if you prefer. Thank 
 you. 
 Draft: 
 As all of you have heard by now, one of our high profile inmates was found dead this weekend of an apparent 
 suicide. The media and others are questioning how this could happen and some are jumping to conclusions. A 
 number of investigations are being conducted to find out exactly what happened. The FBI and Inspector General 
 are already onsite doing their work. We will follow up with a suicide reconstruction and after action review. 
 These investigations need to be allowed to come to their own conclusions. It is premature and inappropriate to 
 be placing blame or speculating as to what may have happened or why. Appropriate steps will be taken once all 
 the facts have been flushed out through these investigations. We have clear policies and procedures. If the 
 investigations determine they were not followed then appropriate steps will be taken. Likewise, if it is 
 determined that our policies and procedures are insufficient, then we will take immediate steps to improve those 
 as well. Let me be clear, it is our job to safely confine all inmates in our custody. We failed to do that job. 
 Period. However, we should not be speculating as to who did or did not do something. Ultimately, I am 
 responsible for what happens in our facilities, and at this point in time, no-one should be blamed for this failure 
 other than me. Instead of blaming or speculating, we all need to use this event as a reminder that every aspect of 
 our jobs are important. Everyone needs to be on alert all day and night when on the job. Everyone needs to 
 remember that people's lives are at stake, and our actions or inactions can have dire consequences. 
 EFTA00036690
The work we do is difficult on the best of days. The scrutiny we are all under right now, will only add stress and 
 make our jobs more difficult. Please be sure we all watch each others backs and help everyone do their jobs, and 
 most importantly, that everyone remains safe and goes home at the end of each shift. I remain in awe of the great 
 work you do every day, and you have, and will always have, my support and appreciation.

 Subject Fwd: Re: How did the tour go? 
 Date: Fri, 16 Aug 2019 12:42:31 +0000 
 Importance: Normal 
 Thanks, I thought possible, but didn't want to commit...I have only signed SAM memos for ADX and MCC 
 » /16/20198:41 AM »> » 
 Than s. ust , we do have a limited number of SAMS in other USPs. We hold them there pending their ADX hearings. 
 Not all USPs, but a select few. I routinely had one at McCreary.

 They o ouse inmates t ere. are Special Administrative Measures. 
 See: 
 https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-24000-requests-special-confinement-conditions 
 Only the AG can put a SAM on an inmate and this results in significantly limiting an inmate's communication. We have SAM 
 inmates in 10 South and at the ADX (I'd have to check to see if we house anywhere else, but I don't think so). There are very 
 few inmates subject to SAM as this is very limiting, and generally are due to national security cases. 
 Have a good day off (I hope it's a day off). We can talk at your convenience. Thx.

 custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
 all staff and an all-
 call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
 and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized.

 Subject: Program Summary Report - FY 2019, 3rd Quarter 
 The attached Program Summary Report contains cumulative findings from program reviews 
 conducted the 3rd quarter of FY 2019 (April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019). The information

ISSUES AND IDEAS 
 Program Review Branch: 
 Review Team Participation: Examiners continue to face difficulties staffing program review 
 teams. Participation on program reviews provides valuable experience and training. All 
 CEOs are encouraged to support their staff's involvement as participants on program review 
 teams. 
 Operational Review & Working Papers: Untimely and incomplete operational reviews remain 
 an issue across all disciplines. The operational review is an important local evaluation process 
 that enables staff to closely evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a program and take 
 corrective action. By using this process effectively, weaknesses can be identified and 
 corrected quickly through strategic planning. Action plans can be developed to ensure 
 correction over time and the strengthening of the program. In addition, the operational 
 review process enables program managers to establish strong internal controls to ensure 
 corrective action continues to be effective. P1210.23 Management Control and Program 
 Review Manual, Chapter 3, provides guidance on the operational review process. Sites are 
 strongly encouraged to review this information to ensure policy compliance. Additionally, the 
 Program Review Division is available to provide training in person (requester expense), or via 
 VTC training for field, regional, and central office staff. This training outlines many segments 
 of P1210.23, and outlines the review process and quality control. 
 Working papers provide a systematic record of the work done by a reviewer or team. They 
 contain the information and evidence necessary to support the findings and recommendations 
 presented in the operational review report. 
 The operational review working papers are to be placed in a file that would facilitate their use 
 and prevent loss or mutilation. The department head, or administrator of the program 
 reviewed, must retain the working papers for subsequent operational reviews, as well as the 
 report, until the next scheduled program review has been conducted and a final report issued. 
 During the next program review, the reviewers are to examine working papers from the 
 operational review(s) to determine that the review was comprehensive and the adequacy of 
 controls were assessed. 
 EFTA00036707
PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Ten Affirmative Employment Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two superior and eight acceptable. Two repeat 
 deficiencies and twenty deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Vacant SEPM and ROPC positions were not advertised within 30 calendar days. 
 • Newly selected SEPMs, alternate SEPMs, and ROPCs have not met training 
 requirements. 
 • Not all AEP Meeting minutes document the review of the DVAAP, FEORP, and MD-715 
 reports. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Vacant SEPM/ROPC positions are not announced within 30 days of becoming vacant. The 
 chairperson should forward a copy of the employee's resignation memorandum/E-mail to the 
 HR office in order for the collateral duty position to be advertised again. Collateral duty 
 positions should continue to be re-advertised until they are filled. HR and the AEP 
 chairperson should work closely together to ensure positions are advertised timely. 
 Newly selected SEPMs, alternate SEPMs, and ROPCs are not meeting training requirements. 
 Newly selected committee members have 6 months to complete training as outlined on the 
 Affirmative Employment Sallyport page at http://sallyport.bop.gov/co/prd/aa/index.isp. Staff 
 who have served on AEP Committees previously will be given credit for training received, as 
 long as it is documented in their training record. It is recommended that AEP chairpersons 
 conduct yearly AEP retreats and cover any new items during the retreat. A sign-in sheet 
 should be utilized, and provided to HR to key into the employees training record. 
 One of the purposes of the AEP Meeting is to review the progress being made towards the 
 initiatives outlined in each of the following reports: FEORP, DVAAP, and MD-715, on at least a 
 quarterly basis. The chairperson can pick one month each quarter (i.e., first month of each 
 new quarter) to review the reports (review the goals, accomplishments made, and what the 
 focus is for the next quarter), and ensure it is documented in the meeting minutes, as required 
 by policy. It is important to refrain from cutting and pasting the same information from one 
 month to another. 
 EFTA00036708
When responding to the program review report, include both components (Human Resource 
 Management and Affirmative Employment Program), and ensure all subsequent 
 communication relative to the review is provided in one response, not separate responses. 
 All correspondence regarding the program review/operational reviews needs to be sent to

 EFTA00036709
PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019, 3rd QUARTER 
 CORRECTIONAL PROGRAMS 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Eleven Correctional Programs Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six good, four acceptable, and one deficient. Five 
 repeat deficiencies and seventy-four deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • RPP CMA assignments are not always accurate 
 • State and local law enforcement officials are not always notified of inmates releasing to 
 a term of supervision. 
 • Sex offender inmates are not always notified of the requirement to register. 
 • Required unit staff do not always work a late night. 
 • Unit managers do not always work a weekend/holiday each month. 
 • Unit staff do not always conduct daily SHU rounds. 
 • Locator Center staff do not always have the proper SENTRY verb access. 
 • Authorities holding detainers are not always notified of impending releases as required. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Management should provide additional oversight with regard to RPP CMA assignments. 
 Additionally, implementation of the Release Orientation Program (ROP) should not negate the 
 "RPP Part" CMA assignment, or the relevance of previously completed traditional RPP courses. 
 Offenders convicted of certain sexual offenses, drug trafficking crimes, or crimes of violence 
 require notification to designated law enforcement and sex offender registration officials. 
 Notifications should be mailed 2 weeks prior to the inmates' release to a term of supervision to 
 ensure the notifications are received at least 5 days prior to the inmates' release date. Also, 
 inmates convicted of certain sexual offenses should be notified that they may be required to 
 register upon release from custody. Documentation of compliance should be maintained in 
 the inmate central file. 
 Management should provide additional oversight, and monitor unit staff schedules, to ensure 
 staff are working the required schedules as dictated by policy. Specifically, unit managers, 
 case managers, and correctional counselors must work a late night each week. Also, unit 
 managers are required to work a weekend/holiday each month. Out of eleven reviews 
 conducted this rating period, this area was identified as a deficiency during seven reviews. 
 The unit team, specifically, unit managers, case managers, and correctional counselors, are 
 required to conduct daily SHU rounds, to include weekends and holidays. The unit team is 
 considered all of the previously stated positions under the direction of one unit manager. For 
 3 
 EFTA00036710
the purposes of program review, staff may not substitute or sign for another unit team. 
 SHU rounds are not required if there are no inmates assigned to the unit housed in SHU. 
 However, documentation should be maintained demonstrating this is the case. 
 All staff assigned to the Control Center, on all shifts, and the Correctional Systems Department, 
 should have the WITSEC SENTRY verb access when assigned to these posts. Control Center 
 staff access, to this SENTRY verb, should be provided and removed based on the quarterly 
 rotation. The CIM coordinator should ensure the staff access list maintained by IMS is 
 consistent with the local CSM list of staff. 
 Authorities holding detainers on inmates in BOP custody should be notified of the inmates' 
 impending release at least 90 in advance. Detainer Action Letters sent, on possible pending 
 charges/sentences for newly arriving inmates, may not be substituted for the release 
 notification.

 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Inmates in SHU are not observed each 30 minute period, on an irregular schedule, with 
 rounds being no more than 40 minutes apart. 
 • Special Housing Unit Record, BP-A292.052, forms are not completed to document all 
 required information. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 At three institutions during this review period, inmates assigned to SHU were not being 
 observed in accordance with policy. It is the responsibility of staff to conduct these rounds 
 ensuring the welfare of each inmate, and to document the rounds. Inmates in continuous 
 lockdown must be observed each 30 minute period, on an irregular schedule, and no longer 
 than 40 minutes apart. It is essential that management ensures rounds are being conducted 
 and documented according to policy. A lieutenant must visit SHU during each shift to ensure 
 all procedures are followed. 
 It was noted, at three institutions during this review period, that Special Housing Unit Records, 
 BP -A292.052, are not properly completed to document that inmates are receiving 5 hours of 
 recreation, medical visits, OIC assignments, showers, and meals. A lieutenant must visit SHU 
 during each shift to ensure all procedures are followed.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 EDUCATION/RECREATION SERVICES 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Thirteen Education Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior, six good, and three acceptable. One 
 repeat deficiency and twenty-eight deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Literacy progress assignments, and 240-hour progress reviews, are not monitored and 
 documented appropriately. 
 • Instructional staff do not spend a minimum of 50 percent of their work hours in direct 
 class instruction. 
 • Operational reviews are not conducted and documented appropriately. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 In accordance with VCCLEA/PLRA and policy requirements, all inmates enrolled in the literacy 
 program must be reviewed for satisfactory progress every 240 hours of instruction, with the 
 progress results documented on the PERW screen in SENTRY. Also, education progress 
 assignments must be monitored and documented appropriately. In addition to meeting the 
 element of the law, this documentation of inmate progress in literacy is also a behavioral 
 management tool. Review findings this quarter showed evidence that this tool is often not 
 appropriately utilized, and VCCLEA/PLRA literacy requirements are not always documented and 
 followed. 
 To ensure instructional systems are effective, it is imperative that instructional staff are present 
 and engaged in the learning process. Staff shortages, ineffective scheduling, mismanagement 
 of staff resources, and over usage of inmate tutors have been evidenced during reviews 
 conducted this quarter. Managers are encouraged to reevaluate scheduling and staffing to 
 ensure all staff assigned to literacy classes, to include GED, ESL, and SLN, are actively engaged in 
 their respective classes. 
 Operational reviews provide management with an annual opportunity to reexamine program 
 areas that have been identified as crucial to program success through the management 
 assessment process. Review findings suggest that greater emphasis is needed during 
 operational reviews to ensure the accuracy of review findings, timeliness of reporting, and 
 adequate modification of internal controls to prevent reoccurrence.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Twelve Environmental and Safety Compliance Program Reviews were 
 conducted from 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six superior, five good, and one 
 acceptable. Four repeat deficiencies and sixteen deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Not all Institution Safety Committee requirements are being met. 
 • CA-7 forms were not always submitted timely to the respective Office of Workers' 
 Compensation District Office. 
 • OSHA recordkeeping requirements were not always being met. OSHA 300 logs were 
 not always accurately maintained, and did not always include all inmate recordable 
 injuries. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Institution Safety Committee Meetings must be conducted quarterly. Additionally, they must 
 cover all required topics and meeting minutes must be appropriately disseminated in 
 accordance with policy. 
 In compliance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), institutions must 
 effectively manage Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP) requirements, including 
 the timely submission of CA forms to the respective OWCP District Office. Regulations require 
 the employer to complete and transmit the agency portion of the CA-7 form within 5 working 
 days of agency receipt. 
 OSHA 300 logs and OSHA form 301 are not always accurately maintained. These logs are 
 important for spotting injury trends, and are often requested during OSHA compliance site 
 visits. In addition, OSHA issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2017, and phased in over 2 
 years, which revised OSHA's regulations on "Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and 
 Illnesses" (29 CFR 1904). The rule requires employers to begin submitting injury and illness 
 data to OSHA electronically, via a secure website. While the rule has been suspended, OSHA 
 has the prerogative of implementing various rules which makes recordkeeping accuracy critical. 
 Establishments, with 250 or more employees, were required to maintain information from all 
 OSHA recordkeeping forms (300A, 300, and 301). Accurate recording and reporting of 
 work -related injuries is therefore essential.

 FACILITIES MANAGEMENT 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Eleven Facilities Management Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of three superior, three good, four acceptable, and one 
 deficient. One repeat deficiency and thirty-four deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Fire inspections are not being conducted per NFPA. 
 • Refrigerant quantities reported in CMMS do not match what is entered in the 
 technician's log. 
 • Operational reviews were not timely or incomplete. 
 REVIEWER'S COMMENTS: 
 As per P4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual, fire system inspections and testing shall be 
 conducted and documented in accordance with NFPA 25, NFPA 72 (latest edition), and 
 applicable policies. 
 As per P4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual, daily refrigerant records must be maintained, 
 within a bound log book or electronic database, by the certified technician (HVAC, Garage, 
 Utility Systems Repairer-Operator, etc.). To enable proper reporting of Ozone Depleting 
 Substances (ODS) to the U.S. Department of Energy, the facility manager or designee must 
 enter refrigerant records into CMMS quarterly. 
 As per P1210.23, Management Control and Program Review Manual, each program at all 
 organizational levels should conduct an operational review between 10-14 months from the 
 week of the previous program review (including those programs receiving a deficient rating). 
 An additional operational review should be conducted 22-26 months from the week of the 
 previous program review for those programs that receive good or superior ratings. The 
 review authority will direct that a follow-up be conducted to measure the effectiveness of the 
 corrective action. The follow-up review will be conducted 120-150 calendar days after the last 
 day of the operational review. It will be under the associate warden's supervision (institution 
 reviews), and focus on areas of concern and deficiencies.

 FEMALE OFFENDERS 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Two Female Offender Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of one superior and one good. One deficiency was 
 identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Reviews conducted this quarter showed evidence of gender-responsive program opportunities 
 being provided, and programming needs being appropriately considered, in accordance with 
 the institution's mission. Staff ensure appropriate documentation, designation, and 
 monitoring is completed for expectant inmates. Gender specific services are provided as 
 necessary to female offenders, to include commissary items, personal hygiene items, and other 
 needs that are unique to the female population.

 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Ten Financial Management Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of eight superior and two good. Three deficiencies 
 were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 The accountability of property is a growing concern. Although there are procurement and 
 property positions vacant throughout the Bureau of Prisons, the requirement for conducting 
 inventories remains policy driven. All efforts should be made to complete all required 
 inventories timely. 
 Operational reviews continue to be a concern. Operational reviews must be completed using 
 the correct guidelines, the working papers must be signed and dated, and all identified areas of 
 concern documented in the report. In addition, responses, follow-up reports, and closures are 
 required for operational reviews. P1210.23 Management Control and Program Review 
 Manual, provides procedures and time frames for completing operational reviews.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 FOOD SERVICE 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Eighteen Food Service Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two superior, eight good, seven acceptable, and one 
 deficient. Seven repeat deficiencies and sixty-seven deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Machine guarding is not always in place during operation to prevent injury to staff and 
 inmates. 
 • Potentially hazardous food is not always protected from possible overhead 
 cross -contamination. 
 • Temperature logs are not always maintained according to policy. 
 • Potentially hazardous foods are not always maintained according to policy. 
 • Hand washing sinks are not always utilized or maintained in accordance with policy. 
 • Access panels, leading to energized circuits and gas components, are not always secured 
 with locks or security screws to prevent unauthorized access. 
 • Walk-in refrigerators and freezers do not have a device that allows the door to be 
 opened from the inside, even if locked from the outside. 
 • Wiping cloths are not always stored in a chemical sanitizer according to policy. 
 • Budget projections are not always accurate, and do not include all foods needed to 
 support the National Menu. 
 • Operational reviews are not always complete and/or timely. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Inspection of equipment revealed machine guards are not always in place and/or functional on 
 machinery. Daily monitoring of equipment is needed to ensure guards, for all machines that 
 require them, are properly in place and functional prior to the use of the equipment. This will 
 greatly reduce the possibility of injuries to staff and inmates. 
 Food items stored, prepared, or served below an unsanitized area greatly increases the 
 probability rate of cross-contamination. Food items must be protected from all possibilities of 
 contamination from an overhead source. Detailed sanitation practices are imperative to assist 
 in preventing the possibility of contamination. Evidence of condensation, ice, dripping water, 
 food debris, dust, dirt, mildew, and chipping paint are to be reported immediately to the 
 FSA/AFSA, the Facilities Department must be notified to make repairs, if necessary, and/or a 
 detail cleaning performed to remove possible contaminants from all sources. 
 11 
 EFTA00036718
A review of temperature logs revealed that temperatures are not always recorded and/or 
 annotated according to policy. Temperature logs are often missing the required temperature 
 readings, and in some cases, the logs are not present. Additionally, corrective action and/or 
 justification for temperatures recorded outside the acceptable ranges are not listed on the 
 temperature logs. Additional training should be provided to increase staff awareness of the 
 importance of proper temperature monitoring and annotation of the temperature logs. 
 Observations this quarter identified the need for closer oversight in the handling of potentially 
 hazardous food items. Potentially hazardous foods (hot and cold) were found being stored, 
 prepared, and served outside the acceptable temperature ranges. Additional training should 
 be provided to increase staff awareness of the proper techniques of monitoring food 
 temperatures to prevent the potential for food borne illness. Consistent temperature checks, 
 in food storage, production, holding, and serving, will reduce the potential for problems in this 
 vital function area. 
 Hand washing sinks, and/or hand washing stations, were not always utilized or maintained in 
 accordance with policy. Utility and food preparation sinks were observed being utilized for 
 hand washing. Hand washing stations were lacking warm water, soap, and/or the means to 
 dry hands. Not all hand washing stations were equipped with a sign instructing food handlers 
 to wash their hands upon reporting for duty, or after the use of restroom facilities. Regular 
 monitoring of all hand washing sinks/stations is recommended to ensure policy is being 
 adhered to. 
 Inspection of equipment and physical plant revealed access panels leading to energized circuits 
 and mechanical components continues to be an issue. Observations during this review period 
 revealed that access panels are not properly secured with locks or security screws. Daily 
 monitoring of equipment is needed to ensure all equipment is properly secured, and there is no 
 evidence of tampering with security features. Building a cooperative relationship, and 
 maintaining open lines of communication between Food Service and the Facilities Department, 
 is paramount to a functional and safely operated Food Service Department. 
 Wet wiping cloths were observed not being stored according to policy. Wet cloths, used for 
 clean contact or non-contact food surfaces, are to be stored in a chemical sanitizer at a 
 concentration specified by the manufacturer. Wet cloths used for raw animal foods must be 
 kept in a separate sanitizing solution. Wet wiping cloths not in use were observed being 
 stored improperly. Additional training should be provided to increase staff and inmate 
 awareness of the importance of properly storing wet wiping cloths to minimize the risk of 
 cross -contamination. 
 Issues are still occurring in the budget process. Oversight and additional training is needed to 
 ensure budgets are accurate and include all items needed to support the approved menus. 
 Closer attention should be paid to ensure the information in FNS is accurate and updated to 
 12 
 EFTA00036719
correctly reflect the needs of the department. This includes recipes being accurate, and the 
 acceptability of menu items being in close proximity to the actual usage and updated as 
 needed. 
 Operational reviews were frequently found not being timely and/or complete. The timeliness 
 of operational reviews was not always in accordance with P1210.23, Management Control and 
 Program Review Manual. Operational reviews were found to be missing working papers 
 and/or memorandums. Staff conducting operational reviews should become familiar with all 
 aspects of P1210.23. 
 Throughout this rating period, there continues to be numerous repeat deficiencies and 
 deficiencies attached to ACA mandatory standards, and deficiencies that are considered vital 
 functions. To ensure there are no concerns during upcoming ACA reaccreditations, and 
 continued deficiencies with vital functions, food service management must place more 
 emphasis on, and monitoring of, all ACA mandatory standards to ensure compliance. 
 As a reminder, all items listed in Attachment B of the Program Review Notification are to be 
 present in the work area of the review team when they arrive at the facility to conduct the 
 review. This is imperative to ensure that adequate time is available to complete working 
 papers and stay on schedule to complete the review in the 3 day time frame.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 HEALTH SERVICES 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Eighteen Health Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior, seven good, four acceptable, and three 
 deficient. One significant finding, six repeat deficiencies, and seventy-three deficiencies were 
 identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Physical, dental, and female examinations for new commitments were not always 
 completed as required by policy. 
 • Inmates enrolled in chronic care clinics were not always evaluated timely, and/or had 
 clinically indicated treatment completed as ordered. 
 • Inmates with HIV infection were not always managed according to guidelines. 
 • Inmates with latent TB infection (LTBI) did not receive chest radiographs timely, and/or 
 offered treatment appropriately. 
 • Emergency disaster drills were not conducted as required, and did not always have 
 appropriate critique and/or corrective actions. 
 • Medication Administration Records (MARS) were not always completed after 
 administering narcotic medications. 
 • Licensed Independent Practitioner (LIP) privileges were not always granted and 
 approved in accordance with policy, and/or licenses were not verified timely. 
 • Ancillary staff licenses were not always verified timely. 
 • Practice agreements were not always completed properly. 
 • Peer reviews for LIPs were not completed in accordance with policy. 
 • T&A files were not always accurate. 
 • Operational reviews were not always completed according to policy. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Reviews conducted this quarter revealed three deficient reviews due to a lack of administrative 
 and clinical oversight, as well as a breakdown in compliance with ACA mandatory standards. 
 There was one significant finding noted as well. During the significant finding review, it was 
 found that the Health Services Department is not maintaining strict and accurate monitoring 
 and tracking of inmates with significant medical conditions. Failure to evaluate, examine, and 
 provide ongoing medical needs and treatment presents the potential for rapid deterioration of 
 the health of inmates. This review could negatively impact the institution's ability to regain 
 ACA reaccreditation. Non-compliance with ACA mandatory standards continues to have a 
 huge impact on program review ratings and ACA accreditation. 
 14 
 EFTA00036721
Physical and dental examinations for new commitments must be conducted within the required 
 time frame. It is essential to complete the examination timely to determine an inmate's 
 medical needs. Failure to identify inmate health issues can cause deterioration of patient 
 health and possible legal consequences. 
 Inmates enrolled in chronic care clinics must be evaluated every 12 months, or more often if 
 clinically indicated. Clinically ordered testing must be completed as ordered to ensure chronic 
 illnesses are monitored closely to prevent further disease progression. 
 Clinical management of inmates with HIV infection is essential in controlling the disease 
 process. Proper immunizations and timely evaluations help prevent further disease 
 progression and appropriate management of laboratory testing results. 
 Timely chest radiographs, on inmates with latent TB infection (LTBI), helps prevent spreadable 
 infections throughout the inmate population. Clinical review of each case, with appropriate 
 treatment offered, prevents future outbreaks from latent infections. 
 Emergency disaster drills need to be completed twice per year. Appropriate drills help test 
 the resources available of each health services department, and ensures proper supplies and 
 responses to emergencies are accurate and effective. Critique and corrective actions will help 
 identify weaknesses which can be corrected prior to actual emergencies. 
 MARs were not always completed after administering narcotic medications. Accountability is 
 very important for DEA controlled medications, therefore, administering of medications must 
 be documented in the MARs after it is dispensed. 
 Credential files must be maintained appropriately. LIPs must have accurate privileges and all 
 licenses verified timely. Practice agreements must be complete and institution specific. 
 Mid -level practitioners and dental hygienists must have a practice agreement with a licensed 
 physician/ dentist prior to providing any health care in the institution. Peer reviews should 
 address all required elements and have corrective actions addressed appropriately. Continual 
 training to field staff, and frequent review of credentialing policy requirements, as well as 
 monitoring of internal local tracking mechanisms, is paramount in reducing the number of 
 recurrent deficiencies. Failure to maintain accurate credential files imposes risks for both ACA 
 and Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) reaccreditation. 
 Proper management of T&A files continues to be an issue throughout the institutions. Eight 
 deficiencies were identified due to inaccurate maintenance of T&A files. Proper 
 documentation of leave, overtime, and corrected T&A's need to be maintained to prevent 
 waste, fraud, and abuse. 
 A large number of reviews were conducted this quarter, and there were many deficiencies and 
 repeat deficiencies identified. Operational reviews were a finding on three occasions. Solid 
 operational reviews can be used as a tool to monitor the deficiencies which were identified.

 EFTA00036722
PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Ten Human Resource Management Program Reviews were conducted 
 from 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of one superior, five good, and four acceptable. 
 Two repeat deficiencies and thirty-four deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • T&As were not accurate. 
 • Not all mandatory payroll reports were run each pay period. 
 • Mandatory training standards were not in compliance. 
 • Not all staff received female offender training. 
 • Not all staff completed firearms training timely, and approved waivers and supporting 
 documentation was not on file for the entire lapse period, nor did they contain 
 projected completion dates. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 T&A records were not accurate. Timekeepers/keyers are responsible for accurately recording 
 and keying time and attendance data for the employees assigned to them to ensure accuracy of 
 entitlements/pay. Timekeeper/keyers are responsible for ensuring each T&A is certified as 
 accurate by the supervisor prior to transmitting to the National Finance Center. Annual 
 refresher training must be provided by HR to ensure policy compliance. 
 Documentation must be maintained to verify which mandatory payroll reports were run each 
 pay period. HR must ensure that mandatory payroll reports are run each pay period, and have 
 a clear audit trail reflecting corrective action when warranted. 
 Mandatory training is not being completed within the required time frame. There are reports 
 in BLU that will assist HR offices in ensuring mandatory training is completed prior its 
 expiration. HR needs to notify managers, and/or supervisors, before staff certifications are 
 due to expire. Executive staff should also be kept abreast in order to support HR in their 
 effort to ensure mandatory training compliance is met. 
 HR managers are responsible for ensuring all new staff, and staff transferring to institutions 
 housing female offenders, complete the training developed by the Women and Special 
 Populations Branch and the trauma-informed correctional care module. P5200.02 Female 
 Offender Manual, states in relevant part: "All staff at institutions or complexes housing 
 female offenders are required to complete training developed by the Female Offender Branch 
 and the trauma-informed correctional care module." In addition, the Bureau Mandatory 
 Training Standards require the training be completed within 60 days of entry on duty to a 
 facility housing female inmates. 
 16 
 EFTA00036723
Approved waivers, and supporting documentation, was not on file for the entire lapse period 
 for staff unable to maintain firearms certification. Annual firearms certification is an ACA 
 mandatory requirement, therefore, it is imperative, when staff are unable to certify annually, 
 there is a signed waiver (by the CEO), and supporting documentation, on file to justify the lapse 
 period (i.e., military leave, extended sick leave, OWCP). If the employee is unable to complete 
 the certification by the projected due date, HR must ensure another waiver, which is supported 
 by updated documentation, is routed to the CEO for signature. A waiver must be on file for 
 the entire firearms certification lapse period. 
 When responding to the program review report, include both components (Human Resource 
 Management and Affirmative Employment Program), and ensure all subsequent 
 communication relative to the review is provided in one response, not separate responses. 
 All correspondence regarding the program review/operational reviews needs to be sent to

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SECURITY 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Eleven Information Systems and Security Program Reviews were 
 conducted from 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two superior, seven good, one 
 acceptable, and one deficient. Twenty-one deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Critical and sensitive systems have not been identified in the current contingency plan. 
 • Staff are not aware of the proper procedures for protecting sensitive information. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Critical and sensitive systems have not been identified in the current contingency plan. Staff 
 must ensure critical and sensitive systems are properly documented in the current contingency 
 plans. The guidance provided at national IT training, quarterly video conferences, and most 
 recently by your regional computer services administrators, should be followed. There were 
 four deficiencies identified for this step this quarter, and one deficiency identified last quarter. 
 P1237.16, Information Security provides guidance on critical and sensitive systems. 
 Sensitive information is not labeled. Staff are not aware of, or adhering to, local and national 
 information security procedures. End users must be trained in the protection of sensitive 
 information. There were five deficiencies identified for this step this quarter, and one 
 deficiency identified last quarter. P1237.16, Information Security, provides guidance on 
 sensitive materials. 
 Although not a frequent deficiency, additional oversight is needed to ensure required annual 
 recertifications are completed by the due date provided by the Office of Information Systems. 
 There were two deficiencies identified for this step this quarter. P1237.14 Personal 
 Computers and Network Standards, provides guidance on annual recertifications, and OIS 
 Technical Bulletins outline the due date and method of submission. 
 Additionally, operational reviews not being timely and complete is another recurring finding. 
 In order to ensure operational reviews are complete, the correct guidelines must be used, all 
 working papers must be completed (this includes the standard program review steps), working 
 papers must be signed and dated, and all identified issues must be documented on the report. 
 The entire process includes completion of the follow-up review/report and obtaining closure. 
 There were two deficiencies identified for this step this quarter. P1210.23 Management 
 Control and Program Review Manual, provides guidance on the operational review process. 
 The program review team also provided guidance on this subject at annual training in Denver in 
 August 2018.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Eighteen Psychology Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six superior, five good, and seven acceptable. Three 
 repeat deficiencies and eighty-four deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Suicide watch log books are not always utilized, in accordance with the post orders, to 
 document constant observation of suicidal inmates. 
 • Suicide Risk Assessments are not always conducted and documented in PDS-BEMR 
 within 24 hours of the referral. 
 • Identified high risk inmates are not always screened by a psychologist within 24 hours of 
 SHU placement. 
 • Sexual Abuse Interventions are not always documented in PDS-BEMR within 24 hours. 
 • Inmates coded as CARE2-MH do not always have a rationale for their diagnosis and care 
 level documented in PDS-BEMR. 
 • Inmates prescribed antipsychotic medication do not always have the rationale for 
 frequency and type of care documented in PDS-BEMR. 
 • Inmates participating in follow-up drug treatment do not always have timely progress 
 reviews documented in PDS-BEMR. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Suicide watch log books are not always utilized, in accordance with the post orders, to 
 document constant observation of suicidal inmates. Post orders need to be adhered to when 
 staff are watching suicidal inmates. Staff are typically required to sign suicide log books every 
 15 minutes to document the constant observation of suicidal inmates. Coordination between 
 Psychology Services and Correctional Services staff is required when conducting suicide 
 watches. 
 Suicide Risk Assessments are not always conducted and documented in PDS-BEMR within 24 
 hours of the referral. Suicide Risk Assessments need to be documented in the PDS record or 
 review queue within 24 hours of the referral. Please be mindful, policy discusses it being 24 
 hours from the referral and not 24 hours from the time the Suicide Risk Assessment was 
 completed. 
 Identified high risk inmates are not always screened by a psychologist within 24 hours of SHU 
 placement. Any inmates coded as CARE3-MH, CARE4-MH, PSY ALERT, and/or who are on the 
 Psychology Advisory List, need to have a restrictive housing mental health screening within 24 
 19 
 EFTA00036726
hours of placement in SHU. Please be mindful, the policy time frame is 24 hours and not one 
 working day. 
 Sexual Abuse Interventions are not always documented timely. Sexual Abuse Interventions, 
 for victims of sexually abusive behavior, need to be documented in PDS-BEMR within 24 hours 
 of the contact. 
 Inmates coded as CARE2-MH do not always have a rationale for their diagnosis and care level 
 documented in PDS-BEMR. Inmates coded as CARE2-MH need to have a rationale for the 
 diagnosis and assigned mental health care level documented in a Diagnostic and Care Level 
 Formulation. Additionally, inmates who are prescribed antipsychotic medication need to have 
 the rationale for frequency and type of care documented in PDS-BEMR. Current and thorough 
 documentation assists in guiding the treatment process, and with continuity of care if inmates 
 transfer to different institutions or are released. 
 Inmates participating in follow-up drug treatment do not always have timely progress reviews 
 documented in PDS-BEMR. Inmates who have completed the residential component of the 
 RDAP, and are participating in follow-up services, need to have timely progress notes 
 completed and documented in PDS-BEMR.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 RELIGIOUS SERVICES 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Ten Religious Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of five superior, three good, and two acceptable. 
 One repeat deficiency and ten deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Chaplains should be mindful of the special needs populations [i.e., female inmates, and inmates 
 in Special Management Units (SMUs), Communication Management Units (CMUs), and Mental 
 Health Units (MI-Ills)]. Also, care should be given in providing spiritual resources to inmates 
 housed in SHU. 
 All incoming chapel media, whether purchased or donated, should be previewed and logged 
 into the "Standardized Chapel Library Catalog" (SCLC) prior to distribution to the inmate 
 population, per the Second Chance Act of 2007. Several chapels have developed a log sheet, 
 of all incoming media items that are currently under review, comprised of the title and date of 
 purchase (or donation), which has proven to extremely beneficial.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 RESIDENTIAL REENTRY 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Four Residential Reentry Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two acceptable and two deficient. One repeat 
 significant finding, one repeat repeat deficiency, two repeat deficiencies, and thirteen 
 deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • Operational reviews were not conducted within the required time frames, and were not 
 complete. 
 • Escape reports were not always completed on all escapes (actual or technical). 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 There was one repeat significant finding identified this quarter in contracting. Proper 
 oversight of contracts is not being accomplished. Basic contract administration tasks, to 
 include staff clearances, tracking of contract actions, and proper contract monitoring 
 procedures, are not being followed. This causes a lack of credible accountability of the 
 contract and assurance to the public, while increasing liability to the agency. 
 Operational reviews are often not completed according to policy. Staff should monitor 
 operational review and follow-up date requirements to ensure they are in compliance with 
 policy. Staff should ensure each guideline step is completed for an effective, policy compliant 
 operational review. RRO staff are reminded that operational reviews must be closed prior to 
 their next program review. P1210.23, Management Control and Program Review Manual 
 provides guidance on the operational review process. 
 Oversight needs to be strengthened to ensure all contracting documentation (e.g., monitoring 
 reports, IGAs, CEFs, and contractor training) is reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and policy 
 requirements, as well as ensuring it is in accordance with BOP guidelines and in the best 
 interest of the agency. Failure to do so causes a lack of credible accountability of the contract 
 and assurance to the public, while increasing liability to the agency. 
 Victim/Witness notifications were not always submitted immediately upon an inmate being 
 placed on escapes status. RRO staff failing to notify victims/witnesses of escapes could have 
 life threatening consequences.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 TRUST FUND 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Ten Trust Fund Program Reviews were conducted from 4/1/19 -
 6/30/19, with overall ratings of nine superior and one good. One deficiency was identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Although not a frequent deficiency, inmate performance pay continues to be a concern. 
 Procedures should be put in place to ensure inmate pay is posted, reconciled, and transmitted, 
 via IPAC to the Deposit Fund, Trust Fund Branch, no later than the 15th of the month. Refer to 
 P4500.12 Trust Fund/Deposit Fund Manual Chapter 9, Para 9.10, and Chapter 11, for further 
 guidance. 
 Operational reviews continue to be a concern. Operational reviews must be completed using 
 the correct guidelines, the working papers must be signed and dated, and all identified areas of 
 concern documented in the report. In addition, responses, follow-up reports, and closures are 
 required for operational reviews. P1210.23 Management Control and Program Review 
 Manual, provides procedures and time frames for completing operational reviews.

 EFTA00036730
PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 UNICOR 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Four UNICOR Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior. One deficiency was identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • There were no frequent deficiencies identified this quarter. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Work measurement files need to be maintained for all products manufactured within the 
 factory, and for all processes within factory operations. The set-up and run times in the work 
 measurement file should reflect accurate data and match the times on the current Item 
 Standard Routings. 
 The current policy on production scheduling requires production schedule stability (PSS) of 85 
 percent or better. This rate is determined by the number of jobs with no changes x 100, then 
 divided by the number of released jobs for the period being reviewed. Although there are a 
 variety of reasons or justifications why a job would start late or finish late, factory managers are 
 reminded to document the reason or justification in the job header text within SAP. 
 Staff should ensure that operational reviews are conducted based on the week of the last 
 program review (10-14 months and 22-26 months afterwards). Current PRGs and operational 
 review working papers are available on Sallyport. Staff are reminded, when conducting an 
 operational review, all components, with the exception of the climate, must be completed. 
 If a step does not apply to the site, then N/A can be used on the working paper and that step 
 should be retained with the working papers. 
 The program review process continues to be policy driven, and regardless of the overall 
 performance, the operation must still adhere to all policies, procedures, and laws. Staff are 
 encouraged to stay abreast of program statements and other directives for program 
 compliance. Use of the program review guidelines as the only means of program compliance 
 is inadequate, as the guidelines were developed for periodic program examination, and only 
 cover small parts of various processes and procedures.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
 VOLUNTEER SERVICES 
 NUMBER OF REVIEWS: Ten Volunteer Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
 4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior, two good, and four acceptable. 
 Fourteen deficiencies were identified. 
 MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
 • There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
 Reentry Affairs Coordinators (RACs) should retain the old Volunteer Checklist (BP-A0578), along 
 with the new checklist, in section one of the Official Volunteer File (OVF). This will ensure the 
 approving official's signature is on file certifying the 4-hour training and packet completion. 
 RACs are to enter "end dates" for all Level 2 inactive volunteers in the National Automated 
 Volunteer System (NAVS). Inactive OVFs should be maintained for 3 years from the end date 
 of service, inclusive of the expired volunteer badges. 
 The Volunteer Services Institution Supplement does not need to be approved annually by the 
 regional reentry affairs coordinator. This is only necessary when the supplement is updated. 
 As a reminder, RACs are to use and maintain the official forms, as noted in Attachment A, 
 P5300.22, Volunteer Services. Maintaining the appropriate volunteer documentation is the 
 responsibility of the RAC.

 Good Morning All: 
 Following yesterdays incident, we are all under a microscope. The event is unfortunate and will have a lot of backlash 
 associated with it but I want to say THANK YOU to each and every one of you for doing the job that you do. 
 People don't understand how hard you all work and how you put your life at risk every day. Don't allow all of the criticism to 
 define who we are as people and employees because you all keep this building afloat in the most daunting times 
 and situations. 
 Below are a number of items to remember to protect yourselves: 
 1. As an employee, you can not speak to the media. Refrain from any remarks or statements. That is the duty of the Public 
 Information Officer, at 
 2. We have a lot of visitors in the institution. Have your credentials on you at all times. Additionally, if you're unsure of a 
 person's identity, you can request identification. 
 EFTA00036752
3. Maintain integrity in all forms of communication. Be honest, don't lie. It's the experience that dishonesty is disciplined 
 more severely than the actual offense. 
 4. There will be a lot of requests for memorandums. As a bargaining employee, you have a right to route your memorandum 
 through your Union prior to submitting it to the agency or it's representative, if YOU reasonably believe it can lead to 
 discipline. 
 4. If called for questioning by ANY representative of the agency (BOP, CA, OIG); you are entitled to a representative as a 
 witness or subject if YOU reasonably believe it can lead to discipline. 
 5. The agency and or it's representative are REQUIRED by law to advise you of your right to have representative prior to 
 conducting any questioning. If they don't, please keep the Union informed. While they must inform you YOU have the 
 responsibility of invoking your Weingarten Rights and informing that you want a representative. By law, upon that 
 invockation, all questioning is to cease. 
 6. It is not a condition of employment to speak with O1G. If you find yourself in a room with OIG, you request a representative 
 immediately!! Once you make communication with the Union, further guidance will be given. Investigations/ examinations 
 should not take place at your residence or away from your duty location. 
 7. If you find yourself in a room being questioned by the FBI. Immediately inform that you want an attorney. 
 IN UNITY!!!

 I don't know why they decided to provide fake and non-factual information about me, but hey, if it takes the heat off of my 
 boss, I will take it any day. I know what the truth is and therefore, they can say whatever they want. They think they can 
 get a response from me, they are sadly mistaken. I have been in this business a long time and could have retired years ago 
 and I am going when I want to go. Lol!

 needs to be working. (All cells are currently in use so he can not be moved to another cell.) He will need to be moved by the

 I have a travel related question, 
 If a staff member is assigned as an escort staff and this trip is over the 50 mile radius and goes over 12 hours all together. Is 
 he/she entitled to per diem "75%" on travel days?

 Good Afternoon, 
 As your supervising Associate Warden, it is my goal to have a one on one with each of you and provide you with my 
 expectations. Due to the current situation, I am unable to do this at this time. However, I do want to pass a few things on to 
 you until we can have a sit down discussion: 
 (1). Please ensure you have accountability for your staff because when you are not here and something happens, I am the 
 next in the chain of command to have to respond. If you are out, please ensure that you have an Acting and that Acting 
 knows that he/she is/will be given the same courtesies as you. 
 (2). Timely submission. Please ensure that you submit paperwork in a timely manner. Meaning that if you are late, please 
 don't email it to me and expect me to print, proof, route, etc.... This is not professional and not my job. Submit your T&A in 
 WEBTA timely. 
 (3). Provide me with your leave requests for the entire remainder of the year. Please ensure that those previous and current 
 requests are entered in WEBTA. I would hope that you would have a discussion with me prior to submitting them in WEBTA. 
 (4). If you are late or call in sick, please do not leave me a voice mail message or text. Please contact me on my BOP cell 
 phone at Once you arrive at work, please submit your leave in WEBTA. 
 (5). Comp Time must be pre-approved by me. No exceptions. Once worked, a Comp Sheet must be completed and routed 
 in a folder for my review and then I will forward it on to the Warden. 
 There are additional expectations forthcoming and will be discussed in person during our meeting. You will have your 
 opportunity to discuss any concerns you may have at that time as well. Thanks.

 fake and non-factual information about me, but hey, if it takes the heat off of my boss, I will take it any day. I know what the

 The Council of Prison Locals is advising all subjects and witnesses associated with this incident to remember, Art 6, section 
 f(1) "If an employee reasonably believe discipline may result (2) he/she should exercise their right to requesting a 
 representative. All staff are reminded Art. 6, section h, which protects them from answering any further questions until a 
 representative is made available. I also, advise staff to read Art. 7, section e (2). Understand, the FBI will also be investigating 
 this event. This doesn't applies to the FBI. So, if they desire to speak with any subject (s) or witnessed of an investigation 
 stemming from this, I would strongly advise those staff seek or request assistance of counsel (Attorney).

 1. Do fully vaccinated visitors need to show proof of vaccination?

 Hi 
 We'd like someone to sign an affidavit for now, but we'd also like to identify someone who could testify at trial if 
 need be. The trial is for Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to start in New York in November. 
 I've attached a proposed declaration, though if FedEx has its own standard format, that will likely work too. 
 Thanks,

 Good morning, 
 I have reviewed the records and they seem to be our records. Are you needing someone to sign an affidavit or 
 appear in person at trial? (is this "the" Jeffrey Epstein?)

 Hi 
 I hope you had a nice weekend, and thanks again for the call last week. I've attached the FedEx records for which 
 we are looking for a records custodian. According to a log, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
 Florida sent FedEx a subpoena in February 2008, and the FedEx point of contact was If we find any 
 front matter, like an internal tracking number, we'll let you know. 
 Thanks again for your assistance with this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

 Got a call back from Theresa's office manager. She requested all contact go through her. Her phone number is 
 and her email is . She advised me that Theresa will not be able 
 to make it today as she is in the hospital with her father. She also requested a subpoena be sent requesting her 
 testimony.

suspected, that could in any way impair, limit, or diminish any 
 of the Granted Rights, or which, if sustained, would be a

 in connection with the production or preparation of any 
 Production intended for broadcasting to accept or pay any 
 money or provide any service or other valuable consideration 
 for the inclusion of any matter as a part of any such Production 
 without disclosing the same to the employer of the person to 
 whom such payment is made or to the person for whom such 
 Production is being produced, and that it is Company's policy 
 not to permit any employee to accept or pay any such 
 consideration. Author has not paid or accepted, shall not pay or 
 accept, and has no knowledge of the payment or acceptance of 
 any money, service, or other valuable consideration for the 
 inclusion of any plug, reference, product identification, or any 
 other matter in the Property and/or Productions and further

 EFTA00037027
respect to Section 508 of the Federal Communications Act, as

 warranties of Author set forth in the Agreement are true and 
 correct and will be true and correct as of completion of all of 
 Author's services in connection with the Productions as 
 contemplated herein. 
 25. Indemnification Author agrees to indemnify, and hold harmless Company, its 
 successors, licensees and assigns, and the officers, parents, 
 affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, representatives, and 
 employees of each of the foregoing, and any other person(s) or 
 entity(ies), in whole or in part, owning, financing, producing, or 
 otherwise exploiting the Productions and/or any other motion 
 picture or other work based on the Property, and each of them, 
 from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, 
 costs, expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable outside 
 attorneys and reasonable outside accountants' fees and court 
 costs, whether or not in connection with litigation) and judgments 
 (collectively "Claims") brought or incurred by third parties arising 
 out of Author's breach of this Agreement. 
 26. Confidentiality Author shall not individually, or through any publicity 
 representative or otherwise, circulate, publish or otherwise 
 disseminate any news story, article, book or other publicity 
 relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, Company, the 
 Productions or the Granted Rights to Company in connection with 
 the Productions, unless first approved in writing by Company. 
 Author shall not acquire any right under this Agreement to use, 
 and shall not use or permit the use of, the name or any fanciful 
 characters or designs, logos or trademarks of Company or that of 
 its successors or assigns, or of any telecaster or other exhibitor of 
 the Productions, or the parent, subsidiary or affiliated entities of 
 each of the foregoing. Author also shall not disclose to any third 
 party any information to which either of them has had or will have 
 access concerning any of the Productions and/or any of 
 Company's, or its related companies, operations or programming 
 or other services or the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
 except as expressly permitted by Company in writing, or as 
 required by law or the valid order of a court of competent 
 jurisdiction, in which event Author shall so notify Company and 
 shall seek confidential treatment of such information (if available). 
 Without limiting the foregoing, Author shall not (nor shall Author 
 authorize others to) disclose to any party any information obtained 
 or learned as a result of any of their involvement with the 
 Productions, including without limitation any information 
 concerning or relating to the Productions, the performers, 
 participants, the events contained in the Productions, the outcome 
 of the Productions or any of the other narrative details of the 
 Productions, unless and solely to the extent such information 
 becomes available to the public through no breach (whether direct 
 or indirect) of this paragraph by Author. The foregoing shall not be 
 deemed to prohibit Author from: (a) providing the financial terms 
 14 
 WIYIYISIc.X.0.000c.4151.notOrl vettrissw 0,0m evittrekvI 
 EFTA00037028
of this Agreement solely for "quote purposes to other third 
 parties who wish to engage Author (unless any such financial terms 
 are expressly referred to herein as "non-precedentie or "non-
 quotable); and (b) issuing personal publicity which includes 
 incidental references to the Productions and Author's involvement 
 therein, provided the same occurs after the initial press release for 
 the Productions has been issued by Company and does not 
 mention the Productions, Company or any other person or entity 
 involved therewith in an unfavorable or derogatory manner. For 
 the avoidance of doubt, Authors confidentiality obligations and 
 publicity restrictions hereunder shall apply to any and all media 
 whatsoever, including, without limitation, any social networking 
 site; micro-blogging service; user-generated or user-uploaded 
 content website; online forum, discussion thread or comment 
 section; personal website or blog; user modified website ("wiki"); 
 and any other website, service, platform, program, application or

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the 
 contrary, Company will not be obligated to: exercise the Option or 
 any extensions thereof; develop, produce, release, broadcast, 
 distribute, or otherwise exploit any audio-visual or podcast under 
 this Agreement or continue any such development, production, 
 release, broadcast, distribution, or exploitation, if commenced; sell 
 any or all of the rights granted herein to any Company or otherwise 
 exercise any of the rights granted to Company under this 
 Agreement. If any of the rights granted to Company herein are sold 
 to a third party, Company shall have no obligation to ensure that 
 any such third party exercises the Option or any extensions 
 thereof; develops, produces, releases, broadcasts, distributes, or 
 otherwise exploits any audio-visual or podcast under this 
 Agreement or continues any such development, production, 
 release, broadcast, distribution, or exploitation, if commenced. 
 Other than as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Company 
 shall not be obligated to make any so-called residual, rerun, foreign 
 use, or theatrical use payments with respect to any motion picture 
 produced pursuant to the rights granted to Company herein. The 
 compensation payable to Author herein is an all-inclusive flat fee 
 and shall constitute full and sufficient consideration for any and all

purposes, including, without limitation, all replays, broadcasts in 
 any foreign area, theatrical exhibitions and exhibitions in any 
 supplemental market. 
 29. No Partnership/Joint 
 Venture 
 Nothing herein contained will constitute a partnership between, or 
 joint venture of, the parties to this Agreement or establish either 
 party as the agent of the other. No Party hereto will hold itself out 
 contrary to the terms of this section, and no Party will become 
 liable for the representation, warranty, act, or omission of any 
 other contrary to the provisions hereof. 
 30. Remedies a) Author's Remedies / No Injunctive Relief:Author acknowledges 
 that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement by Company 
 or any third party, the damage, if any, caused to Author thereby 
 will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle Author 
 to seek injunctive or other equitable relief. Author 
 acknowledges that its rights and remedies in any such event will 
 be strictly limited to the right, if any, to recover damages in an 
 action at law, and Author shall not have the right to terminate 
 this Agreement or any of Company's rights hereunder, neither 
 the right to enjoin the distribution, publication, or other use of 
 the Granted Rights or the exercise of any right in and/or to the 
 Productions, nor the right to enjoin the production, exhibition 
 or other exploitation of any motion picture produced pursuant 
 to the Granted Rights, any element thereof, any subsidiary or 
 allied rights with respect thereto, or any other results and 
 proceeds of Authors services hereunder, nor will Author have 
 the right to terminate their respective services or obligations 
 hereunder by reason of such breach. Without limiting the 
 foregoing or Company's other rights under this Agreement or 
 at law or in equity, under no circumstances will any act or 
 omission of Company which would otherwise constitute a 
 breach or alleged breach of this Agreement be deemed such 
 unless Author notify Company in writing setting forth in detail 
 the basis for such breach or alleged breach and Company fails 
 to commence reasonable efforts to cure such breach or alleged 
 breach within thirty (30) days of Company's receipt of such 
 notice. 
 b) Company Remedies: The rights and services which are the 
 subject matter of this Agreement are of a special, unique, 
 extraordinary and intellectual character which gives them a 
 peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or 
 adequately compensated in damages in an action at law and 
 which would cause Company great irreparable injury and 
 damage. Accordingly, Company shall be entitled to seek 
 injunctive relief, to preserve its rights and interest in and to such 
 rights and services. This provision shall not, however, be 
 construed as a waiver of any rights Company may have for 
 damages or otherwise arising from any breach of this 
 Agreement. At all times, Company shall have all rights and 
 remedies which it has at law or in equity pursuant hereto or 
 otherwise, all of which rights and remedies shall be construed 
 as cumulative.

31. Copyright a) Protection of Copyright 
 L Author shall ensure that the Property will be protected by 
 copyright and will be registered in the United States 
 Copyright Office in Washington, D.C. for copyright 
 protection, following initial publication in the United States. 
 In connection therewith, Author agrees and acknowledges 
 that (1/ the Property is a work of authorship protected under 
 Title 17 of the United States Code and is intended to 
 constitute, and does constitute, intellectual property' 
 within the meaning of sections 101(52)( E) and 365(n) of Title 
 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), and 
 (2) the rights of Company hereunder are "rights to 
 intellectual property" within the meaning of such sections. 
 ii. Author shall take all reasonable steps at Authors expense to 
 protect all copyrights pertaining to the Property from 
 infringement, and Author agrees that it will institute such 
 action and proceedings as may be reasonable to prevent any 
 unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation 
 by third parties of the Property or any part thereof which 
 may be in contravention of the rights granted to Company 
 hereunder. Company shall provide Author copies of all 
 documents executed pursuant hereto. 
 iii. If Author elect not to take any action in the event of an 
 infringement of copyright or of the Granted Rights, Author 
 shall so notify Company promptly, in writing, and Company 
 shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take such 
 action as Company shall deem reasonable in the 
 circumstances, at Authors sole cost and expense. Author 
 appoints Company as its attorney-in-fact (which power is 
 coupled with an interest) to act in its name for the purpose 
 of permitting Company to prevent any unauthorized use, 
 reproduction, exhibition or exploitation of the Property or 
 any part thereof. 
 iv. Author further agrees that it shall not take any steps to 
 prevent, challenge or otherwise hinder Company from 
 registering any and all of Company's interest in the 
 Productions with the United States Copyright Office in 
 accordance with this Agreement. 
 b) Copyright Termination 
 i. If at any time after Company's exercise of the Option, Author 
 or any party succeeding to Authors termination interest or 
 otherwise claiming through Author or any other party so 
 empowered by law is deemed to have any right to terminate 
 any or all of the rights granted to Company hereunder (the 
 "subject rights") pursuant to Section 203 or 304 of Title 17 
 of the U.S. Code (the "Copyright Act") or any other laws of 
 the United States, or any of its subdivisions, or of any foreign 
 country, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to 
 preclude Author from freely exercising said right to 
 terminate. Any exercise or further grant of the subject rights 
 17 
 WIYIYISIc.X.0.000c.4151motOrl vettrissw w,". evnevekvIeco 
 EFTA00037031
so terminated shall be subject to the terms and conditions 
 of this paragraph. Any such right to terminate the subject 
 rights shall in no event apply to any rights granted to 
 Company hereunder other than those rights arising under 
 the Copyright Act or any comparable act of a foreign 
 country. If the parties do not reach an agreement with 
 respect to a reacquisition of the subject rights prior to the 
 effective date of such termination, Company shall have a 
 right of first negotiation and last refusal with respect to the 
 subject rights as follows: If at any time, Author proposes to 
 accept or make a bona fide offer to produce, license, 
 transfer or exploit ("Exploit") any of the subject rights, 
 Author shall first offer to negotiate to grant such rights to 
 Company by giving Company written notice of the rights 
 which Author desires to Exploit and the terms and 
 conditions of any proposed transaction. Within ten (10) days 
 after the receipt of such notice, Company may notify Author 
 whether or not Company desires to negotiate, failing which 
 Company shall be deemed to have elected not to negotiate. 
 If Company notifies Author within such ten (10) day period 
 that it elects to negotiate, then the parties shall negotiate in 
 good faith regarding the subject rights for a period of thirty 
 days thereafter. If Company agrees to negotiate, but such 
 negotiations do not result in an agreement between the 
 parties within such thirty (30) day period, then Author 
 thereafter may negotiate with any third party with respect 
 to the subject rights; provided, that Company may meet any 
 bona fide third party offer which Author are willing to accept 
 (or which is proposed by Author to any third party) ("Third 
 Party Offer"). Author shall give Company written notice of 
 the Third Party Offer, specifying its particulars, including, but 
 not limited to, the identity of the offeror or offeree, the price 
 and other terms, and Company shall have the exclusive right 
 for ten days after its receipt of such notice to acquire the 
 subject rights upon the terms and conditions in Author's 
 notice; provided, that Company shall not be required to 
 meet any term of condition of the proposed transaction 
 which may not be as easily met by Company as by any other 
 party. If Company exercises its right within such ten (10) day 
 period, then Company shall be deemed to have acquired the 
 subject rights and Author shall execute and deliver such 
 additional documentation as Company may reasonably 
 request to further evidence such acquisition. If Company 
 fails to exercise its rights, Author may make or accept the 
 Third Party Offer; provided, that if the transaction 
 contemplated by such Third Party Offer is not consummated 
 upon the terms and conditions in Author's notice within 
 sixty (60) days after the expiration of such ten (10) day 
 period, or if such transaction is so consummated but the 
 subject rights return to Author for any reason, then 
 Company's rights hereunder shall revive and apply to each 
 18 
 WIYIYISIc.X.0.000c.4151.notOrl vettrissw OotimewstrekvIeco 
 EFTA00037032
further Third Party Offer regarding the subject rights. 
 ii. Author agrees to use commercially reasonable good faith 
 efforts to prevent the Property from becoming public 
 domain material to the extent possible; (to the extent 
 required by law) to cause to be affixed to each copy of the 
 Property or any part thereof published or offered by sale by 
 or with the authority of Author, notice of copyright 
 complying in all respects with the U.S. copyright law and 
 with the Universal Copyright Convention; and to register the 
 Property wherever necessary for such protection. If the 
 Property or any part thereof is unpublished at the time any 
 motion picture or sound record produced hereunder is 
 published or released, it is expressly agreed that any 
 statutory copyright secured by Company in its own name 
 hereunder, covering such motion picture or sound record, 
 shall extend to any and all copyrightable component parts of 
 such motion picture or sound record, and shall be held by 
 Company and that Company may, if it so elects, obtain 
 separate statutory copyright protection for the Property or 
 any part thereof in the name of Company, or otherwise, as 
 it may elect. 
 iii. Author recognizes that a material part of the consideration 
 motivating Company to enter into this Agreement is that 
 Company shall enjoy all rights granted to Company for the 
 full term of any and all of said copyrights (including, without 
 limitation, all extensions of such copyrights, and to the full 
 extent for or at any time hereafter permitted by law, the 
 renewal term of all United States copyrights involved). If any 
 United States statutory copyright in the Property or any part 
 thereof was existing prior to January 1, 1978 and is in its 
 initial term as of the date hereof, Author agrees to make 
 application for, and secure a renewal of, each and even/such 
 United States copyright involved, prior to the expiration of 
 each such copyright, or, if Author is not entitled to renew 
 any such copyright, Author will use its best efforts to cause 
 the person entitled to do so to make application for, and 
 secure a renewal of, such copyright; and in either event 
 Author will promptly notify Company in writing that such 
 renewal copyright has been applied for and has been 
 secured. Promptly after each such copyright has been 
 renewed, Author shall, without payment of any further 
 consideration by Company, execute and deliver to Company, 
 or cause to be executed and delivered to Company, such 
 further instrument or instruments as shall be necessary or 
 proper to vest in Company all of the rights herein granted 
 for the full period of such renewal copyright, upon and 
 subject to all of the identical terms, conditions, limitations, 
 representations, covenants and warranties herein 
 contained, except for the monetary consideration herein 
 specified. Regardless of the execution and delivery of any 
 such instrument, all such rights shall be deemed to have 
 19 
 WIYIYIHeXt0.000a111.1cnotOrnanjilosvy Nom ewe.. etriao 
 EFTA00037033
been acquired by Company under such renewal copyright 
 upon and subject to all of the terms, conditions, limitations, 
 representations, covenants and warranties herein contained 
 simultaneously with the effective date of renewal of such 
 copyright. 
 32. Legal Clearance Upon Company's request, Author shall cooperate with Company 
 or any attorneys for Company or any insurance company 
 providing errors and omissions insurance for the Productions, in 
 connection with the legal clearance of such Productions 
 33. Public Domain 
 Material/Member of 
 the Public 
 Nothing contained in herein: (a) shall at any time limit Company's 
 right to utilize freely, in any work or production, any story, idea, 
 plot, theme, sequence, scene, episode, incident, name, 
 characterization or dialogue or other material which may be in 
 the public domain, whether included in the Property or derived 
 from some other source; or (b) shall be construed to be prejudicial 
 to or operate in derogation of or prejudicial to any rights, 
 licenses, privileges or property which Company may enjoy or be 
 entitled to as a member of the public, as if this Agreement were 
 not in existence. Company may exercise any such rights, licenses, 
 privileges or property at any time and in any manner, whether

 Company (which such appointment is coupled with an interest 
 and hence irrevocable) as Author's attorney-in-fact to execute 
 any such instruments and documents in Author's name and on 
 Author's behalf and to institute and prosecute such 
 proceedings as Company may deem expedient to secure, 
 protect, or enforce the rights Company is acquiring hereunder. 
 Company shall have the right to place the same of record in the 
 U.S. Copyright Office and elsewhere as Company may 
 determine. Company may sue in its own name or may use the 
 names of Author or may join Author as party plaintiff or 
 defendant in any such suit or proceeding. Company shall 
 provide copies of all final documents to Author executed on 
 Author's behalf under this section following Authors request 
 therefor provided, however, inadvertent failure to so provide 
 such documents shall not be a breach hereof. Notwithstanding 
 the failure or omission of any party to this Agreement to 
 execute and/or deliver such additional instruments, it is agreed 
 that upon the exercise of the Option, all rights agreed to be 
 transferred to Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be 
 deemed vested forever in Company, effective as of the date of 
 the exercise of the Option, which rights shall be irrevocable 
 under any and all circumstances, subject to reversion provided 
 for in section 18. 
 b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Author 
 shall execute the short-form assignment (hereinafter, the 
 "Assignment") attached to and incorporated in this Agreement. 
 If Company shall exercise the Option and pay the Series 
 Purchase Price and/or the Film Purchase Price, Author's 
 signature on the Assignment shall be deemed to be effective 
 and the Assignment shall constitute a valid and binding 
 agreement and assignment and shall be deemed to have been 
 executed, and shall be dated and deemed to be effective, as of 
 the date of exercise of the Option. Company is authorized and 
 empowered to date the Assignment accordingly. If Company 
 fails to exercise the Option, then Author's signature on the 
 Assignment shall be void and of no further force and effect 
 whatsoever, and Company shall not be deemed to have 
 acquired any rights in the Property other than the Option 
 provided for in this Agreement. 
 c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Author 
 shall execute and deliver to Company the short-form option 
 agreement (hereinafter, the "Option Agreement") which is 
 attached to and incorporated in this Agreement. Company may 
 record the executed short-form Option Agreement at any time, 
 and may record the executed Assignment (but only after 
 exercise of the Option and payment of the Series Purchase Price 
 and/or the Film Purchase Price) with the U.S. Copyright Office 
 and with the copyright office or comparable registry of any 
 country.

its rights or privileges hereunder, and/or delegate all or any of its 
 obligations hereunder, to any person or entity. In the event of such 
 assignment or delegation, Company shall remain secondarily liable 
 hereunder (unless such assignment or delegation is to a so-called 
 "major' or "mini-major motion picture distributor or television 
 network, any similarly financially responsible party, or any party 
 which substantially controls, is substantially controlled by or is 
 under common control with Company or which through merger, 
 consolidation or acquisition succeeds to substantially all of the 
 assets of Company, and such assignee/delegee assumes in writing 
 all of Company's obligations hereunder, in which event Company 
 shall be released and discharged from all of its obligations 
 hereunder and Author shall look solely to such assignee or delegee, 
 as the case may be, for performance thereof). Author may not 
 assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder, in whole or in part, 
 except with Company's prior written approval, and any such 
 purported assignment shall be deemed null and void. This 
 Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their 
 successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of 
 Company's successors, licensees and assigns. 
 37. Miscellaneous Nothing herein shall be construed to require the commission of 
 any act contrary to law. In the event of any conflict between any 
 provision of this Agreement and any present or future statute, law 
 or regulation, the latter shall prevail and the affected provision of 
 this Agreement shall be modified only to the extent necessary to 
 bring it within legal requirements, such provision shall be deemed 
 stricken from this Agreement to the extent required to bring it 
 within the legal requirements and the remaining terms of this 
 Agreement shall continue in hill force and effect. No waiver by 
 either Party of any failure by the other to perform hereunder shall 
 be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the 
 same or any other obligation. Company may deduct and withhold 
 from Author's compensation all amounts required to be deducted 
 or withheld under any present or future statute, law, ordinance, 
 regulation, order, writ, judgment or decree. 
 38. Entire Agreement This Agreement (including exhibits and all accompanying 
 documents) contains the entire understanding between the 
 Parties regarding this subject matter, supersedes any prior or 
 contemporaneous understandings or agreements between the 
 Parties with respect to Property, whether written or oral, and 
 constitutes a valid and binding agreement. No officer, employee or 
 representative of Company has any authority to make any 
 representation or promise in connection with this Agreement or 
 the subject matter of this Agreement that is not contained in this 
 Agreement and Author has not executed this Agreement in 
 reliance upon any such representation or promise. Any 
 modification or amendment of this Agreement must be in writing 
 and signed by both Parties.

EXHIBIT A 
 DEFINITION OF MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS RECEIPTS (MAGR) 
 a) "Gross Receipts" means all non-returnable, non-refundable revenues actually received and earned 
 by Company (and which are convertible to U.S. currency) in the United States from all sources 
 worldwide in connection with Ancillary Use(s) (as defined below) of the Series (herein, "Project"), 
 if any, including (if and when earned) non-returnable, non-refundable advances specifically related 
 to the Project that otherwise qualify as Gross Receipts, but excluding all: (i) revenues received, 
 earned, allocated, or recorded from distribution, availability, or other exploitation of the Project 
 on Network Services, including, but not limited to, advertising revenue and subscriber fees; (ii) 
 revenues received, earned, allocated, or recorded from distribution, availability, or other 
 exploitation of a Project cycle or episode on Third-Party Network Services (such a cycle, or the cycle 
 of which such episode is a part, the "Applicable Cycle"), (x) which distribution, availability, or 
 exploitation occurs before the end of the six months following the Applicable Cycle's last episode's 
 Premiere during such Applicable Cycle's Premiere ("Premiere" means the first distribution, 
 availability, or other exploitation on any Network Service(s) and/or Third-Party Network Service(s)) 
 (such end date, the "Tail End Date") or (y) which revenues constitute advertising revenue; (iii) 
 Network trademark license fees, Network brand fees, promotional fees, and/or 
 marketing/advertising monies, in each case paid in connection with the Project and/or any 
 Ancillary Uses; (iv) amounts paid or payable to Company to finance development, production, or 
 distribution costs or expenses, or as advances for such amounts, or as reimbursement of such costs 
 or expenses; (v) tax benefits related to the Project, including, but not limited to, tax or other 
 governmental credits or incentives ("Tax Credits") and any foreign tax credits; and (vi) amounts 
 paid or payable to Company in connection with Company furnishing, supplying, rendering, 
 procuring, arranging for, or making available any materials, equipment, facilities, or services in 
 connection with the Project and/or any Ancillary Uses thereof. With respect to revenues received 
 pursuant to agreements that cover other projects in addition to the Project, which revenues would 
 otherwise constitute Gross Receipts: Company will allocate to Gross Receipts a portion 
 (determined in Company's sole good-faith discretion) of such revenues. Participant acknowledges 
 that the foregoing allocation requires the application of subjective factors, and Participant 
 therefore waives any remedy Participant may have at law or equity with respect to Company's 
 allocation of revenues made in accordance with this Paragraph. 
 b) "Modified Adjusted  Gross Receipts" means Gross Receipts less the following items on a continuing 
 basis in the following order: (a) a 15% distribution fee; (b) distribution costs and expenses incurred 
 in connection with distribution and other exploitation of any Ancillary Uses (including, but not 
 limited to, any and all development, production, manufacturing, publishing, publicity, advertising, 
 marketing, promotion, delivery, and guild residual/reuse costs associated with such Ancillary Use, 
 but less all Tax Credits received and credited against such costs and expenses (which Tax Credits 
 are not excluded from Costs deducted pursuant to clause (f) below)) ("Expenses"); (c) the 
 contingent portion of any agency package commission payable on account of any Ancillary Use 
 (defined below); (d) any and all third-party participations payable by Company in connection with 
 the Project, other than those payable to net profit participants; (e) interest on the Costs (as defined 
 below) at an annual percentage rate equal to 2% over and above the rate announced from time to 
 time by J.P. Morgan Chase as its prime rate on unsecured loans ("Interest"); and (f) any and all 
 costs incurred in connection with the development, production, and delivery of the Project (as 
 defined in the Agreement) (including, but not limited to, any amounts payable to Participant) 
 (collectively, "Production Costs"), but less all Tax Credits received and credited against such costs, 
 plus an overhead charge of 15% of the Production Costs and Interest ("Overhead") (Overhead and 
 Production Costs, together "Costs"). 
 24 
 exmwv.ewh, OotimewstrekvIeco 
 EFTA00037038
c) "Ancillary Use(s)" means all distribution, availability, and/or exploitation of the Project, if any, in 
 any manner or media now known or hereafter devised (including, but not limited to, DTO (as 
 defined below)), throughout the universe, in perpetuity, other than (i) on Network Services, (ii) on 
 Third -Party Network Services (x) before the Tail End Date or (y) to the extent revenues therefrom 
 constitute advertising revenue, and (iii) the use or licensing of elements or characters from the 
 Project which were not created by Participant and/or on which Participant did not perform 
 services. "DT0" means the method commonly referred to as download-to-own (DTO) or 
 electronic -sell -through (EST), i.e., permanent download, or the method commonly referred to as 
 download -to -rent (DTR), in each case directly to the consumer through retail digital-distribution 
 services (e.g., 'Tunes or Amazon Video), including (notwithstanding clause (i) of the foregoing 
 sentence) any such services that constitute Network Services, for a discrete charge paid by such 
 consumer for such episode (or "season" or other bundle of episodes). 
 d) "Network Services" means all ViacomCBS Media Networks ("Network") branded and/or affiliated 
 worldwide content distribution services, blocks, and feeds made available on any platform 
 (including television, online, players, areas, applications, etc.) and in any manner (including linear, 
 on -demand, non-permanent download, etc.), by any means of transmission (induding cable, 
 satellite, telecom, intemet, wireless, cellular, etc.), and/or on any device (including television, 
 computer, tablet, mobile, etc.), whether now known or hereafter devised. 
 e) "Third-Party Network Services" means all third-party content distribution services to which 
 Network makes available the Project, which services: make content available to their customers 
 for exhibition on one or more platforms (including television, online, players, areas, applications, 
 etc.) and in any manner (including linear, on-demand, nonpermanent download, etc.), by any 
 means of transmission (including cable, satellite, telecom, intemet, wireless, cellular, etc.), and/or 
 on any device (including television, computer, tablet, mobile, etc.), whether now known or 
 hereafter devised; and charge their customers a subscription or other regular fee for the services 
 and/or sell or display advertising in connection with making content available to customers. Third-
 Party Network Services do not include services or portions of services that charge a per-item 
 transactional fee for the exhibition of one episode, series or project. 
 f) Interest will be charged only on the unrecouped Costs (i.e., (1) the aggregate of all amounts 
 chargeable to Costs, minus (2) the aggregate of Gross Receipts, in each case on a continuing and 
 cumulative basis) as of the midpoint and end-point of the applicable semi-annual accounting 
 period. 
 g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Exhibit or in the Agreement: no 
 exploitation of any subsequent production(s) based on the Project (each such subsequent 
 production a "Derivative Production") (as contrasted with exploitation of the Project) will 
 constitute an Ancillary Use unless the Agreement specifically so provides; if the Agreement does 
 specifically so provide, then, nonetheless if Participant is engaged to render services and/or is 
 entitled to receive contingent compensation in connection with a given Derivative Production then 
 revenue from such Derivative Production will not be included in the calculation of Participant's 
 Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts participation set forth in the Agreement. 
 h) The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of the foregoing sentence, such subsequent 
 productions that are a result of the sale, licensing, or other exploitation of the Project format 
 ("Format Licensing") do constitute Derivative Productions, but because Format Licensing is an 
 exploitation of the Project (and not of a Derivative Production), revenue from Format Licensing 
 itself does not constitute Derivative Production revenue; however, license fees and (provided 
 Participant is not otherwise receiving any contingent participation from such Format Licensing) 
 25 
 %WHS.:rift. MorASIcnot0•11 rarttrWay Nom earyttrekviao 
 EFTA00037039
contingent participation(s) from Format Licensing will be included in the calculation of Gross 
 Receipts. 
 i) Company shall account to Participant with respect to Participant's share of Modified Adjusted 
 Gross Receipts, if any, within 90 days after the end of each semi-annual period in which there are 
 payments due Participant, and such statement of accounting will be accompanied by payment of 
 Participants share (if any) of any monies payable for such semi-annual period. Participant may, at 
 Participants own expense, audit Company's books and records relating to the Project in order to 
 verify statements of accounting rendered hereunder. Each such audit will be conducted solely by 
 a reputable firm of certified public accountants, upon reasonable advance written notice to 
 Company, during reasonable business hours, at Company's offices, and in such manner so as not 
 to interfere with Company's normal business activities, and, concurrently with each report such 
 firm furnishes to Participant, such firm will furnish a true copy thereof to Company. Such right to 
 audit is limited to the Project, and neither Participant nor Participants representative will have the 
 right to examine records relating to Company's business generally, or with respect to any other 
 projects, for purposes of comparison or otherwise. Participant may so audit once per calendar 
 year and each audit may continue for up to 30 consecutive calendar days. The records supporting 
 the statements may not be audited more than once. Company's methods of treating any amount 
 referred to in this Exhibit for tax or financial purposes will have no bearing on the computation of 
 Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts. Each accounting statement furnished by Company pursuant to 
 this Exhibit will be deemed conclusive and binding unless Participant objects thereto to Company 
 in writing within 12 months after the statement is issued, stating in detail the basis for the 
 objection. Participant may not bring any legal proceeding later than the expiration of the period 
 of the applicable statute of limitations established by law or 12 months after making such 
 objection, whichever occurs first. If Company makes any overpayment to Participant hereunder 
 for any reason, Company (a) may deduct and retain for its own account the amount of such 
 overpayment from any amounts that thereafter become due or payable by Company to Participant 
 or for Participants account, or (b) may demand repayment from Participant, in which event 
 Participant shall repay such amount promptly. 
 j) Participant acknowledges that Company is part of a diversified, multifaceted, international 
 company, the commonly-controlled and third-party "affiliates" of which indude, or may in the 
 future include, among others and without limitation, exhibitors; television, online, wireless, 
 application, and other "platforms"; networks, stations, programming services, distributors, video 
 device distributors, cable and/or satellite operators, record companies, video game companies, 
 and publishers (literary and/or electronic); and wholesale and/or retail outlets (individually or 
 collectively, "Affiliated Companyfiesr). Participant further acknowledges that Company has the 
 right in its sole discretion to make use of Affiliated Companies in connection with the distribution 
 and exploitation of the Project as, when, and where Company deems it appropriate to do so. With 
 respect to Company's dealings with commonly-controlled Affiliated Companies, Participant 
 expressly waives any right to object to such distribution and exploitation of the Project (or aspects 
 thereof) or assert any daim that Company should have offered the applicable 
 distribution/exploitation rights to third parties (in lieu of, or in addition to, offering the same to 
 commonly -controlled Affiliated Companies). In consideration thereof, if Company enters into any 
 agreement with a commonly-controlled Affiliated Company with respect to any disposition of 
 rights in the Project, the consideration for which falls within the definition of Gross Receipts 
 hereunder, then Gross Receipts shall be credited with an amount equal to the reasonable value of 
 such rights as determined by Company in its reasonable business judgment. Participant 
 acknowledges and agrees that Participants sole remedy against Company for any alleged failure 
 by Company to comply with the terms of this subparagraph will be money damages, and Participant 
 26 
 1YIYISic.X.0 Mor111. knot. •iniee.trissre Nom wort etrI. /co 
 EFTA00037040
hereby waives any right to seek or obtain preliminary or permanent equitable relief in connection 
 with any such alleged failure. 
 k) If any provision(s) (or any portion(s) of any provision(s)) in this Agreement conflicts) or could be 
 interpreted to conflict with this paragraph for any reason (including, without limitation, any 
 references to court, jurisdiction, judiciary, jury, action-at-law, or any other terms), the terms of this 
 paragraph will control. Participant and Company agree that any and all controversies, claims or 
 disputes arising out of or relating to this Exhibit and/or the conduct of the Parties hereunder or in 
 connection herewith ("Dispute") will be the subject of good faith negotiation. If after good faith 
 negotiation the Dispute is not resolved, and either party wishes to pursue the matter further, the 
 Parties agree that the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration at the New York 
 City office of JAMS, or its successor ("JAMS"), pursuant to the procedure set forth in subparagraph 
 A. below. (A.) The arbitration will be initiated and conducted according to either the JAMS 
 Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) 
 Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as modified herein, in effect at the time the request for 
 arbitration is made (the "Arbitration Rules"). The Parties agree that a Dispute will include the 
 determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate and the arbitrability of 
 the Dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim of waiver. The arbitration will be conducted 
 before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Unless the 
 Parties agree otherwise, the neutral arbitrator will be a former or retired judge or justice of any 
 New York state or federal court with substantial experience in matters involving the entertainment 
 industry, who is affiliated with JAMS. The arbitrator will follow New York law in adjudicating the 
 Dispute. The arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision which will be part of 
 the arbitration award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding except to the extent that 
 limited judicial review is permitted by applicable law. The Parties are to share the arbitration costs 
 and the arbitrators fees equally. Each party will remain responsible for its own attorneys' fees. The 
 Parties waive the right to seek punitive damages and the arbitrator will have no authority to award 
 such damages. All arbitration proceedings will be dosed to the public and confidential, and all 
 records relating thereto will be permanently sealed. Neither the Parties nor the arbitrator will 
 disclose the existence, content, testimony, evidence or results of the arbitration, except as 
 necessary to comply with legal, statutory or regulatory requirements. Before making any such 
 disclosure, a party will give written notice to all other parties and will afford such parties a 
 reasonable opportunity to protect their interests. If either party refuses to perform any or all of its 
 obligations under the final arbitration award within thirty (30) days of such award being rendered, 
 then the other party may confirm or enforce the final award in any court of competent jurisdiction 
 in New York County, New York. All Parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and 
 federal courts located in New York County, New York for purposes of confirming or enforcing any 
 arbitration award. This clause will not preclude the Parties from seeking provisional remedies in 
 aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York. (B.) The 
 Parties acknowledge that this provision constitutes a waiver of each party's rights to a civil court 
 action or a jury trial concerning matters covered by this provision; only an arbitrator, not a judge 
 or jury, will decide the Dispute.

 Re: Jane Doe 1 v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-10019 (JSR) 
 Dear Ms. 
 Thank you for trusting me to evaluate your claims as part of the Epstein Survivors' Settlement 
 Fund JPM (the "Epstein JPM Fund"). It has been an honor to be the Claims Administrator in 
 this matter. Given the difficult nature of this process, please take care of yourself after reading 
 this letter and seek support as needed. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have 
 the meaning set forth and defined in the Stipulation of Settlement dated June 22, 2023 (the "JPM 
 Stipulation") [ECF No. 181-1]. 
 I have fully evaluated all Questionnaires and Releases submitted to me from Participating 
 Claimants and this letter ("Determination Notice") constitutes notice of your Allocated Amount. 
 After considering your Questionnaire and Release using the guidelines and evaluation factors 
 enumerated in Section 5.2 of the JPM Stipulation and the totality of the circumstances, I have 
 determined your Allocated Amount is One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00). Massive, LLC has 
 advised that there is no withholding required as a result of medical liens and your distribution 
 will be made upon receipt of signed payment instructions. Please execute the attached form to 
 indicate where your Allocated Amount should be wired. 
 Per Section 5.4 of the JPM Stipulation, the Allocated Amount determined for each Participating 
 Claimant is final and non-appealable. 
 The payment that will be made from the Epstein JPM Fund to you is intended to be for damages 
 for personal physical injuries or physical sickness or emotional distress from physical sickness or 
 physical injuries. Accordingly, you will not be issued an IRS Form 1099 and recommend that 
 you seek advice based on your particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor to 
 confirm that the payment is excludable from taxable gross income under 26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(2) 
 or, if applicable, under the laws of your home country. 
 EFTA00037059
January 16, 2024 
 Page 2 of 2 
 If you have any uestions or concerns about this Determination Notice you may contact me at 
 or counsel by phone at or email at 
 The JPM Stipulation and referenced sections herein can be found at 
 www.epsteinSSFJPM.com under the Case Documents tab. 
 I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that the U.S. Virgin Islands ("GVI") has 
 established a mental health fund (the "Mental Health Fund") to provide a financial resource for 
 mental health services for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein that I will be administering. As a Class 
 Member of both the Epstein DB Fund and the Epstein JPM Fund, you are eligible to apply for 
 approved mental health treatment as recommended by a mental health provider. Information 
 about the Mental Health Fund and instructions for submitting an application and treatment plan 
 can be found at the dedicated website set up for this fund: www.USVIMentalHealthFund.com.
 The Mental Health Fund will launch on January 16, 2024. 
 Respectfully, 
 IANIA

 Re: Your Settlement with Epstein JPM Fund 
 Dear 
 As you know, we are receiving compensation from the Epstein JPM Fund on your behalf. 
 You have asked and authorized us to wire you funds, and you have confirmed receipt of our test 
 wire of $1.36, so as soon as feasible we will wire you your settlement disbursement. 
 Attached is our invoice detailing the hours, expenses, etc. Summarized as follows: 
 Gross Settlement Amount $1,000,000.00 
 Less Fees and Costs Billed to You $75,000.00 
 Net Disbursement to You $925,000.00 
 We are not tax attorneys and therefore cannot advise on tax issues. In the past, we have 
 consulted with a New York tax lawyer who advised us that he is of the view that the settlement 
 amount should be treated as damages received on account of "personal physical injury" and 
 therefore not to be subject to federal income tax. However, the law on this issue is unclear, which 
 means we cannot say with certainty whether the Internal Revenue Service will agree that the 
 settlement amount is not taxable. We encourage you to discuss any tax issues with your tax 
 accountant or tax attorney. You are also welcome to contact the Law Office of Asher Harris 
 concerning the taxability of your settlement. If you want to engage with Mr. Harris directly, please 
 contact him at You will be solely responsible for the costs of any 
 consultation with him. 
 Our entire team at Marsh Law was honored to represent you in your pursuit of justice and 
 accountability in this case. Although no amount of money can ever undo all the harm that was 
 caused by Jeffrey Epstein, we sincerely hope that pursuing this matter and receiving this settlement 
 can provide some small measure of recompense and resolution. 
 EFTA00037088
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about your settlement. 
 Otherwise, this concludes our legal representation of you on this matter. We truly wish you the 
 best 
 Very truly yours, 
 MARSH LAW FIRM PLLC

 We'd like to do it up as a story, if that's OK with you. 
 Two things -
 1) how do you feel about us saying it was you who rang them? Absolutely no pressure - we can withhold your name if you would like us to. 
 2) do you mind my forwarding the audio to him? He's very much someone we can trust. 
 He will then ask SY why they are so disinterested in a hugely important case.

 No way, I want this on the record! Publish the whole thing if you have to. 
 The British public deserve to know the truth and what to do if they are ever raped or trafficked outside the UK or at least should know the procedure.

 Claims Administrator and Class Members. It also refers to a conflict with Class Counsel, claiming 
 without substantiation that Class Counsel "has maintained personal and professional relationships 
 with Epstein's known associates with inadequate disclosure about the nature and scope of those 
 relationships including prior law partners." ECF No. 247, at 6. Ms. declaration is 
 more direct: it accuses the Claims Administrator and Class Counsel of having "multiple conflicts 
 of interest." ECF No. 247-1 ¶ 25; see also id. at ¶¶ 13, 26. These claims are meritless.1° Ms. 
 2023-11-02 Class Council Objection .pdf 
 Ransome provides no basis for her allegations of conflict, and the Court therefore has no reason to 
 doubt that the Settlement is "fair, reasonable, and adequate," and "the result of good faith, 
 extensive arm's-length and non-collusive negotiations." ECF No. 182 ¶¶ 1, 2.

 Honorable Jed S: Rakoff 
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse 
 500 Pearl Street 
 Room 1340 
 New York, NY 10007 
 Re: Doe v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 1:22-CV-10019 (S.D.N.Y.) 
 Dear Judge Rakoff: 
 The Attorneys General of New Mexico, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the 
 District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Oregon, 
 Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont write concerning the proposed settlement in Doe v. 
 JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 1:22-CV-10019 (S.D.N.Y.) because it contains language that 
 purports to release state Attorney General parens patriae claims under Section 1595(d) of the 
 Trafficking Victims Protection Act ("TVPA") for damages on behalf of trafficking victims. 
 The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 requires that settlement defendants in a class 
 action serve notice of the settlement on the appropriate state officials, thereby giving them an 
 opportunity to review and respond to the settlement prior to its approval. The legislative history 
 of CAFA establishes "that notice of class action settlements be sent to appropriate state and 
 federal officials ... so that they may voice concerns if they believe that the class action settlement 
 is not in the best interests of their citizens." S. REP. 109-14, 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 6. Case law 
 also recognizes this role of state Attorneys General. See, e.g., Figueroa v. Sharper Image Corp., 
 517 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1301 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (noting role of Attorneys General in class 
 settlement approval process); True v. American Honda Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1082 
 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (discussing views of state Attorneys General with respect to class action 
 settlement grounded in products liability claims). Since the passage of the Act, state Attorneys 
 General have successfully objected to or brought about the modification of settlements which 
 were unfair to its citizens. 
 Section 1595(d) gives state Attorneys General authority, as parens patriae, to civilly 
 prosecute persons who engage in sex-trafficking as set forth in Section 1591 of the TVPA and 
 to obtain appropriate relief. The undersigned have reviewed the proposed settlement agreement 
 in this case and have significant concerns about the potentially precedential scope of the release in 
 Section 1.25, which the New Mexico Attorney General's Office raised with counsel for JPMorgan. 
 While the issue is now mooted as to the U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General by its parallel 
 settlement with JPMorgan, allowing such a broad release of claims may have serious implications 
 for future cases brought by state law enforcement against perpetrators of sex-trafficking under the 
 TVPA. 
 Section 1.25 releases claims

Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 248-1 Filed 10/23/23 Page 2 of 5 
 that could be brought to recover damages from the Released Defendant Parties on 
 behalf of a Member of the Class by any other party, including any sovereign or 
 government, relating to or arising from any Member of the Class's harm, injury, 
 abuse, exploitation, or trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein or by any person who is in any 
 way connected to or otherwise associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as well as any right 
 to recovery on account thereof. (Emphasis added.) 
 The Doe settlement with Deutsche Bank, by contrast, does not contain the same language releasing 
 "any sovereign or government" claims.' 
 In adding Section 1595(d) to the civil remedy section of the TVPA, which previously only 
 explicitly recognized victim suits, Congress intended to "unleash" the power of state law 
 enforcement to prosecute these heinous sex-trafficking crimes, recognizing that, in many 
 circumstances, victims are unable or unwilling to come forward and "more prosecutors," "more 
 investigators," and "more resources" are needed to "address this growing problem throughout our 
 country." 164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08, 2018 WL 1415914, at *S1864. "This amendment is needed 
 in order to give enhanced powers to State attorneys general that they can provide the extra litigation 
 leverage for individuals who are impacted in a devastating manner." 164 Cong. Rec. H1290-02, 
 2018 WL 1073890, at *H1303. If broad releases of non-party state Attorneys General law 
 enforcement actions under the TVPA seeking victim-specific relief were deemed permissible 
 without their express consent, state Attorneys General may be deterred from bringing these 
 important civil law enforcement actions in the future — upsetting Congress' very purpose in 
 amending the TVPA to add state law enforcement. 
 States have frequently been allowed to sue in parens patriae to enforce federal statutes, 
 both at common law, see, e.g., Snapp, 458 U.S. 592 (Puerto Rico had standing to sue in parens 
 patriae under the Wagner-Peyser Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act on behalf of its 
 migrant farm workers); New York v. II Cornwell Co., 695 F.2d 34 (2d Cir. 1982) (New York had

 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (collecting cases), and by statute, see, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 6504(a)(1); 15 U.S.C. § 
 7706(0(1); 18 U.S.C. § 248(c)(3). 
 States may seek damages for residents within their authority as parens patriae. See New 
 York by Abrams v. General Motors Corp., 547 F Supp at 706-07 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) ("The State's 
 goal of securing an honest marketplace in which to transact business is a quasi-sovereign interest

 Courts outside the Second Circuit agree. See Illinois v. AU Optronics Corp., 794 F. Supp. 
 2d 845, 853 (ND. 111. 2011) ("As many courts have held, a State is not automatically rendered a 
 nominal party when it seeks both broad injunctive relief and monetary damages for injured 
 residents") (emphasis in original); id. at 858 (Attorney General enforcement action against 
 violators, including "to pursue relief on behalf of aggrieved individuals ...is more analogous to 
 the role of the EEOC or other regulator when it brings an action on behalf of a large group of 
 employees or a segment of the public"); In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 2011 WL 
 560693, at *5 (ND. Cal. Feb. 15, 2011) ("The damages that California seeks, while on behalf of 
 its consumers, would first be paid to the State and distributed on an equitable basis. The fact that 
 private parties may benefit from the States' actions does not negate the State's substantial interests 
 in these cases."); New Mexico by Balderas v. Real Estate Law Ctr., P.C., 430 F. Supp. 3d 761, 875 
 (D.N.M. 2019) ("New Mexico has authority to bring the suit parens patriae and to seek restitution 
 for [aggrieved individuals]"); West Virginia by McGraw v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 842 F. Supp.

 to enforce its laws, disgorge the proceeds of ill-gotten gains, and refund them to its citizens."). 
 Federal appeals courts have consistently held that private parties lack the authority to 
 release a government's claims for relief to vindicate sovereign or quasi-sovereign interests 
 belonging to the state or government. See Sec 'y United States Dept Lab. v. Kwasny, 853 F.3d 87, 
 90, 95-96 (3d Cir. 2017) (private judgment does not preclude subsequent enforcement action by 
 the Secretary of Labor for recovery of damages implicated in the prior judgment; the government's 
 "interest in maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, the pension system" is "broader 
 than the interests of private litigations"); US. Commodity Future Trading Comm 'n v. Kratville, 
 796 F.3d 873, 889 (8th Cir. 2015) ("quite apart from whether the individual victims are satisfied 
 with their private settlements, full and ample restitution [and] disgorgement of profits, serve

 remedy); Herman v. South Carolina Nat'l Bank, 140 F.3d 1413, 1424 (1 1 th Cir. 1998) (private

 600); Snapp, 458 U.S. at 602 (distinguishing quasi-sovereign interest from where a State attempts

 1987) ("[w]here the complaint only seeks to recover money damages for injuries suffered by 
 individuals" the state lacks parens patriae standing) (emphasis added); In re Baldwin-United Corp., 
 770 F.2d 328, 341 (2d Cir. 1985) ("when the state merely asserts the personal claims of its citizens, 
 it is not the real party in interest and cannot claim parens patriae standing") (emphasis added). 
 Even if the State lacks common law parens patriae capacity to prosecute a suit "only ... to recover 
 money damages for injuries suffered by individuals," Seneci, 817 F.2d at 1017 (emphasis added), 
 California v. Frito-Lay, Inc., on which Seneci relies, concludes a state can be "empowered to act" 
 to seek damages on behalf of individuals, but "that authority must come through ... legislation,"

 Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. Hartigan, 816 F.2d 1177, 1181 n.4 (7th Cir. 1989) (state attorney 
 general was not bound by private litigation, "to assume that private individuals can be properly 
 viewed as representative of a particular government is a ... daring analytical leap"); see also Beck 
 v. Levering, 947 F.2d 639, 642 (2d Cir. 1991) (resjudicata does not prohibit Secretary of Labor 
 "from recovering monetary relief that duplicates the relief granted in the prior action"). 
 In New York by Cuomo v. Coventry First LLC, the court held that the arbitration agreement 
 between defendants and their alleged victims "does not bar the [New York] Attorney General from 
 pursuing victim-specific judicial relief [including damages] in his enforcement action." 13 N.Y. 
 3d 108, 112, 114 (2009). "Like the EEOC, the Attorney General should not be limited, in his duty 
 to protect the public interest, by an [] agreement he did not join. Such an arrangement between 
 private parties cannot alter the Attorney General's statutory role or the remedies that he is 
 empowered to seek." Id. at 14? 
 The undersigned do not object to any other aspect of the Doe settlement and believe that 
 Jeffrey Epstein's surviving victims should be fully compensated for the profound ham they have 
 suffered. However, as it now stands, the settlement agreement improperly seeks to release States' 
 parens patriae claims for victim-specific relief and should be amended to make clear that such 
 claims are not released. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 Ratil Torrez 
 New Mexico Attorney General 
 3 Any damages recovered in a state law enforcement case under the TVPA would only add to, not 
 undo, any victims' recovery, and would protect absent non-responding class members whose 
 claims may otherwise be released by a settlement. Further, to the extent that the state Attorneys 
 General obtain victim-specific relief, including damages or restitution, courts can set off the 
 amounts paid to class members against any recovery by the state attorneys general. See EEOC v. 
 Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 295a96 (2002) (EEOC could not obtain double recovery based 
 on prior settlement and acknowledging prior private settlement amounts would be offset from 
 government recovery); Beck, 947 F.2d at 642 (same). The possibility of a post-judgment setoff of 
 damages in a state's case does not support a wholesale release of the state's claim for that relief.

 CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT 
 OBJECTIONS TO PROPOSED SETTLEMENT 
 INCLUDING NOTICE OF INTENT TO APPEAR AT FAIRNESS HEARING 
 Class Member by and through her attorneys of record, Marsh Law Firm 
 PLLC, hereby makes the following objections to the Settlement of this Litigation, in accordance 
 with the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation of Settlement dated June 22, 2023 
 (the "Stipulation"). The objections stated herein apply to the Objector individually as well as to a 
 particular subset of the putative class members.' 
 Pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("FRCP"), the Court may 
 approve a proposal only upon a finding that it is "fair, reasonable, and adequate." As set forth 
 herein, Objector objects to the terms of the Stipulation as failing to satisfy the requirements of 
 FRCP Rule 23 and therefore, the proposed Stipulation should be rejected. In tv Michael Milken 
 & Assocs. Sec. Litig., 150 F.R.D. 57, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) ("[t]he ultimate test for the exercise of 
 Objector hereby incorporates by reference herein the Objections set forth in Jane Doe #7's 
 Objections (Dkt. 218).

 the Court's discretion in approving a settlement of a class action pursuant to Rule 23 is whether 
 the settlement, taken as a whole, is fair, adequate, and reasonable"). 
 OBJECTOR'S STATUS AS A CLASS MEMBER 
 Objector is a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") and qualifies as a Class Member of 
 the preliminarily certified class with standing to object to the proposed Stipulation as provided in 
 the Stipulation and Notice in this case. Before, during, and after the relevant time period defining 
 the Class, Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates sexually abused and trafficked 
 Objector and forced, coerced, and defrauded her into engaging in a myriad of sexually explicit 
 acts. As a result, Objector has suffered grievous psychological harm including depression, 
 anxiety, fatigue, flashbacks, cold sweats, terror, indescribable pain, and far more. The injuries 
 Objector has suffered as a result of the abuse, trafficking, threats, deception, and aftermath will 
 last throughout her entire life. 
 As detailed in her Declaration, Objector objects to the terms of the Stipulation as being 
 unfair, unreasonable, and inadequate to provide the Class Members with relief for the 
 inexplicable and irreparable emotional, psychological, physical, and financial harms they have 
 suffered. In support of her objections, Objector submits the accompanying Declaration of 
 Objector/Class Member 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND RELEVANT FACTS 
 On June 29, 2023, this Court granted preliminary approval of the proposed Settlement of 
 the Litigation and Stipulation to "resolve the claims of all persons who were harmed, injured, 
 exploited, or abused by Jeffrey Epstein, or by any person who is connected to or otherwise 
 associated with Jeffrey Epstein or any Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking venture, between January 1, 
 1998, and through August 10, 2019, inclusive" in the action entitled Jane Doe 1 v. JPMoigan 
 2 
 EFTA00037110
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 3 of 9 
 Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 1:22-CV-10019 (JSR) ("JPMorgan Action") (Dkt. No. 182). A 
 Settlement Hearing was scheduled for November 9, 2023, to "determine whether the proposed 
 Settlement of the litigation on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation is fair, 
 reasonable, and adequate to the Class and should be approved by the Court." (Dkt. No. 182, ¶3). 
 The Court further stated that "[a]ny Class Member may appear at the Settlement Hearing and 
 object is she has any reason why the proposed Settlement of the Litigation should not be 
 approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate...provided that such Class Member" file written 
 objections with the Court on or before October 19, 2023. (Dkt. 182, ¶17). Accordingly, Objector 
 raises the objections outlined herein as to why the Settlement and Stipulation should be denied. 
 Finally, this Court instructed that although attendance at the Settlement Hearing is "not 
 necessary," if a Class Member or person wishes "to be heard orally in opposition to the approval 
 of the Settlement," they are "required to indicate in their written objection their intention to appear 
 at the hearing." (Dkt. 182, ¶17). Objector hereby indicates her intent to appear (virtually) at the 
 Settlement Hearing in the JPMorgan Action scheduled for November 9, 2023, and respectfully 
 requests that she be heard orally by this Court during the Settlement Hearing on her opposition to 
 the Settlement of the Litigation and Stipulation.2
 OBJECTIONS 
 FRCP Rule 23 "requires judicial approval for any class action settlement." In re GSE 
 Bonds Antitrust Litig., 414 F. Supp. 3d 686, 691 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). To approve a settlement, "the 
 Court must find that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate." Id.; In /V Initial Pub. Offering Sec. 
 2 Objector requests that she be permitted to (i) attend the Settlement Hearing virtually and (ii) be 
 heard orally on her Objections to the Settlement of the Litigation and Stipulation. Objector 
 hereby includes a letter from the undersigned to the Honorable Jed R. Rakoff on application to 
 appear virtually and be heard orally at the Settlement Hearing.

Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 4 of 9 
 Litig., 243 F.R.D. 79, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) ("[u]nlike settlements in ordinary suits, the settlement 
 of a class action must be approved by the court. The court owes a duty to class members to 
 ensure that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate"). The proposed Settlement 
 and Stipulation at issue should be rejected because it fails to meet the requirements of approval 
 set forth under Rule 23. 
 First, the Plan of Allocation provides insufficient information regarding how the 
 settlement funds will be allocated and the size of the potential awards. Geiss v. Weinstein Co. 
 Holdings LLC, 474 F. Supp. 3d 628, 637 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (denying the proposed settlement 
 because the proposal provided insufficient information as to the "size of the potential awards" 
 and "how the funds would be allocated"). For example, the Plan of Allocation provides that 
 "[t]he Claims Administrator...shall determine a Class Member's assigned settlement amount (the 
 "Allocated Amount"), from the Global Settlement Amount," and shall consider certain factors in 
 making her determination including, the Class Members' questionnaires and releases and the 
 supporting documentation thereto and the circumstances giving rise to the alleged harms. (Dkt. 
 181-2). The Plan of Allocation leaves the determination of individuals' settlement amounts 
 entirely up to the Claims Administrator's discretion without providing clear guidelines as to how 
 the Claims Administrator's assessment will be carried out or the amounts that will be assigned 
 based on injury. Allocating funds in this way is completely arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable, and 
 inadequate to benefit the Class Members. 
 In Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, the court denied the proposed settlement, in part, 
 due to the "underdeveloped guidelines" of the proposal which were "likely to lead to arbitrary 
 awards for claimants." 474 F. Supp. 3d 628, 636 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). The court stated that "in 
 assessing the adequacy of relief," it must consider "the effectiveness of any proposed method of 
 4 
 EFTA00037112
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 5 of 9 
 distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims." Id. 
 There, the court found that "critical considerations as to the availability and scope of recovery 
 [were] delegated to a non-judicial officer...with insufficient guidelines tested by adversarial 
 process and pit-trial discovery." Id. citing Chi v. Univ. of S. Cal., No. 2:18-cv-04258, 2019 WL 
 3064457, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2019) (holding that, in a sexual abuse class action, "the 
 contemplated authority of the" non-judicial officer "to make all claims determinations in her own 
 discretion invites the possibility of arbitrary decision-making and inequitable treatment of class 
 members for non-meritorious reasons"). The same holds true here. On that basis, Objector 
 objects to the Plan of Allocation. 
 Likewise, Objector objects to the Notice of Settlement because it provides insufficient 
 information to the Class Members regarding the terms of the proposed settlement and the options 
 available to the Class Members. In re PaineWebber Ltd. Partnerships Litig., 171 F.R.D. 104, 124 
 (S.D.N.Y.) ("[n]otice of settlement in a class action must fairly apprise the prospective members 
 of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement and of the options that are open to them in 
 connection with [the] proceedings") (internal quotations omitted). 
 Second, the Proposed Cash Award (totaling $290 million) is objected to class wide where 
 it does not have any relation to the damages the members of the class have sustained. The 
 Proposed Cash Award is insufficient to deter the Defendants from continuing their conduct of 
 facilitating crimes that target the class and provides inadequate benefit to the class given the 
 severe damages the Class Members have sustained. In re Subway Footlong Sandwich Mktg. & 
 Sales Practices Litig., 869 F.3d 551, 556-557 (7th Cir. Aug. 25, 2017); Polar Intl Brokerage 
 Corp. v. Reeve, 187 F.R.D. 108, 114 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (finding that the proposed settlement was 
 "virtually worthless" because the class members were obtaining nothing more than 
 5 
 EFTA00037113
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 6 of 9 
 "reassurance"). In determining whether to approve a proposed settlement, the Court must "ensure 
 that the class gets the best settlement possible" and if the settlement is found unfair because the 
 class members will receive nothing of value, then "class members are better off retaining their 
 legal rights to maintain suit rather than accepting the settlement." Id. 
 The proposed claim values and limitations were apparently devised under an agreement 
 that was not based on any reasonable or fair assessment of the individual Class Members' 
 damages or class wide expectations of settlement. Accordingly, Objector objects to the Proposed 
 Cash Award and requests that she and the other Class Members be afforded the opportunity to 
 retain their legal rights to pursue litigation against the Defendants. 
 Third, neither Class Counsel nor the Claims Administrator have been questioned about 
 potential conflicts of interest with the Class Members and other related individuals and entities. 
 In this case, the parties were not afforded the benefit of full and meaningful discovery before a 
 proposed settlement was reached. Nor were the Class Members consulted concerning 
 appointment of the Claims Administrator. If discovery had been fully conducted and completed, 
 any potential relevant conflicts of interest would have become apparent. Class Counsel has 
 participated in numerous prior actual or contemplated litigation against Epstein and his 
 associates and various past and present claimants some of whom have conflicts of interest 
 between and amongst themselves. Similarly, Class Counsel has maintained personal and 
 professional relationships with Epstein's known associates with inadequate disclosure about the 
 nature and scope of those relationships including prior law partners. Given the foregoing, it is 
 debatable whether the proposed Settlement and Stipulation were negotiated and agreed upon 
 with the best interests of the Class Members in mind. In class actions such as this one, "a 
 searching judicial inquiry is required" prior to approving a proposed settlement "since the

 settlement will bind those who had not had their day in court." Han v. BHH, LLC, 334 F.R.D. 74, 
 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). 
 Objector objects to the Class Counsel and Claims Administrator and respectfully requests 
 that the Court deny the proposed Settlement and Stipulation and allow the Class Members to 
 proceed with discovery and litigation in pursuit of fair, reasonable, and adequate compensation. 
 Reynolds v. Beneficial Nat'l Bank, 288 F.3d 277, 284 (7th Cir. 2002) (declining the proposed 
 settlement and disqualifying class counsel because the evidence demonstrated that class counsel 
 attempted to settle the action without first undertaking sufficient discovery to estimate class 
 damages). To approve the Settlement and Stipulation at this juncture would be in direct 
 contravention of the Court's duty to conduct a searching judicial inquiry into the conflict of 
 interests that exist in this action. In re Iconix Brand Group, Inc., No. 1:15-CV-04860-PGG, 2020 
 WL 6784181, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 2020) (noting that where a conflict of interest exists, the 
 Court is under an obligation "to exercise the highest degree of vigilance in scrutinizing proposed 
 settlements of class actions"). 
 Fourth, the Class Counsel, Claims Administrator, Class Representative fees are excessive 
 and should be denied. "In a class-action settlement, courts must carefully scrutinize lead 
 counsel's application for attorneys' fees to ensure that the interests of class members are not 
 subordinated to the interests of...class counsel." Hart v. Nig LLC, 334 F.R.D. 74, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2020). "Attorneys fees' are awarded at the discretion of the court." Id. Similarly, with respect to 
 the Class Representative, any proposed settlement should be "commensurate with the work, 
 time, and effort the class representative spent on the case including their emotional investment, 
 the risk of retaliation, and any strain it may have put on their family or personal life." Ridgeway 
 v. Walmart Inc., 269 F. Supp. 3d 975, 1003 (N.D. Cal. 2017).

 Here, Class Counsel is requesting thirty percent of the Global Settlement Amount phrs 
 costs, charges, and expenses not to exceed $2,500,000, plus interest earned on both amounts. The 
 Claims Administrator's fees and the Class Representative's fees will also be deducted from the 
 Global Settlement Amount at the discretion of the Court. It is concerning that Class Counsel is 
 requesting such a hefty amount of fees without knowing the total recovery for each individual 
 class member. Cooks v. TNG GP, No. 2:16-CV-01160-KJM-AC, 2020 WL 5535397, at *8 (E.D. 
 Cal. Sept. 15, 2020) ("[a] disproportionate award to counsel is a subtle sign that class counsel 
 have allowed pursuit of their own self-interests and that of certain class members to infect the 
 negotiations"). 
 With respect to the Class Representative, although Objector agrees that the representative 
 should be fairly compensated for taking on such an important job, the amount awarded to the 
 Class Representative should not be deducted from the Global Settlement. Rather, the amount 
 awarded to Jane Doe 1 should be capped and deducted from the attorneys' fees. Here, Jane Doe 1 
 is not the only victim that invested substantial time, effort, and emotion into this matter. In order 
 to demonstrate she is entitled to receive a portion of the Settlement Fund, the Objector (and 
 many other Class Members) are required by the Plan of Allocation to submit a questionnaire and 
 release detailing the abuse and trafficking they experienced as part of the Epstein sex trafficking 
 enterprise. In doing so, Objector also expended much time and effort and was required to become 
 emotionally involved in yet another action against Epstein and re-live the traumatic events giving 
 rise to the harms alleged herein. Not only does the foregoing represent a personally challenging 
 process "contrived to discourage claims," but it also demonstrates that the Class Representative 
 should not be entitled to a fee from the Class Members' Global Settlement. Gascho v. Glob. 
 Fitness Holdings, LLC, 822 F.3d 269, 287 (6th Cir. 2016). Objector objects to the Class

Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 9 of 9 
 Representative's fee because it should not be deducted from the Global Settlement that Objector 
 (and so many others) so rightfully deserve. 
 Likewise, the Claims Administrator's fee should not be deducted from the Global 
 Settlement. The fee for claims administration should be deducted from the attorneys' fees and 
 capped at a limited percentage. On this basis, Objector objects to the fees for Class Counsel, 
 Class Administrator, and Class Representative. 
 CONCLUSION 
 Given the foregoing, the Objector objects to the Settlement and Stipulation in its entirety 
 as being unfair, unreasonable, and inadequate in direct contravention of FRCP Rule 23 and 
 applicable law. Accordingly, the proposed Settlement of the Litigation and Stipulation should be 
 denied, and this Court should permit litigation to proceed against the Defendants.

 civil litigation. Ms. Nappi has been selected by Super Lawyers as Metro Rising Star in civil 
 litigation from 2018 through 2022. 
 Ms. Nappi leads the firm's Victims' Rights practice group and provides a trauma-informed 
 approach to all of our clients. She is litigating hundreds of cases on behalf of survivors of 
 sexual abuse and assault against several institutions - both public and private - in the wake of 
 the passage of New York and New Jersey's revival statutes allowing once time-barred claims to 
 be heard. Ms. Nappi has successfully resolved these sexual abuse cases prior to trial, 
 resulting in millions of dollars in recovery for survivors. Ms. Nappi is also representing 
 plaintiffs across the county in §1983 actions and has secured recoveries as a result of their 
 discrimination. 
 Prior to joining the Firm, Ms. Nappi spent nine years working at the law offices of Boies 
 Schiller & Flexner LLP. While in law school, Ms. Nappi worked as a legal assistant/paralegal to 
 the firm's Chairman, David Boies. After her admission to the bar, Ms. Nappi was promoted to 
 Staff Attorney. As a Staff Attorney, Ms. Nappi was on the trial team assigned to work on Starr 
 International v. The United States, No. 1:11-cv-00779-TCW. At the time, the case was the largest 
 ever filed against the United States Government, alleging that the Government's acquisition of 
 AIG equity and subsequent actions relating to a reverse stock split were unlawful. Ms. Nappi

 I have the right to legal representation to which you are 
 denying me. I also have a right to freedom of speech. 
 I invoke article 51 and would like to be referred to a human 
 rights attorney. 
 How you guys have treated me too is not ok.
