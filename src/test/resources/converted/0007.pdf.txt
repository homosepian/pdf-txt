 If helpful, the attached email from our counterparts at Main and BOP lays out the BOP's understanding of and media 
 strategy for today's production of Epstein materials to the Times. As discussed previously, we've agreed to have them to 
 refer inquiries to us. They've also asked for guidance on timing. Thanks! 
 Subject: RE: Epstein FOIA 
 All, 
 FYI, lust called from Main (I believe she's still at Fed Programs). She said there was interest from the AG's 
 Office in the release and had some questions. We talked through things, and she said she'd carry the info back. She said 
 she or someone else from DC might follow up. 
 Thanks, 
 Steven 
 Subject: Epstein FOIA 
 Morning. Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. 
 She asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn't a problem. Other than process 
 questions, and I anticipate declining to comment anyway.

 Our grand jury subpoenas are to obtain evidence that would relate to a crime, and I'm not sure that this would be 
 reasonably related to evidence for the sex trafficking investigation, which is what we are working on. Are you not able to 
 simply request these materials from the relevant offices? If not, and if this is in connection with an investigation into his 
 death, I think you would need to have a subpoena issued in connection with the team that is working on that investigation

 I United States v. Maxwell, 20cr330 
 2 Preliminary Remarks Prior to Voir Dire 
 3 To be recorded and played on 11/16-11/19 
 4 Introduction 
 5 Welcome back to the Southern District. Thank you again for your time and service. As I 
 6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I 
 7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the 
 8 first step in the July selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be 
 9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go 
 to through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrow if 
 11 necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process. 
 12 That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process 
 13 today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you. 
 14 As you know from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today 
 15 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As 
 16 you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and 
 17 aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex 
 I8 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking 
 19 of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, 
 20 and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has 
 21 proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 22 Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal 
 23 case is a critical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who 
 24 can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. Some people find that they can be fair and 
 EFTA00030633
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 404 Filed 11/02/21 Page 3 of 6 
 I impartial in one kind of case, but for various reasons, related to their own life experiences or views, 
 2 can't be fair in another kind of case. The process that we use is designed to help us figure out 
 3 whether you can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. 
 4 If during the course of this process you come to believe that because of something that 
 5 you have experienced or because of something you've heard or read that you cannot be fair and 
 6 impartial—that is that you would favor either the Government or the Defendant regardless of 
 7 what the evidence shows—then you must tell me. It's not unusual, and there's no reason to be 
 8 embarrassed about it. 
 9 But the system only works if all of our citizens are willing and prepared to serve as jurors 
 to when they can do so fairly and impartially. I do not expect that anybody would seek to avoid this 
 it important duty for any but the most compelling reasons. 
 12 As I mentioned in my prior remarks, the Court has taken a number of steps to help ensure 
 13 the process for selected jurors is as safe and easy as possible. We have masking and distancing 
 14 protocols. We have reconfigured courtrooms to enhance safety measures. The Court will 
 15 provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the courthouse each day. Breakfast, 
 16 snacks, and lunch will be provided for you. 
 17 To conduct the next phase of the process, I will ask each of you some questions 
 18 individually. We'll do that in a separate courtroom where I and the lawyers and the Defendant 
 19 are sitting now. You all will be brought in the courtroom one at a time. Bear in mind that this is 
 20 a public courtroom. To protect your privacy, I will only refer to you by your juror number. 
 21 Please do not state any identifying information. For example, if we talk about your job you 
 22 could say that you are a sales clerk at a large retail store, without stating the specific name of 
 23 your employer. This is to protect your privacy. Even with those privacy protections in place, if 
 2 
 EFTA00030634
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 404 Filed 11/02/21 Page 4 of 6 
 I there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record, 
 2 please let me know. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue 
 3 to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process. 
 4 Now, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to 
 5 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to 
 6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind. 
 7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here now, she's presumed to be innocent. She is 
 8 presumed innocent until and only if the July finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 9 As I just explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just 
 to an accusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You 
 I I can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with 
 12 committing these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government 
 13 can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not 
 14 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on 
 15 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice. 
 16 The next thing is that as jurors you must follow the law as I give it to you, even if you 
 17 don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different. 
 18 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in 
 19 the newspapers or the intemet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in 
 20 discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on 
 21 something that you might have read or heard about another case. 
 22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not 
 23 permitted to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts 
 3 
 EFTA00030635
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 404 Filed 11/02/21 Page 5 of 6 
 I of this case at all. If you see something in the paper or online, you're just going to have to turn 
 2 the page or close the browser. You can't read it. 
 3 Equally important, you're not permitted to discuss this case with anyone else while the 
 4 case is going on. Even with your fellow jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard all 
 5 the evidence and I've given my instructions on the law. Again, that's because you can only 
 6 consider the evidence that you hear in the courtroom, not anything outside of the courtroom. You 
 7 have to keep an open mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your 
 8 jury service is complete. You can tell them that you are a juror in a criminal case in federal court 
 9 and that the judge has told you that you are not permitted to say anything further. 
 to Similarly, until you are excused from jury service, you cannot post anything about your 
 experience as a juror on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of social media. 
 12 Another instruction, you can't look up or google or do any other kind of search about anything 
 13 related to the case or anyone involved in the case. 
 14 The reason for these rules, as I am sure you understand, is they protect the integrity of the 
 is trial and assure that both sides receive a fair trial. 
 16 Jurors in criminal cases base their verdicts on the evidence that they hear in the 
 17 courtroom, not on something that somebody else tells you, not on something that you see on TV 
 Is or on social media. That's why if you're selected as a juror, I'll be reminding you of these rules 
 19 regularly. You can't watch news accounts, look anything up or speak to anybody else about the 
 20 case. You would be violating the oath you have taken as jurors and you would be violating my 
 21 orders if you were to do that. 
 22 Finally, you must report to me through my court deputy any effort by any person to speak 
 23 with you about the case or to influence you about the case or to get information about the case.

 I do want to thank all of you for the time you've invested already in this process. Our 
 2 system cannot function unless we have good people like you who are willing to give up their 
 3 time and to serve as jurors. 
 4 Please sit quietly until your number is called and you are brought into the courtroom for 
 5 questioning by me. Although you may use your electronic devices while you are waiting 
 6 (bearing in mind of course all of my instructions that forbid you to do any research or engage in 
 7 any communications about the case through any means), you must turn off and hand over any 
 8 electronic devices to the Jury Department staff before you are brought into the courtroom. I look 
 9 forward to meeting each of you in person soon. Thank you.

 Hey Chiefs, 
 They sent us the rest of their redline, if you'd like to take a look. 
 I've also attached a partial set of responses. I'll get you the rest ASAP tomorrow, but we're tight on timing, so here's about 
 half of it now. Two points about it: 
 1. I wasn't sure whether you wanted to see every change, so I've put comment bubbles even where I think we should 
 just accept the changes. 
 2. In their new redline as of tonight, they are proposing to do each count in order. We won't have time to implement 
 that by tomorrow, but we should think about whether to keep it as is or agree to their proposal. 
 This is due today (Wednesday), and the defense has significantly blow their deadline to get this to us. If it would help, we 
 can seek an extension on that basis. 
 Last, as you can see, they insist on putting our victims' names in filings. We are thinking of proposing to the defense that 
 they just note in a footnote their continued objection but stop using the names. Otherwise, we'd like to talk about going 
 to the Court. Their practice is (1) burdensome to make us redact all their filings, and (2) an invitation for us to miss 
 something and out a victim. 
 Thanks,

 Attached is the full redline of the RTCs. I made some changes to the sections I already sent you. Those are highlighted in 
 yellow. I will send you the verdict sheet later tonight. 
 Regarding the "Minor-Victim" terminology, I know the redactions are a pain, but it is still our position that there is no 
 need to anonymize them and we object to calling them both "minors" and "victims." So I can't agree to that. 
 Thanks,

 Hi Chris, 
 Just checking in on when you think you might have the rest of the RTC over to us. 
 Also, do you have any objection if we edit the places where your redline uses victim names to the "Minor Victim-X" 
 terminology? Our understanding is that we have to file this on ECF, and we just want to avoid having to redact anything. 
 Thanks,

 Counsel, 
 We're preparing a new version of the proposed redactions to the MILs that withdraw some of our proposals. Please let 
 us know which if any of your proposed redactions you would like to withdraw, and whether you would like to see our

 First, I wanted to send along the defense's expert disclosure for your review. We can discuss tomorrow. 
 On travel arrangements, I have consulted with others internally and can approve the purchase of a business class ticket if 
 nothing else is available. You should attach this email to your Amtrak tickets when you submit for reimbursement.

 Hello 
 Thank you - these rates are fine for the hotel, but in order to stay within the rate limit, I need to book a non-
 refundable rate. Please confirm the dates you would like me to be in NY next week as well as what dates you 
 anticipate working together for trial prep after the hearing (Thurs/Fri vs Fri/Sat). I need to move patients and would 
 like to know when to schedule them (either Thursday or Saturday). Finally, I will book myself on Amtrak, but for 
 many of the times, the only available options are business class seats - the coach seats are already sold out.

 I caught one of the officers who normally does SHU rec. He confirmed that can go to the roof for recreation. 
 SHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said is usually sleeping, and once he 
 eventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when and Epstein were housed together,

 The Facilities Manager told me they talked to He had no complaints about his cell. He only complained that 
 water leaked in his cell when people "took ion showers." Facilities ran the shower for awhile and didn't see the water 
 leaking down to cell, but if I give the benefit of the doubt, he may be correct that the water makes 
 its way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time. 
 Evening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave the three newspapers that arrived in the mail yesterday morning. 
 I think that's it for now. Let me know if you need anything else.

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYC024323 and NYC024324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYC024336 and NYC024337) 
 the following loose storage devices: 
 o Micro SD card (NYC024339) 
 o Flash Drive (generic) (NYC024340) 
 EFTA00030665
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
 o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
 o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
 The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
 The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
 match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
 might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
 thanks very much,

 Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
 unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
 convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
 size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
 file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
 in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an

 Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
 Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Subject: Re: Epstein search warrant documents 
 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
 back was lacking.

 Parvin, 
 That makes good sense, thanks. Because of the scheduling issues I mentioned, we'd like to set it for a time in early 
 September, if we can — is there a time during the afternoon of September 5 or the morning of September 6 that would 
 work for you? We should be able to do either of those dates and times. Or if not, we can propose possible times the 
 following week. 
 thank you,

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

 Like said in his earlier email. It will be the raw data and it will be marked so it is easier to attribute it to a

 In terms of data transfer, are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
 our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been

 make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 EFTA00030672
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
 clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
 they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
 search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
 transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
 mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
 and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
 was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
 able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
 on the rest.

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
 to schedule a productive meeting.

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 EFTA00030675
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
 modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 Initially, we propose that the lawyers (myself, my colleagues at Akin Gump, and someone from DB Legal) deliver a 
 presentation that provides an overview of Epstein's relationship with the bank, the different accounts affiliated with 
 Epstein and the types of transactions found in the accounts. We would also highlight various transactions that we have 
 noted in our internal investigation. Our aim is that the attorney proffer would help you in sifting through the records we 
 have provided so you can more readily identify whatever information you are most interested in. Following the proffer, if 
 there are particular accounts or transactions of interest, we can identify the person withir■who can best answer 
 questions on those areas and that person would then meet with you. 
 In terms of timing, I estimate 2-3 hours for the attorney proffer. (I think closer to 2 hours but I hate to underestimate.)

 Sure, and given that timing I actually think it would be helpful to schedule two meetings, so we can be on track to get

 And I would just add that because we do think she may have useful information for the ongoing investigation, which

Michael, 
 Wanted to get back to you, as promised — as we indicated previously, the attorney proffers we've received from you 
 haven't caused us to change our view of Ms. status, and I think you've generally addressed the initial and 
 follow-up questions we've had. I think from our perspective the next step would be to have a conversation with 
 Ms.= directly, and to cover with her the same topics that we've addressed with you. Ordinarily we would 
 approach a discussion like that simply by going chronologically, and asking follow-up questions as appropriate along 
 the way, but as I've mentioned to you previously, if it would be useful to proceed in a different format, or to focus 
 (or avoid) specific topics in a first meeting, I think we would generally be amenable to that. And of course as we've 
 also discussed, any discussion would be completely voluntary—not just the interview overall, but any specific topic 
 or question that she wanted to pass on, or discuss with you in the moment, etc., would be totally up to her. Please 
 let us know what you think? We're also happy to chat via phone if that would be helpful as well. 
 thanks,

 Received, thank you. This information is helpful, and as with the prior attorney proffer, does not cause us to

 We will be traveling most of this upcoming week, but I hope that we will be able to follow up with you the

 Following up on our meeting, one additional question / clarification we have from reviewing our notes is about 
 whether Ms ever visited certain Epstein properties other than his New York mansion and the brief visit to 
 the Palm Beach residence. I apologize if you addressed that and I missed it, but we wanted to add it to the list of 
 EFTA00030683
additional questions — in particular, whether she ever visited the New Mexico ranch, the Little St. James Island, 
 the Great St. James island, and/or the Paris residence. Also, is it correct that she just visited the Palm Beach 
 residence the one time you referenced? It's not a problem or issue if she visited any of those other locations, we 
 just wanted to clarify one way or the other. And happy to discuss via phone if that's useful.

 We do understand that your attorney proffer today will be preliminary, and to the best of your client's current 
 recollection and to the best of your current understanding, and without, e.g., having been provided documents or 
 other materials by the Government. 
 We also confirm that your statements will be considered to be made pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 410 and Fed. R. 
 Crim. P. 11(f), and therefore under those protections. Regarding Rule 408, we'll just note what we have for other 
 counsel in this case and others who have made similar statements or submissions, which is that we don't take any 
 position on the effect or application of Rule 408 in a prospective or hypothetical dispute in civil litigation, because 
 it doesn't implicate any rights the Government would or would not have, but you can consider us advised that 
 your position is that your statements are also covered under 408. (While our Office itself can't guarantee the 
 protections of Rule 408 because any dispute on that issue would be beyond our purview, we are also not taking 
 the position that we believe it does not apply.)

 Case Name: USA v. Maxwell 
 Case Number: I :20-cr-00330-AJN 
 Filer: 
 Document Number:92 
 Docket Text: 
 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC 
 legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 
 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal 
 counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden 
 Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's 
 conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, 
 along with the MDC legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's 
 request to summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves 
 Dkt. No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
 continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of 
 Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, 
 including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The 
 updates shall also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. The 
 Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 days. 
 Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant 
 continues to receive adequate access to. legal materials and her ability to communicate 
 with defense counsel. (Signed by Judge J. Nathan on 12/8/2020) (ap)

 Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
 connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request

 Thank you for this — it's extremely thorough and helpful, especially for an initial description, and we appreciate you 
 sending it so promptly. We also appreciate Ms. willingness to share this information with us, which is 
 obviously very personal but which meaningfully assists our investigation. 
 In the first instance, on an initial read, I wanted to advise that this information does not alter our view, which I also 
 conveyed via email on December 24, that we do not currently have reason to believe Ms. has criminal exposure 
 based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions with Epstein. Additionally, I do expect we likely will 
 have some follow-up queries; we'll circle back with you in more detail next week, but in the interim I wanted to 
 acknowledge receipt and thank you for conveying. We'll be in touch again soon.

 Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have 
 reason to believe Ms. has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions 
 with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with 
 that view. In your further discussions with Ms. in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general 
 nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns 
 about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I 
 believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to 
 further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely. 
 Please let us know if any other information would be useful at this stage, and hopefully we can be in touch in the coming 
 weeks about productive next steps.

 Mr. Bloxsome, 
 Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
 connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request 
 a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire about his 
 relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that have arisen 
 publicly and in our investigation to date. 
 Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law enforcement 
 channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has legal 
 representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance. 
 Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as a 
 threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch. 
 Regards, 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney 
 Southern District of New York

 To update you on the wire collection, we anticipate making a production next week. We are trying to confirm now, but we 
 believe that there are only five JPMC accounts — two for Epstein and three for Maxwell — for which there is wire data. 
 Separately, we also anticipate producing wire data for transactions related to Epstein, Maxwell, and where JPMC 
 acted as a correspondent bank. 
 We are also making progress on collecting other information, including account opening documents, KYC documents, and 
 account statements. Per our earlier conversations, we are compiling this information to make a single production rather 
 than providing it on a rolling basis. 
 Finally, we also understand that JPM National Subpoena Processing heard from at the FBI. We called him just 
 to say that to the extent he has questions, he can direct them to us. 
 Thanks, 
 Allison

 Anjan, 
 Thank you for checking in, and we look forward to receiving the update later this week. Regarding the subpoenas, I think 
 there was one subpoena served by the FBI just a day or two before we were first in touch, dated September 3, 2019, 
 relating to and then it appears we did inadvertently let the FBI serve one after we were in touch with 
 you, dated October 8, 2019, relating to . If you've received any subpoenas addition to those (other than the 
 ones we've already previously discussed), please let us know, and otherwise we certainly will send any additional process 
 directly to you—apologies for any inconvenience or confusion caused by the separate service. 
 Thanks again, and talk soon.

 Hope all is well. We expect to have an update for you later this week on the timing of the wire production and our other 
 ongoing collection efforts. On a related note, we learned from JPMorgan's National Subpoena Processing that they 
 received a couple subpoenas directly from the FBI, which I assume are related to the same investigation we've been 
 discussing. For any additional subpoenas in this investigation directed to JPMorgan, could you please direct them to us? 
 That will help us get them to the appropriate team more quickly.

 I did not see the signed SHU post orders. They should look like a series of rules and regulations for the post that are 
 signed by each officer. They are different from the daily rosters. And we should ask for the daily rosters for the time 
 period we are missing.

 I'm working though the outstanding requests, specifically those that we sent last week. 
 The Commissary Reports are in the shared here: 
 \usa.doj.gov\ clouanys \StAndrewASharealnReEpsteinDeath-2019R01059 \ Evidence Epstein General BOP Records 
 Additionally, the records for M, and (no or =) are here as well (in the same document). 
 However, all they entail is a single truview page and nothing else. The actual receipts are only for Epstein, M, and 
 Ruga rd. 
 What I'm not sure on is the signed SHU post order review sheets. I have looked through the files and can't seem to find 
 them anywhere. Albeit I don't know what they look like but I do think I would have recognized them. I will keep looking. 
 Lastly, are the post orders for SHU the same as the daily assignment roster? I've attached one of them as an example. If 
 so, we are missing several from the time period that we requested (7/1 — 8/10). 
 I'm going to continue to work through the spreadsheet as well.

 Hi Bruce, 
 MCC New York has permitted social visits despite disciplinary sanctions when the visit is specifically for mitigation 
 purposes. Disciplinary sanctions notwithstanding, all pretrial inmates have the same access to family communications: 
 monitored social visiting, monitored social phone calls, and monitored social mail. While I understand your client is a 
 death penalty case, there are many inmates at MCC with very complex cases who have legal decisions they need to 
 discuss with their families, and the methods available to them are the three methods I just mentioned. If a social 
 phone call is insufficient, then we will raise the issue again with administrators to see if they will allow a social visit 
 during your client's regular social visiting hours. However, please be advised that once your client returns to general 
 population with regular phone access, I do not anticipate administrators will be amenable to social visit requests unless 
 they are being used as mitigation evidence. 
 I am out of the office starting tomorrow, but Adam will let you know once he discusses it with Exec staff. 
 Thanks,

 I am sorry, but that won't be sufficient. We had a conversation with and a few weeks back and they 
 told us that, in light of the particular needs for preparation for a capital case, MCC would permit periodic social visits 
 as needed. I did not raise this issue with the court because of what we were told. Perhaps I misunderstood.

 Marty, 
 Following up on our conversation last week, are you able to share with us your thoughts on whether the defense 
 intends to address the Court beyond noting that there is no objection to the dismissal? 
 Separately, if you could please let us know the status of the return of discovery materials, we would appreciate it. 
 We are hopping to be able to tell the Court on Tuesday that this issue is resolved. 
 Thanks,

 I got your voicemail from this morning regarding follow-up on civil forfeiture—we have a meeting at 12:30 that I expect 
 will go approximately 15 minutes and will plan to give you (or Mike, to conference you in) a call after that, so 
 approximately around 12:45 — 1:00. 
 Separately, based on the expected nolle order, and in connection with the protective order in this case, in advance of the 
 hearing on Tuesday can you please either return to the Government all discovery you received in this case and certify 
 that any copies have been security destroyed or deleted, or, alternatively, simply certify that all discovery received has 
 been security destroyed or deleted? (As to the second option, that is to say that you do not need to make additional 
 copies of electronic materials to formally "return" them to us if it is more efficient to simply delete and destroy the 
 existing electronic copies you have.) We want to be able to advise the Court on Tuesday that there are no outstanding 
 discovery obligations on either side based in connection with the protective order.

 II. Review of ESI on the Subject Devices 
 Law enforcement personnel (who may include, in addition to law enforcement officers and 
 agents, attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the 
 government in this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) are 
 authorized to review the ESI contained on the Subject Device for evidence, fruits, and

 minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
 1. Evidence concerning the identity or location of the owner(s) or user(s) of the

Attachment A 
 I. Items Subject to Search and Seizure 
 The Subject Items are particularly described as follows': 
 a. Two blue binders with CDs, which were seized by Special Agent■ 
 from a blue suitcase on or about July 11, 2019 ("Subject Item-1"). 
 b. Three blue binders with various CDs and one clear binder with a green spine 
 with various CDs, all four of which were seized by Special Agent from a black 
 suitcase on or about July 11, 2019 ("Subject Item-2"). 
 II. Review of ESI on the Subject Items 
 Law enforcement personnel (who may include, in addition to law enforcement officers and 
 agents, attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the 
 government in this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) are 
 authorized to review the ESI contained on the Subject Items for evidence, fruits, and 
 instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of 
 minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
 1. Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims

 2. Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses; 
 3. Any nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
 appear to be teenage girls, or younger; 
 4. Records, data, or other items that evidence ownership, control, or use of, or access

 configuration files, saved usemames and passwords, user profiles, e-mail contacts, and 
 photographs; 
 5. Any child erotica, defined as suggestive visual depictions of nude minors that do 
 not constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). 
 ' To the extent that the Subject Items contain any removable storage media, including CDs, the 
 description of each such item encompasses those other media. 
 2017.08.02 
 EFTA00030743
In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to 
 determine which files or other ESI contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such 
 techniques may include, for example: 
 • surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to 
 looking at the outside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer 
 believed to contain pertinent files); 
 • conducting a file-by-file review by "opening" or reading the first few "pages" of such 
 files in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory 
 examination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its relevance); 
 • "scanning" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted data or 
 deliberately hidden files; and 
 • performing electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to 
 determine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of 
 the investigation; and 
 • reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry data, and any 
 other information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. 
 Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, 
 documents, or other electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section II 
 of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a complete 
 review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its contents and 
 to locate all data responsive to the warrant.

 Notice of Electronic Filing 
 The following transaction was entered on 12/8/2020 at 12:02 PM EST and filed on 12/8/2020 
 Case Name: USA v. Maxwell 
 Case Number: 1:20-cr-00330-AJN 
 Filer: 
 Document Number: 92 
 Docket Text: 
 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC 
 legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 
 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal 
 counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden 
 Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's 
 conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, 
 along with the MDC legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's 
 request to summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves 
 Dkt. No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
 continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of 
 Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, including 
 legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The updates shall 
 also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby 
 ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the 
 Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant continues to receive 
 adequate access to her legal materials and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
 (Signed by Judge J. Nathan on 12/8/2020) (ap)

 All, 
 I hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I 
 continue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me 
 know if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. 
 Many of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. 
 These issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I tried to include all policies that 
 reference those topics. 
 1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? 
 Executive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will 
 address this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. 
 2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive 
 to? Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and 
 this section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. 
 3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
 This policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I included the 
 policy because it directly correlated with other requests. 
 4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive 
 to? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you 
 requested. It is dated 1/2/2014. I have requested an updated version that would have been used 
 more closely to the time of assignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to 
 provide me whatever it is they used at that time. 
 5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our 
 requests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request 
 one from a time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the 
 Institutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It 
 is now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. 
 6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this 
 responsive to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of 
 quarterly SHU training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online 
 training platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The 
 official SHU training course is not something I can send or save due to the nature of the course 
 being automated by the training platform and not a hard file. 
 7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the 
 Standards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've 
 attached the DO) Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let 
 me know. 
 8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these 
 logs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I have worked at

places that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. 
 The LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for 
 review purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. 
 9. We were provided with a document called "SHU Logs MW" and a document called "SHU Logs." Can we confirm 
 what these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the 
 digital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time 
 period. I am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control 
 Center at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch 
 calls into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a — 6p each day. 
 10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as 
 having been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly 
 training requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. 
 11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request 
 incorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. 
 12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I am not aware of any such policy and 
 have struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I will continue to search 
 for a policy that references cellmate assignments. 
 13. In the second email, there is a document called "Hot Lists" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this 
 responsive to? The "Hot List" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires 
 immediate notification to Psychology. This is the only "high risk" list the BOP has and I provided it 
 in response to your request for "All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings..." 
 14. In the second email, Cody mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. 
 Do you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? 
 15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I continue to work from home, I have not 
 personally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I previously mentioned, 
 those logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I continue to follow up on this. 
 With regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are 
 currently in SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming 
 they were completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I am currently 
 trying to figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs 
 for the period of assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking 
 down inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number 
 of institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time 
 that are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with 
 all of the other documentation shortly after his death, but I have not confirmed that yet.

 As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing 
 information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon 
 as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been 
 hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on 
 those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily 
 frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

If you are in the "to" line of this email, you have a Project Safe Childhood case for which we need an update. Because of 
 the sensitive nature of these cases, it's critical that we don't let cases linger, and, in consultation with your supervisors, we

 Please review the attached list, noting the most recent entry for any case under your name. Then... 
 • If the case is uncharged, please advise me of the status of any expected charges and/or come by to discuss next 
 steps. 
 • If the case has been charged, please send me a quick email with any updates to the case status (e.g., pled, 
 sentenced, on appeal) or, if the status is up to date, please confirm that no changes need to be made. 
 Thanks in advance for your prompt reply to this email. (Read: Please don't make me hunt you down for updates — this will

 Subject: DO.1 ongoing Investigation. 
 Dear 
 ; Jennifer Richardson O; 
 We and the Duke of York set out to assist your investigation when the DOJ asked for his help in January 2020. 
 However, we regret to say that we have reached the conclusion that the DOJ's dealings with the Duke of York 
 have not been designed to seek his assistance in investigating and prosecuting the targets of the investigation but 
 instead have been used only to gather publicity for Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the 
 Southern District of New York. 
 EFTA00030799
It is essential, if justice is to be done for Epstein's victims, that a proper and thorough criminal investigation is 
 carried out. Although the public record indicates your office (SDNY) has been actively investigating Mr. Epstein 
 and other targets for more than 2 years, the first time you ever attempted to make contact and request The Duke 
 of York's help was on 2 January 2020. 
 The Duke instructed my firm to make contact with you pertaining to this request. When we made contact, you 
 confirmed that the Duke of York was not and is not a target of the US criminal investigation. 
 Due to the publicity surrounding the investigation, we asked you to confirm that our discussions and any 
 interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with your rules. The Duke did not want to add 
 to the media circus that has now surrounded the investigation. On 10 January 2020 you confirmed 
 that any arrangements would indeed be kept confidential. 
 We indicated that we would refer back to you once we had dealt with the various issues and procedures, which 
 would need to be addressed to enable the Duke to cooperate to the fullest extent possible, including the need to 
 obtain all the information that you might need to consider. It was at that time that we informed you, by email 
 dated 20 January, that such preliminary issues would be dealt with within 14 days. It was also in that email that 
 we confirmed that The Duke has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
 Instead of waiting to hear from us (as you indicated on 22 January 2020), Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United 
 States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, chose to make a public statement about the Duke on 27 
 January 2020. This led to press reports that there had been "a wall of silence" and that there had been "zero co-
 operation" by the Duke. These statements were not true. They should not have been made. 
 Quite apart from your promise of confidentiality, in England it would not be thought to be in the interests of 
 justice for any prosecutor or investigator to make public statements about witnesses who may be willing, in 
 confidence, to assist their investigation. 
 In England, prosecutors and investigators try to make sure that the investigation and trial of serious criminal 
 cases take place in court and not in press conferences or publicity battles. 
 When we complained about the way the Duke (and we) had been treated by the DOJ, you refused to 
 apologise and you have now also gone back on your promise that any arrangements for the interview will be 
 confidential. 
 We cannot advise the Duke to speak to prosecutors who cannot be trusted to deal with him fairly nor to treat 
 what he says or does confidentially. He has reluctantly accepted our advice that, in those circumstances, there is 
 no purpose to be served in continuing to try to assist further. 
 Finally we have no wish to engage in any further publicity battle about the DOJ's conduct and for that reason we 
 ask that you treat this email as private and confidential. 
 Regards 
 Gary

 I am not sure if this would be helpful to you but we just got in a FOIA response request this week and it shows Maxwell on 
 a notarized 1994 documents swearing she is a "disinterested" party and issuing an appraisal for certain of Epstein's New

 These are great. Keeping in mind that we may have sensitivities about this exact wording, here's a humbly 
 suggested pull quote: 
 "Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't a bystander. And she wasn't just an enabler. She was a participant." 
 I think with the right inflection this could be powerful. Just a thought...

I. MS. RICHARDSON'S COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE 
 While incarcerated, Ms. Richardson, unsolicited, has provided important assistance to the 
 Government on various investigations and prosecutions. Although she herself cannot file a motion 
 for a sentencing reduction under Rule 35, all of the Assistant United States Attorneys with whom 
 Ms. Richardson has met or to whom she has offered information welcomed her assistance, even 
 where her testimony at trial was not ultimately required. 
 are described below. 
 Examples of Ms. Richardson's assistance 
 C. Ms. Richardson Provided Information to the Government Regarding Jeffrey 
 Epstein's Death. 
 Given that Ms. Richardson has been a prisoner at the MCC since her arrest in 2016, she 
 has relationships with guards and inmates who often share invaluable information concerning 
 events at the MCC. When Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019, Ms. Richardson heard helpful 
 information concerning the circumstances surrounding his death and requested that counsel 
 provide such details (such as the names of the guards on duty at his time of death, their actions in 
 response to his hanging, and which cameras to check for potentially helpful footage) to the 
 Government. The Government expressed appreciation for the information, followed up with Ms. 
 Richardson through counsel to confirm additional details and, although it did not request her 
 testimony or an in-person proffer, we note that many of the details Ms. Richardson provided were 
 reflected in various charging documents.

 Attached is a quick (rough!) draft. I didn't really edit the rider, except to add a few bullet points as reminders, because I 
 am not sure what the scope of the search we are seeking is. Can you guys review and take a crack at it? FBI has asked us 
 to do this quickly, so if we could all focus on this for the moment, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

 As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing 
 information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as 
 possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours 
 since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those 
 basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily 
 frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise. 
 Thank you,

 Re: United States v. Jeffrey  Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
 Dear Judge Pitman: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
 for July 8, 2019, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
 order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
 presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
 appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
 As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
 alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
 and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
 evidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the substantial 
 incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of 
 fl ight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and access to private 
 planes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of 
 the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned 
 from a multi-week stay abroad. 
 Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
 experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant could attempt 
 to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
 their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
 to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. 
 The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
 case, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.

 BACKGROUND 
 A. Overview 
 On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
 indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
 in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
 in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
 As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
 a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the 
 defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he 
 paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
 He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
 Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
 "Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
 similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which 
 would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
 would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
 victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
 encounter. 
 Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
 girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
 these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this 
 fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
 including New York and Palm Beach. 
 The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his 
 victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant 
 intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his 
 victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
 them. 
 In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
 worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
 by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
 defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
 B. The Defendant 
 Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
 and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
 rampant abuse of underage girls.

 As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
 maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
 Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a 
 private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
 residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
 reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
 school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million. 
 Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one 
 of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
 As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
 and his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to 
 maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
 defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately 
 more than 20 occasions. 
 C. The Prior Florida Investigation 
 In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
 connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The 
 investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
 the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") and the FBI's Miami Office, and included interviews 
 with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
 One of the instant Indictment.' 
 In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
 connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
 identified as including investigations into the defendant's abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
 area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
 was never charged federally.2 In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
 of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
 of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
 registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
 The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
 the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida. 
 As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
 were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
 2 While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
 Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
 not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney's 
 Office in another district. See page 6, infra.

 ARGUMENT 
 I. Applicable Law 
 Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
 order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
 danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ("no condition or combination of 
 conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
 other person and the community"). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
 preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 
 United States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must 
 be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 
 542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if 
 there is "a serious risk that the [defendant] will. . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . to threaten, 
 injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2)(B); see also United 
 States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
 The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
 nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
 (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
 financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
 entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
 see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
 to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
 Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
 Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
 other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
 trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
 committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
 subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
 appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3142(e)(3)(E). 
 Il. Discussion 
 The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is 
 difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
 and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
 detention in this case.

 A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
 Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances 
 of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
 counsel strongly in favor of detention. 
 I. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
 The "nature and circumstances" of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3I42(g)( I ) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
 factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
 defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
 community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant's 
 conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims. 
 The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
 include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.3 As the Second 
 Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
 fl ight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 
 2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the seriousness of the charges against her 
 gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) 
 ("Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even 
 greater incentive to consider flight."). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades 
 in prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has 
 in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear. 
 It is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real 
 prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted. 
 The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
 evidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges 
 that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
 numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant's crimes.4
 3 The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
 sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006. 
 The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
 therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. 
 4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
 Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
 crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. ("Were an 
 evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in 
 which an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering 
 that which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of 
 EFTA00030836
Honorable Henry Pitman 
 United States Magistrate Judge

 Page 6 
 Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
 against the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
 by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
 further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
 defendant's arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
 young women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials, 
 such as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant's residence that include 
 names and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and 
 his agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply, 
 all of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually 
 abused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be 
 devastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
 Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant's previous non-
 prosecution agreement ("NPA") with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
 conviction. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
 which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
 date of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v. 
 Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute 
 of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still 
 running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 
 WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
 Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
 York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
 investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
 prosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
 that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
 another." United States v. Frisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds 
 only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
 affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.") (citing United States 
 v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the 
 agreement purports to bind "the Government." See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This analysis 
 similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
 854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
 to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
 Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
 which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
 affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 
 771 F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
 the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
 detained.").

 conduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims 
 identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of 
 whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment. 
 Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
 the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
 described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
 2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
 The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The 
 defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
 to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless. 
 As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
 registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
 private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
 Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant's New York City mansion 
 alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant's Palm Beach 
 estate is more than $12 million. The defendant's primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
 Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible. 
 Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration 
 documentation of "current vehicles" lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
 Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
 and a Hummer II. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
 Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
 giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment's notice and to go virtually 
 anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
 and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
 present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
 Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
 arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
 abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of 
 fl ight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be 
 no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
 Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The 
 defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends 
 and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
 professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
 defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
 in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
 Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
 defendant's presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would 
 EFTA00030838
Honorable Henry Pitman 
 United States Magistrate Judge 
 July 8, 2019 
 Page 8 
 merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application 
 for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing 
 defendant's head start"); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
 at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
 Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
 Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
 dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
 his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
 reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
 this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
 in conjunction with the strength of the government's case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
 could receive if convicted. 
 B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
 Obstruction of Justice 
 The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
 community and to the ongoing investigation. 
 As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
 committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
 conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not 
 only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
 previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in 
 June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
 age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under 
 classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a "high" risk of committing another 
 sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
 2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
 Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant's offense in Florida, 
 there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
 other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
 discussions between prosecutors and the defendant's then-counsel about the possibility of the 
 defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to "obstruction," as well as "harassment," with 
 reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes "[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or 
 informant." For example, in a communication from the defendant's then-counsel to prosecutors 
 in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant 
 had "attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
 official proceeding" and that the defendant "in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
 [redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
 attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]" and "further verbally 
 EFTA00030839
Honorable Henry Pitman 
 United States Magistrate Judge 
 July 8, 2019 
 Page 9 
 harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
 all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1)."5 Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
 361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
 that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
 of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant's then-
 counsel replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed 
 a possible obstruction plea that "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private 
 investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road." Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
 The defendant's apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
 tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that "forc[edl off the road" the father of an 
 individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court's 
 consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
 being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government's 
 case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed 
 above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
 Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
 victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
 women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
 his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
 discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
 mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at 
 least hundreds—and perhaps thousands-of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
 nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
 of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
 who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. 
 Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which 
 law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the 
 following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude." The defendant, a 
 registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;6 rather, he is a 
 continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting 
 deeply serious charges.

 yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip 
 Weiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too 
 close to the sun,' I said. `Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked.").

 CONCLUSION 
 As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The 
 defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
 offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years' imprisonment—even a fraction 
 of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In 
 sum, the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
 international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
 ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
 successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
 dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
 intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
 dangerousness readily apparent. 
 Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not 
 be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there 
 are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court proceedings in this 
 case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied. 
 Very truly yours,

 Good morning Bobbi: 
 While I understand the mail you have sent is time sensitive, there are 
 BOP policies that must be complied with. All mail must be processed in 
 a particular manner prior to being provided to an inmate. The legal 
 department is not involved in the processing of mail for any inmates in 
 Institution. The institution is not allowing visitors, therefore the 
 mail may not be hand delivered, but again, the mail must be properly 
 processed before provided to the inmate. Unfortunately, this is not 
 something I can assist with. 
 >> > BOBBI C STERNHEIM <1/20/2021 1:27 PM >» 
 Ms. Maxwell needs to review time-sensitive documents for filing on 
 Monday 1/25. 
 It appears that overnight express mail is not received next day and 
 delivery to Ms.Maxwell is further delayed. 
 Please let me know if we can hand-deliver legal mail for Ms. Maxwell to 
 the MDC for direct deposit in the legal mail box. 
 If so, can delivery to Ms. Maxwell be expedited? 
 Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

 Thanks so much, M, and my apologies for the delayed response. I've been traveling for work and fell behind on emails 
 as a result. I will email defense counsel to ask them to send a link where they'd like the materials uploaded.

 can upload these files for defense counsel today and will be able to load a disc for Maxwell when I'm back at the office 
 tomorrow. I recall that the last time we produced to defense in this manner they preferred to use their FTP site. Would 
 you mind asking them to send over a link to where they'd like the materials uploaded? Thanks!

 Thanks so much! Once you have the renumbered files, would you please prepare them for production to the defense? 
 Ideally, they could go on a disc for Maxwell and USAfx for defense counsel, but let me know if it's too large.

 6b and 6c will require us to check the drives that we have at the office. Neither nor I will be at the office today or 
 tomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to 
 conclusions but I believe that PAE's .DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the 
 appearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they 
 list them although we will not know until we actually check the productions.

 We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
 convenience. 
 EFTA00030862
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
 production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
 Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
 will be ready? 
 2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
 MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
 include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
 30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
 a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
 can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
 the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
 require to facilitate this production. 
 3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
 not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
 Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD016." We do 
 not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
 numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
 documents were recovered. 
 4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
 bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
 identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
 5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
 (SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
 the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
 Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
 explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
 removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
 6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
 a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
 SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
 range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
 b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
 file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNYGM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
 We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
 November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
 defense. 
 8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
 government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
 There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
 for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
 the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
 EFTA00030863
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
 the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
 criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

 further interviews or other fact-finding, they will be in touch with us before doing so. But it may make sense to have a

 On the report, we can chat when is back tomorrow — but when you say start the report, do you just mean start

 Any sense of timing?

At the request of defense counsel, our office is preparing a new drive with a copy of discovery material that was 
 previously produced to Ghislaine Maxwell on a CD, but which she has been unable to view. The drive will be 
 ready tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming 
 weekend, but no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that 
 Maxwell would not receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to 
 pick the drive up from our office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. 
 Would that be permissible?

 By way of further update, I spoke with from OIG today. They had a conference call with Inspector 
 General this morning, who dictated that they start the report on the case. The report will include 
 everything from the time of Epstein's admission to the MCC up to the time of his death. in DC is the 
 attorney assigned to the report. The first issue under examination is why Epstein was not given a new cellmate 
 following Reyes's departure—a draft of this section of the report is expected to be completed by the end of this week. 
 They will be starting with the materials from the criminal investigation. If they need to do additional fact finding, they 
 will be in touch with us before doing so. There is no deadline yet for the completion of the report, which will likely 
 become public. 
 It likely makes sense to have a brief discussion. In the email below, OIG requested our position on the investigation, but

 Should the Board come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent

 6b and 6c will require us to check the drives that we have at the office. Neither nor I will be at the office today or 
 tomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to 
 conclusions but I believe that .DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the 
 appearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they 
 list them although we will not know until we actually check the productions. 
 Thanks,

 We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
 convenience. 
 1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
 production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
 Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
 will be ready? 
 2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
 MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
 include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
 30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
 a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
 can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
 the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
 require to facilitate this production. 
 3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
 not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
 Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
 not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
 numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
 documents were recovered. 
 4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
 bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
 identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
 5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
 (SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
 the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
 Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
 explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
 removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
 6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
 a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
 SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
 range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
 EFTA00030890
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
 file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
 We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
 November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
 defense. 
 8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
 government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
 There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
 for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-
 the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
 in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
 the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
 criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

 Her recollection is that two photos of her were taken while she was topless. Obviously, copies of those photos

 Following up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the 
 thumb drive I received from yesterday with CART materials, NYC027913 is not included, so we are still missing that 
 one. 
 But I do see that each of the items with the "Included next round" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, with 
 those items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. 
 In terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a 
 handful of them (approximately seven total, I think) — do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials 
 for any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? 
 And then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted in 
 gray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery.

 I am pretty sure NYC027913 is included with the items has. If not, please let me know. 
 As far as the old questions, you should have everything now. 
 The zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the

 I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such 
 files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be 
 comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items 
 in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to get 
 them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not 
 be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me know.

 Thanks for sending, M. I agree with this approach, though defer to if she's handling, and thanks in advance. On 
 the last point: I do think we have a firm view that they should not be filing our discovery materials in civil cases. I don't 
 care about the substance of these particular documents, but I think we agree that is an important aspect of the protective

 I think is particularly swamped this week—can you please take the lead on whatever we're going to do with this 
 (i.e., presumably whatever the chiefs decide)? My personal vote would be to tell them that the protective order explicitly 
 precludes the use of criminal grand jury materials in Maxwell's civil cases, and the materials are sealed because they 
 relate to an ongoing grand jury investigation and they should feel free to raise the issue with Nathan and we'll respond. 
 (And I would think our response could basically be a copy-paste of the letter I wrote to Netburn.) We could also note in 
 our response to Jeff and Laura, if we wanted to, that given their awareness of the materials, we assume they will retract 
 the obviously false claims about government malfeasance. 
 All that said, I also wouldn't object if they just want to allow them to file these materials under seal; I don't think it 
 matters hugely. If we could have resolved (et al) by now, none of this would be an issue.

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Mr. Pagliuca: 
 The Government writes in response to your letter dated August 9, 2020 requesting to use 
 discovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case bearing 
 Bates Nos. SDNY GM _ 00000834 through SDNY_ GM_ 00000962 (the "Unsealing Materials") to _ 
 litigate a civil lawsuit. 
 As an initial matter, the Government notes that it remains unclear whether you make this 
 request in your capacity as defense counsel to Ms. Maxwell in the above-referenced criminal case, 
 or in your capacity as her attorney in a separate civil matter. If the former, the Government 
 maintains that the "Confidential" designation of the Unsealing Materials is appropriate because 
 Chief Judge Colleen McMahon and Magistrate Judge Sarah Netbum have ordered that the 
 Unsealing Materials remain under seal. The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the 
 production of Chief Judge McMahon's April 9, 2019 Order (Bates Nos. SDNY_GM_00000904 
 through SDNY_GM_00000905) to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, and production of the entirety 
 of the Unsealing Materials to Ms. Maxwell as discovery in the above-referenced criminal case. 
 The Unsealing Materials relate to an ongoing criminal investigation, and their public disclosure at 
 this stage risks interference with that investigation. Moreover, the Protective Order issued by 
 Judge Alison J. Nathan in the above-referenced criminal case expressly provides that any and all 
 discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of designation, 
 "[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this 
 criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this 
 action." (Protective Order, ECF No. 36, dated July 30, 2020, ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a)). The 
 Government notes that counsel for Ms. Maxwell expressly consented to that limitation when 
 negotiating the Protective Order in the criminal case. Accordingly, regardless of designation, the 
 Protective Order expressly prohibits use of any discovery materials produced by the Government 
 in the above-referenced criminal case in any civil case. 
 EFTA00030904
Page 2 
 To the extent you make this request in your capacity as counsel to Ms. Maxwell in civil 
 litigation, you are welcome to avail yourself of requests for records through the Freedom of 
 Information Act or through a Toughy request, in the same manner as any other litigant seeking to 
 use records from a federal criminal investigation in a civil case. If you wish to make such a request, 
 the undersigned can refer you to the appropriate Assistant United States Attorney in our office's

 Can I make a small suggestion on this? Unless and until it gets super inconvenient to do this in terms of upload time, I'd 
 suggest putting *all* the current discovery on whatever disk we send to the prison, like USAO_GM_000001 through 
 whatever is the latest production, and then having the facility send back whatever is the last disc we sent after the new 
 one arrives. 
 That way at any time there are only two disks out in the world with her discovery on them (the one she has at any given 
 time, and the one that's on its way to replace it), and only one in her possession at all times. Otherwise in two months 
 she's going to have a half dozen hard drives sitting in the MDC, with all different stuff on each one. But per usual anybody 
 should weigh in if anyone disagrees!

A new lawsuit significantly expanded the scope of wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have 
 engaged.Credit...New York State Sex Offender Registry, via Associated Press 
 By Ali Watkins 
 Jan. 15, 2020Updated 2:41 p.m. ET 
 New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and 
 girls on his private Caribbean island, some as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of his 
 alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls as 
 young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, and kept a 
 computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the lawsuit said. 
 The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise N. George, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, 
 broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have engaged. He had 
 been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in 
 New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005. 
 In August, Mr. Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being 
 held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prison guards had not checked on 
 him for hours on the night he died, and the circumstances surrounding his death are now the subject 
 of at least three federal investigations.
 In the weeks before Mr. Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal 
 charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in Florida 
 for solicitation. 
 The suit was filed against Mr. Epstein's estate and seeks the forfeiture of Little Saint James and Mr. 
 Epstein's second private island, Great Saint James, as well as the dissolution of numerous shell

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 81 Filed 12/03/20 Par" 1 rtf 9 
 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 United States of America, 
 —v—
 Ghislaine Maxwell, 
 Defendant. 
 USDC SONY 
 DOCUMENT 
 ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
 DOC  
 DATE FILED: 12/3/20 
 20-CR-330 (MN) 
 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request 
 seeking an in camera conference for the presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and 
 a request to seal the November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for 
 the sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no longer 
 fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and instead proposing 
 redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters. The Government has 
 indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80. 
 After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions, which 
 are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the three-part test 
 articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 
 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are 
 "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the 
 materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 
 119-20. "Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to `the danger of impairing law 
 enforcement or judicial efficiency' and `the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.' Id. 
 at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Anrodeo II")). 
 EFTA00030910
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 81 Filed 12/03/20 Page 2 of 2 
 The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's letter 
 motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
 process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the 
 Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo 1"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And 
 while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of access attaches, in balancing 
 competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments 
 the Defendant has put forth—including, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals 
 referenced in the letters-favor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby 
 ORDERED to docket the redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. 
 For the reasons outlined in the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, 
 the Court DENIES the Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the 
 privacy interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit 
 the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored redactions. 
 The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly prepare a briefing 
 schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for release on bail. 
 SO ORDERED.

Chris, 
 Following up on point 6 below, our paralegals have re-stamped the materials you identified with a Bates range overlap 
 and are prepared to reproduce those materials to you. The materials are small enough to produce via your FTP site. 
 Would you like to send us a link to where you would like those materials uploaded? Alternatively, we can load the

 We are still waiting to hear back from our vendor about the remaining issues you identified in point 6.

 Subject: RE: Discovery Requests 
 Chris, 
 Below please find our responses. 
 1. As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has access to the 4TB drive containing a full set of the discovery 
 produced to date. It took a significant amount of time to create this copy due to the volume of discovery and 
 delays on the part of our vendor, who assisted in creating the copy. 
 2. As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has a drive containing the contents of the CD produced on 
 November 18, 2020. 
 3. As I conveyed to you over the phone and in a recent email, the materials produced from the Subject Devices all 
 contain metadata indicating the "NYC" CART Evidence Number of the device from which each document was 
 extracted. In our November 18, 2020 discovery letter, we provided you with a chart setting forth which "NYC" 
 CART Evidence Number corresponds with which Subject Device in our warrants. If you still need a detailed index 
 of all 1.2 million documents with the specific Subject Device indicated, please let me know, and I will ask one of 
 our paralegals to compile one. 
 4. We produced the FBI report bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 in the form in which it was 
 recovered from one of Epstein's devices. In other words, we did not apply any redactions to that document; 
 rather, the redactions existed on the document at the time the document was found during the FBI's search of 
 Epstein's devices. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for a log of redactions. If you have any 
 EFTA00030914
legal authority on that point, we would be happy to consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that our office did not 
 apply redactions to any material that was identified responsive during the searches of Epstein's devices. 
 5. We are aware of our discovery obligations, have complied with them, and will continue to comply with them. We 
 are not aware of any legal basis for your request that we inform you of what, if any, documents have been 
 withheld or the basis for their withholding. If you have any legal authority on that point, we would be happy to 
 consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that we have provided you with all records we received from AT&T and all 
 records we received from David Rodgers. As to your inquiry about the Bates ranges on the Rodgers documents 
 beginning with Bates number "28", I note that the folder containing the Rodgers subpoena returns in our August 
 5, 2020 production included two documents. The first (SDNY_GM_00005532-5649) is the document you 
 referenced in your email inquiry. The second (SDNY_GM_00005650-5676) is 27 pages long, accounting for the 
 first 27 pages of the production from Rodgers. We produced those two documents in the form in which we 
 received them. 
 6. Our paralegals are working on the issues you identified with Bates ranges and metadata load files. I will reach 
 back out to you once I have an update on the status of those issues. 
 7. We do not have a more detailed index of the November 9 and November 18 productions beyond what we have 
 provided to you. 
 8. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for copies of grand jury subpoenas. Nor are we aware of any 
 legal basis for your request that we identify the date range of documents we requested in each subpoena. If you 
 have any legal authority for those requests, we would be happy to consider it. 
 9. The court filings that appear to be referenced in the Daily Beast article you sent are an application for a search 
 warrant and a search warrant filed in the District of New Hampshire. We produced both documents to you in 
 discovery on August 5, 2020. The DNH judge issued a sealing order in connection with the warrant and 
 application. As you can see at Bates No. SDNY_GM_00000621, the sealing order automatically expired on 
 December 30, 2020. Our understanding is that the District of New Hampshire unsealed the filing of its own 
 accord in conformity with the clear language of that sealing order. Our office took no affirmative steps to unseal 
 or otherwise release these filings.

We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
 convenience. 
 1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
 production. We provided you with a 4T8 hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
 Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
 will be ready? 
 2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
 MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
 include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
 30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
 a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
 can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
 the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
 require to facilitate this production. 
 3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
 not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
 Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
 not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
 numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
 documents were recovered. 
 4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
 bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
 identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
 5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
 (SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
 the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
 Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
 explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
 removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
 6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
 a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
 SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
 range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY GM 00328070-328863). 
 b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
 file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNYGM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
 We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
 November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
 defense. 
 8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
 government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
 EFTA00030916
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
 for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
 the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
 in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
 the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
 criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

companies he established in the territory that officials have said acted as fronts for his sex trafficking 
 enterprise. 
 As part of its policies, the government of the Virgin Islands could take any assets recovered from Mr. 
 Epstein's estate and consider disbursing them to women and girls who were victimized by him in the 
 region, Ms. George said. 
 The new accusations — which draw both from independent investigations by Ms. George's office and 
 court documents from cases across the country — argue that Mr. Epstein ran a decades-long sex 
 trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.

 I can upload these files for defense counsel today and will be able to load a disc for Maxwell when I'm back at the office 
 tomorrow. I recall that the last time we produced to defense in this manner they preferred to use their FTP site. Would 
 you mind asking them to send over a link to where they'd like the materials uploaded? Thanks!

 Thanks so much! Once you have the renumbered files, would you please prepare them for production to the defense? 
 Ideally, they could go on a disc for Maxwell and USAfx for defense counsel, but let me know if it's too large.

 Hey 
 We will take care of 6a today. 
 (USANYS) 
 6b and 6c will require us to check the drives that we have at the office. Neither nor I will be at the office today or 
 tomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to 
 conclusions but I believe that PAE's .DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the 
 appearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they 
 list them although we will not know until we actually check the productions. 
 Thanks,

 We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
 convenience. 
 1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
 production. We provided you with a 4T8 hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
 Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
 will be ready? 
 2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
 MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
 include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
 30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
 a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
 EFTA00030920
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
 the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
 require to facilitate this production. 
 3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
 not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
 Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
 not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
 numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
 documents were recovered. 
 4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
 bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
 identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
 5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
 (SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
 the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
 Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
 explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
 removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
 6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
 a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
 SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
 range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
 b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
 file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
 We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
 November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
 defense. 
 8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
 government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
 There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
 for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-
 the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
 in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
 the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
 criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

 Our paralegals reminded me that we have produced the ranges you included in your most recent email twice: once in the 
 third production (08-21-2020) and once in the reproduction with shortened file names (09-03-2020). We can certainly 
 produce them a third time, but we would not be able to reproduce them again through your FTP link, as they are too 
 large. Please provide us with a 64 GB drive if you would like us to reproduce those ranges.

 Below please find our responses. 
 1. As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has access to the 4TB drive containing a full set of the discovery 
 produced to date. It took a significant amount of time to create this copy due to the volume of discovery and 
 delays on the part of our vendor, who assisted in creating the copy. 
 2. As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has a drive containing the contents of the CD produced on 
 November 18, 2020. 
 3. As I conveyed to you over the phone and in a recent email, the materials produced from the Subject Devices all 
 contain metadata indicating the "NYC" CART Evidence Number of the device from which each document was 
 extracted. In our November 18, 2020 discovery letter, we provided you with a chart setting forth which "NYC" 
 CART Evidence Number corresponds with which Subject Device in our warrants. If you still need a detailed index 
 of all 1.2 million documents with the specific Subject Device indicated, please let me know, and I will ask one of 
 our paralegals to compile one. 
 4. We produced the FBI report bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 in the form in which it was 
 recovered from one of Epstein's devices. In other words, we did not apply any redactions to that document; 
 rather, the redactions existed on the document at the time the document was found during the FBI's search of 
 Epstein's devices. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for a log of redactions. If you have any 
 legal authority on that point, we would be happy to consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that our office did not 
 apply redactions to any material that was identified responsive during the searches of Epstein's devices. 
 5. We are aware of our discovery obligations, have complied with them, and will continue to comply with them. We 
 are not aware of any legal basis for your request that we inform you of what, if any, documents have been 
 withheld or the basis for their withholding. If you have any legal authority on that point, we would be happy to 
 consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that we have provided you with all records we received from and all 
 records we received from . As to your inquiry about the Bates ranges on the documents 
 beginning with Bates number "28', I note that the folder containing the subpoena returns in our August 
 5, 2020 production included two documents. The first (SDNY_GM_00005532-5649) is the document you 
 referenced in your email inquiry. The second (SDNY_GM_00005650-5676) is 27 pages long, accounting for the 
 first 27 pages of the production from . We produced those two documents in the form in which we 
 received them. 
 6. Our paralegals are working on the issues you identified with Bates ranges and metadata load files. I will reach 
 back out to you once I have an update on the status of those issues. 
 7. We do not have a more detailed index of the November 9 and November 18 productions beyond what we have 
 provided to you. 
 8. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for copies of grand jury subpoenas. Nor are we aware of any 
 legal basis for your request that we identify the date range of documents we requested in each subpoena. If you 
 have any legal authority for those requests, we would be happy to consider it. 
 9. The court filings that appear to be referenced in the Daily Beast article you sent are an application for a search 
 warrant and a search warrant filed in the District of New Hampshire. We produced both documents to you in 
 discovery on August 5, 2020. The DNH judge issued a sealing order in connection with the warrant and 
 EFTA00030930
application. As you can see at Bates No. SDNY_GM_00000621, the sealing order automatically expired on 
 December 30, 2020. Our understanding is that the District of New Hampshire unsealed the filing of its own 
 accord in conformity with the clear language of that sealing order. Our office took no affirmative steps to unseal 
 or otherwise release these filings.

 We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
 convenience. 
 1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
 production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
 Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
 will be ready? 
 2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
 MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
 include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
 30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto

 can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
 the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
 require to facilitate this production. 
 3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
 not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
 Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
 not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
 numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
 documents were recovered. 
 4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
 bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
 EFTA00030931
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
 5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the documents 
 (SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
 the flight logs produced by begin at Bates number suggesting that 
 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
 explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
 removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
 6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
 a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
 SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
 range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
 b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
 file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
 We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
 7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
 November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
 defense. 
 8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
 government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
 There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
 for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
 the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
 in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
 the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
 criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

 On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we hereby request that the government file a 
 Bill of Particulars pursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Please let us 
 know by January 4, 2021 whether it will be necessary to raise any aspect of this request with the 
 Court.

 to prepare her defense and avoid unfair surprise at trial. See United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 
 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). The Superseding Indictment does not sufficiently inform Ms. Maxwell of 
 the specific conduct of which she is accused. Accordingly, we request the following particulars

"Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint 
 James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here," Ms. George said. 
 The suit underscores the legal complications of reckoning with such wide-reaching crimes as those Mr. 
 Epstein is said to have committed. Ms. George's suit is the first filed against the estate by a government 
 entity, but it joins a field of similar claims filed by more than a dozen women. 
 It remains unclear how Mr. Epstein's assets, which are valued at about $500 million, could be 
 allocated. 
 "We don't have a long history of figuring out what to do in cases of human trafficking," said Bridgette 
 Carr, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, who 
 consulted with Ms. George's team on the case. "I think this litigation and the courts are just trying to 
 come up with the best, imperfect solution." 
 Mr. Epstein's executor, Darren K. Indyke, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
 Ms. George said she believed the case could chip away at the region's reputation as a notorious haven 
 for the rich and powerful. 
 "We will not remain complacent, and we will enforce our laws whatever way we can," Ms. George said. 
 "It doesn't matter the social status of the person. It's that the laws apply equally."

 The court documents said that Mr. Epstein operated with impunity for years at Little Saint James and 
 Great Saint James, which he obtained through a straw purchaser in 2016. 
 As recently as July 2018, Mr. Epstein refused to permit an investigator from the Virgin Island's 
 Department of Justice to enter Little Saint James, claiming the island's dock was his "front door," 
 according to the lawsuit. The investigator was doing routine monitoring of Mr. Epstein because he was 
 a registered sex offender. 
 Mr. Epstein's victims included aspiring models from South America, according to court documents.

 Emne: Epstein case 
 Dear 
 I'm an investigative reporter at The Norwegian Business Daily in Oslo, (Dagens Nwringsliv). We have been 
 writing about Jeffrey Epstein's political connections for a year, among them revealing how he managed to get 
 Bill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013. But our main target has 
 EFTA00030938
been the former UN assistant Secretary General, Mr. Terje Rod-Larsen, who resigned as president of the 
 International Peace Institute in New York, after we revealed his financial dealings with Epstein. I'm attaching 
 our translated articles. 
 The reason why I'm writing to You is that I see You were on the team at SDNY prosecuting him. And I've 
 heard that You reached out to some of the people who were on Epstein's flight log in recent years. I would be 
 grateful if we could exchange background information that might help us in our further investigation. We 
 have reason to believe that both Mr. Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul were on his plane one time during 
 Christmas to Epstein's island in the years 2010-2015. 
 I'm sorry for reaching out to You on this email, but I couldn't find one at the SDNY website. 
 Here are some of our 40 articles:

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 We write in response to your letter of December 28, 2020, in which you request a bill of 
 particulars in the above-captioned matter. As set forth herein, the Government does not intend to 
 provide further particulars because under the well-established law of this Circuit it has no 
 obligation to do so. To the contrary, and as you are aware, the Government outlined its charges 
 against your client in a detailed speaking superseding indictment (the "Indictment") and has since 
 provided considerable additional information through the production of to date of over 2.7 million 
 items of discovery, all in electronic form and accompanied by an index. Accordingly, the 
 Government has more than provided the defendant with adequate notice of the charges against her, 
 and no further particulars are required. 
 "A bill of particulars is required only where the charges of the indictment are so general 
 that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused." United States v. 
 Walsh, 194 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotations marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g., 
 United States v. Mahabub, No. 13 Cr. 908 (MN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 
 2014) (same); United States v. Mandell, 710 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (same). 
 "Acquisition of evidentiary details is not the function of the bill of particulars." United States v. 
 Torres, 901 F.2d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 1990), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Marcus, 
 628 F.3d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotations marks and citation omitted). 
 EFTA00030943
Nor may a bill of particulars be used as a general investigative tool. "It is not enough that 
 the information would be useful to the defendant; if the defendant has been given adequate notice 
 of the charges against him, the government is not required to disclose additional details about its 
 case." United States v. Payden, 613 F. Supp. 800, 816 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); see also, e.g., United 
 States v. Sindone, No. 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (a 
 defendant may not "use a bill of particulars to preview the government's evidence or trial strategy, 
 or to require the government to specify the minutiae of how it will prove the charges. The stakes 
 in a criminal case are high, and temptations of perjury, subornation and intimidation are ever 
 present. Accordingly, the government is not required to turn over information that will permit a 
 defendant to preview the government's case and tempt him to tailor proof to explain it away, or 
 see to it that the government's proof is not presented." (citations omitted)); United States v. 
 Guerrerio, 670 F. Supp. 1215, 1225 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (A bill of particulars "is not a discovery tool 
 and is not intended to allow defendants a preview of the evidence or the theory of the government's 
 case."). 
 A bill of particulars is unwarranted in this case because the Government has more than 
 satisfied its obligations to provide the defense with sufficient information to "prepare for trial, to 
 prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should [the defendant] be prosecuted 
 a second time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 
 1987). The Indictment contains a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offenses 
 charged, and it describes the conduct of the defendant that the Government expects to prove at trial 
 with respect to three particular victims. The Indictment itself contains a detailed description of the 
 accounts these victims have provided law enforcement. In addition to the Indictment, which 
 provides more than sufficient information about the charges against your client, you are also in 
 possession of, among other things, numerous search warrant affidavits that outline evidence 
 revealed during the Government's investigation over time (see, e.g., SDNY_GM_00000423-
 SDNY_GM_00000524); documentary evidence, including travel records and contemporaneous 
 journal entries that corroborate the victims' accounts; and the Government's letters concerning 
 bail and detention. In sum, the Indictment and the materials produced during discovery provide 
 you with more than ample information concerning the allegations that the Government intends to 
 prove at trial and the supporting evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Reinhold, 994 F. Supp. 194, 
 201 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (denying request for bill of particulars where the "indictment is detailed in 
 its allegations" and the "defendants have had extensive discovery"). 
 To the extent that your requests seek information regarding potential witnesses and/or co-
 conspirators or aiders and abettors (Requests 1-20, 22-26), the Government is not required to 
 provide such information at this time. See, e.g., United States v. D'Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 
 335 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) ("A bill of particulars is not a general investigative tool, a discovery device 
 or a means to compel the government to disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial." 
 (quoting United States v. Gibson, 175 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2001))); United States v. 
 Barrera, 950 F. Supp. 2d 461, 478-79 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying motion for bill of particulars as 
 to identities of unnamed victims of alleged murder conspiracy); United States v. Castro, No. 08 
 Cr. 268 (NRB), 2008 WL 5062724, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008) ("An indictment need not 
 identify all alleged co-conspirators, nor specify the nature, time and place of every overt act the 
 defendant or others allegedly took in furtherance of a conspiracy, nor must it set forth all the 
 evidence the government intends to introduce."); United States v. Sindone, 2002 WL 48604, at *1 
 2 
 EFTA00030944
(denying request for bill of particulars that would identify alleged co-conspirators and victims); 
 United States v. Trippe, 171 F. Supp. 2d 230, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("[D]emands for particular 
 information with respect to where, when, and with whom the Government will charge the 
 defendant with conspiring are routinely denied."); United States v. Mitlof, 165 F. Supp. 2d 558, 
 569 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("What defendant seeks is in the nature of the `wheres, whens and with 
 whoms' that [c]ourts have held to be beyond the scope of a bill of particulars." (collecting cases)); 
 United States v. Fruchter, 104 F. Supp. 2d 289, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying "Defendants' 
 request for names of all aiders, abettors, unindicted co-conspirators, and confidential informants" 
 as "nothing more than a request for a witness list"); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. As previously 
 stated, and as noted in the Government's letter dated October 28, 2020, with regard to your many 
 requests for information that fall within the scope of the Government's Giglio and Jencks Act 
 obligations, we intend to produce all such material in advance of trial and remain available to 
 confer generally regarding a mutual schedule for pretrial and trial-related disclosures, including 
 witness statements or Giglio material. 
 You seek numerous, specific details which amount to requests for a detailed preview of the 
 Government's case and its legal theories (Requests 7, 14, 19, 25, and 29). The Government is not 
 required to disclose at this juncture the way in which it expects to prove the charges or the precise 
 manner in which the defendant committed the charged crimes, nor must the Government provide 
 a preview of the evidence or legal theories it intends to present at trial. See, e.g., United States v. 
 Dupigny, 18 Cr. 528 (JMF), 2019 WL 2327697, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 2019) (denying motion 
 for bill of particulars and explaining that the defendant "need not be informed of the specific means 
 of coercion he is alleged to have employed against the still-unidentified victims in the Superseding 
 Indictment. And between the indictment, applications for search warrants, court filings, and 
 proffers during bail hearings, the Government has advised Dupigny of the nature and timeframe 
 of the conspiracy; the number of victims involved in the substantive trafficking offenses, the ages 
 of several of the victims, and the residence from which he recruited them; and the types of physical 
 force and coercion he has employed against at least some of them"); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) ("Defendant's demand that 
 the Government provide him with the specifics of how it will prove the `interstate transportation' 
 element of its case is an improper attempt to limit the Government's proof at trial and is the type 
 of `when, where, and how' bill of particular requests that are 'almost uniformly . . . denied."' 
 (citation omitted)); United States v. Monzon-Liana,No. 11 Cr. 722 (RRM), 2014 WL 223100, at 
 *4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2014) (denying request for bill of particulars where defendant was charged 
 with, among other things, sex trafficking of minors and a Mann Act violation, and stating that the 
 indictment "explains the essential facts constituting each of the crimes charge[d], the time frame 
 in which the crime is alleged to have occurred, and the victim involved. This information is 
 sufficient to apprise defendant of the charges against him."). For example, with respect to Requests 
 7, 14, 19, and 25, the Government directs your attention to the Indictment, at paragraphs 11(b), 13, 
 17(b), and 19, which refer to sex acts in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55. With 
 respect to Request 28, the Government refers you to the Indictment, at paragraph 7, which 
 describes the conduct of the defendant that the Government expects to prove at trial with respect 
 to three particular victims. Based on the foregoing, you are not entitled to the particulars sought 
 through your requests, and in any event, much of what you seek is described in the Indictment and 
 discovery. If you have authority for your requests, we would be happy to consider it.

 Good afternoon, 
 At the request of defense counsel, our office is preparing a new drive with a copy of discovery material that was 
 previously produced to Ghislaine Maxwell on a CD, but which she has been unable to view. The drive will be ready 
 tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming weekend, but 
 no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that Maxwell would not 
 receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to pick the drive up from our 
 office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. Would that be permissible? 
 Thank you,

Mr. Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, 
 using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the 
 lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said. 
 The suit also said air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private 
 plane in 2018 with girls who looked as young as 11. 
 In one undated incident detailed in the lawsuit, a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's 
 island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was 
 found, and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said. 
 Prosecutors in New York have said their investigation has continued and anyone who helped Mr. 
 Epstein could face criminal charges.
 In addition, the lawsuit said, Mr. Epstein embarked on several illegal construction projects at Great 
 Saint James, which caused damage to native coral and wildlife. 
 Continue reading  the main story 
 The more than a dozen women who have filed lawsuits against Mr. Epstein's estate in New York City 
 since his death have accused him of exploiting and sexually abusing them when they were young 
 women and girls, according to court documents. Many are seeking financial compensation. 
 The lawsuit in the Virgin Islands appears to be the first filed against the estate in that jurisdiction. Mr. 
 Epstein maintained his legal permanent residence — and his estate — there. He hastily filed his will in 
 a Virgin Islands court just days before he killed himself. 
 Ms. George's lawsuit also seeks to head off an effort by Mr. Epstein's executor, Mr. Indyke, to turn Mr. 
 Epstein's vast wealth into a victim's compensatory fund. Mr. Indyke's proposal, which is currently 
 being litigated in a separate Virgin Islands case, imposes confidentiality on any claimants, Ms. George 
 said. 
 "The estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the criminal activities of the 
 Epstein enterprise," the lawsuit said. 
 In a statement when that fund was first announced, Mr. Indyke said it would give victims "the 
 opportunity to obtain appropriate compensation and to be heard and treated with compassion, dignity 
 and respect."

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00030949
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00030950
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 PCU — Please join me in congratulating on the arrest this morning of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
 repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
 were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
 perseverance and creativity by in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
 than all of our paralegals. 
 will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given 
 current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in 
 bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.

 Subject: Discovery and Disclosure Practices -- Update 
 Date: Fri, 04 Dec 2020 16:50:46 +0000 
 All: 
 Over the last several months, the executive staff has been giving a great deal of thought to ways in which we can enhance 
 the Office's effectiveness in satisfying our discovery and disclosure obligations. Although that process is continuing, I want 
 to provide you with an update about some measures that we are implementing immediately, based on feedback we 
 received from you and your unit chiefs. 
 First, I am pleased to announce that we will maintain a standing Disclosure Committee to help the Office navigate our 
 discovery and disclosure challenges on an ongoing basis. The Disclosure Committee will be led by co-chair-
 and its members will be 
 Second, we have enlisted a Technology Working Group to evaluate possible approaches to improving our technological 
 and administrative support for your work, in close consultation with and our IT staff. That group is led by 
 a, and its members are 
 Third, we recognize that the substantive work of each unit may present particular discovery challenges. To ensure that 
 AUSAs are familiar with the particular issues that may arise with respect to the work of a particular unit, unit chiefs will 
 provide training for new AUSAs who arrive in their unit as part of the onboarding process, with an emphasis on the 
 subject -matter -specific discovery and disclosure issues that they are likely to encounter as part of the unit's work. 
 Fourth, in advance of charging senior unit cases, AUSAs will conduct agency case file reviews to ensure we have full 
 visibility on material subject to disclosure—and are not relying solely on agents to surface materials subject to disclosure. 
 While this will not be required in all junior unit cases, agency file reviews should be conducted in General Crimes and 
 Narcotics cases where unit chiefs deem it appropriate. The Disclosure Committee will be overseeing the development of 
 agency -specific checklists to help facilitate the review, but in the meantime AUSAs should use their best judgment. 
 Fifth, prosecution memos must contain a robust discussion of discovery issues and defense theories as a pre-requisite for 
 approval by chiefs in the first instance and ultimately deputy chief signoff. The Disclosure Committee will be developing 
 guidance for areas that should be covered—but, in the meantime, AUSAs and chiefs should use their best judgment. 
 Sixth, when AUSAs leave senior units they will discuss case transition planning with the unit chiefs and the Criminal Chief, 
 and memorialize the case transition planning in a memorandum addressing the status of all of their cases and specifying 
 which cases they will be retaining and which will be reassigned. These memos will require approval by both the old and 
 new unit chiefs and will be reviewed by the Criminal Chief. 
 Seventh, in those rare instances when SAUSAs are approved for a particular case, they will complete all DOJ discovery 
 training requirements and SDNY disclosure training as part of their onboarding process before they can begin work as a 
 SAUSA. We will require certification of the completion of all required training as part of the SAUSA onboarding process. 
 The Criminal Division Manual will be revised to reflect this policy. 
 Some of these practices are already being followed by some units and some AUSAs. Going forward, they will be the 
 practice of the entire Office. We hope that these practices, amplified by the forthcoming guidance from the Disclosure 
 Committee, will provide AUSAs with useful tools and better position us to discharge our disclosure obligations. 
 As always, we welcome and appreciate your feedback. If you have thoughts or suggestions about how these practices are 
 working, or these issues generally, please share them with your unit chiefs, any member of the Disclosure Committee or 
 Technology Working Grouo. or the executive staff.

 To Whom it May Concern: 
 Please be advised that the historical employment records you are requesting, for the time 
 period of "1999-2001" are no longer available. 
 I can confirm that a " appears on a spreadsheet dated back to 2000 which 
 lists terminated employees for that time (year 2000). Unfortunately, I am unable to 
 confirm whether or not this is the same person due to the fact no other information is listed 
 such as a social security number, address, position, etc. The only information listed is a 
 first and last name. 
 Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me a

 Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation through his lawyer, Jeff 
 Brown of Dechert LLP, to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. 
 Brown was informed by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither 
 a target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson about 
 which the government is seeking a response from Gov. Richardson at this time. 
 "It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe at this time the 
 Governor participated in or witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said 
 Mr. Brown. 
 Furthermore, Governor Richardson has never been contacted by any party to a lawsuit involving Epstein, nor 
 by any law enforcement investigating Epstein. Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so 
 that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court and see the justice they deserve.

 Yeah, we saw this on Friday and were a little frustrated not to have gotten the advance notice we had anticipated prior to 
 them filing. We contacted counsel on Friday and he apologized and said they've been particularly busy. So, yeah. But he 
 did send the complaint, which also has been filed on the docket, which presumably is where the Daily News found it (her 
 attorney was surprised there was media about it, so I think they didn't cause the story). Complaint is fairly bare-bones, 
 though it includes the Trump interaction she had with Epstein, and is attached here. No judge assigned yet.

 Hello and Happy New Year! 
 Here's an issue I haven't seen addressed: CP distribution case arising from multiple reports of uploads to Yahoo photo albums. Four 
 computers seized from defendant's house. CP-related activity found on all four. Forensics reveal a large compressed file on the root 
 of the C drive of the computer most actively used for CP activity. The examiner was able to save and install the file and found it to be 
 a virtual reality game call Hizashi no nakano real, in which the player uses the mouse to control a virtual hand that molests an 
 animated Asian girl whose age appears to be about 10. The game was accompanied by a detailed "walk through" document telling 
 the steps for navigating the game. This document, like the game itself, is very graphic and detailed. The only Local User who has the 
 game loaded is our defendant. Forensics show our Local User had gotten to Level 4 of the game, which involves significant and 
 sustained affirmative acts against the virtual girl. 
 Admissible? 
 I'd appreciate your thoughts.

 Totally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all 
 messed up — we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally 
 every search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because 
 the FBI case file is also huge. 
 If going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to 
 provide guidance on that.

 Hey all, below is a summary of the discovery items you've requested. 
 Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the page 
 without the post it note, so the pages are back to back. 
 Papers from Miami case file (grand jury testimony): This is a disk — I can copy it and send it over to you. 
 Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad scans 
 last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from 
 the NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. 
 FBI file: We have that ready for you. 
 CART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. 
 Evidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. This 
 is the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this together, 
 that would be very helpful. 
 If it's helpful to talk through some of this via phone, we are happy to do that as well.

 Hi and 
 The drive you provided us has some scans on it (looks like they're scans of the message pads). As I recall, there was a 
 larger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to 
 provide us with all of those scans this week? 
 With respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on 
 them and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans.

 Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
 batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
 Below are some questions regarding the discovery dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
 • The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
 contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
 • The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
 mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
 copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
 scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
 • It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. 
 Would you please get us copies of those returns? 
 Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
 please be able to get us these this week? 
 • Full FBI sentinel file 
 • CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
 • All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and 
 hard copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
 • Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
 • Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been 
 scanned, including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 Dear Counsel: 
 This letter provides additional discovery pursuant to Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of 
 Criminal Procedure ("Fed. R. Crim. P."). Based on your request for discovery in this case, today 
 we are producing copies of the materials listed in the below index, which materials are stamped 
 with control numbers SDNY_GM_000 165541 through SDNY_GM_ 00174966. A reproduction 
 of materials previously produced by the Government on August 12, 2020, which are stamped with 
 control numbers SDNY_GM_00086557 through SDNY_GM_00096055 and 
 SDNY GM 00164920 through SDNY_GM_00165517 is also included. The materials are 
 available for pickup at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. 
 Materials stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_00 166247 through 
 SDNY_GM_00166273, SDNY_GM_00 167093 through SDNY_GM_00167097, 
 SDNY GM 00167911 through SDNY_GM 00167913, SDNY_GM_00 174366 through 
 SDNY_GM_00174369, and SDNY_GM_00 174431 through SDNY_GM_00 174458 have been 
 designated as "highly confidential" because they contain nude, partially nude, or otherwise 
 sexualized images of individuals. Consistent with the Protective Order in this case, the 
 Government is only producing these "highly confidential" materials to defense counsel and is not 
 producing these materials directly to the defendant.

 This production includes certain materials from the files of the Florida office of the Federal 
 Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). The Government notes that the remainder of the Florida FBI 
 Files in PDF format designated as "confidential" under the protective order have been stamped 
 "confidential." However, certain files cannot be individually labeled as confidential on the 
 documents themselves due to their file format. Such files include in their electronic names the 
 word "Confidential." 
 06.20.2018 
 EFTA00030993

 files are loaded onto an electronic review platform and will be processed and produced on a rolling 
 basis as part of electronic discovery. 
 Additionally, the Government notes that the physical items referenced in the productions 
 to date can be made available for you to review at the FBI New York office, upon request. Those 
 physical items include numerous hard copies of photographs and discs containing photographs, 
 which were seized during searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences. As a courtesy, the FBI is in 
 the process of scanning those hard copy photographs and copying the photographs contained on 
 the discs. Once that process is complete, the Government intends to produce electronic copies of 
 any such photographs that do not contain highly confidential images. Any photographs among 
 those physical items identified as highly confidential will be made available for review at the FBI 
 New York office. 
 Finally, the Government wishes to inform you, as a courtesy, that it is in possession of a 
 copy of the FBI's case file regarding the investigation of a former employee of Jeffre E stein's 
 named for obstruction of justice (the "=IM File"). The File is 
 maintained under a different FBI case number from the investigation that led to the charges against 
 your client. The File has no relation to your client and no bearing on the charges in this 
 case. Accordingly, the Government does not intend to produce the File because it is 
 not discoverable in this case. 
 Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if 
 you wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI's custody. 
 Very truly yours,

 I hope you're well! I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW and I've been looking through Steve 
 Bannon's iPhone 7 on Cellebrite. As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and 
 Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone (see screenshot from Cellebrite, attached). I discussed with Sunny and we wanted 
 to flag this for you, in case it was of any importance to you, since you are on both cases. 
 Please let me know if you'd like anything further done with this. Thanks so much!

 As you may know IG was a prosecutor in the SDNY and I believe he wants to know if the BOP disregarded

 phone use. 
 I believe HQ wants to know if the SDNY prosecutors office or Judge had any additional requirements, requests, directives 
 or court orders that the BOP needed to comply with that are above standard BOP policy for his phone use. Such as 
 specific recording of phone calls made, reporting to the SDNY of when phone calls were made, to whom, discussion 
 topics, observing or monitoring phone calls, writing memorandums of what they BOP staff may of heard.

 We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection 
 with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by.. (copied 
 here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once 
 the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will

 And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with

I just received clarification on the question that OIG HQ has regarding the underlying case. The question and 
 clarification are below. 
 • In addition to BOP policies, did SDNY have requirements to memorialize Epstein's phone calls related to the 
 underlying case? If so, were they followed? 
 • Did BOP need to take notes on the conversation (since it's not recorded) or were they just required to keep a 
 phone number log?"

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 1 of 7 
 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
 Plaintiff, 
 No. 20-CV-833(PAE) 
 v. 
 FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
 Defendant. 
 SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF RUSSELL CAPONE 
 I, Russell Capone, hereby declare as follows: 
 I. I am Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
 New York ("USAO-SDNY"). My prior declaration in this matter dated August 5, 2020, details 
 my service in this capacity and prior service in the USAO-SDNY. As noted therein, I am familiar 
 with the Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the New York Times Company (the 
 "FOIA Requests") that are the subject of this case, which seek records related to the 
 incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). I am also 
 familiar with the responsive records that defendant the Federal Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") has 
 withheld in whole or in part pursuant to various FOIA exemptions, including GOP's 
 withholdings from the records provided back to BOP by the Office of the Inspector General of 
 the Department of Justice ("OIG") since the submission of my August 5, 2020, declaration. 
 2. The statements contained in this declaration are based on my personal 
 knowledge, documents maintained in the files of the USAO-SDNY, conversations with members 
 of the Noel and Tartaglione prosecution teams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and 
 conclusions made in accordance therewith. 
 EFTA00031018
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 7 
 3. I submit this declaration in further support of BOP's motion for summary 
 judgment in this case. Specifically, this declaration addresses the bases for the withholding in 
 whole or in part of certain records provided back to BOP by OIG pursuant to FOIA Exemption 
 7(A). 
 Records Withheld in Full or in Part from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on 
 Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
 4. 5 U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) ("Exemption 7(A)") exempts from disclosure "records 
 or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production 
 of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere 
 with enforcement proceedings ...." 
 5. I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of 
 the records provided back to BOP by CMG that BOP withheld in full or in part under Exemption 
 7(A) (the "7(A) Returned Records"), including those reflected as withheld in full at Entries 55-
 57 and 60 on the updated index attached to the Supplemental Declaration of Kara Christenson 
 (the "updated BOP index"). The 7(A) Returned Records fall into four categories: documents 
 related to counts of inmates, staffing records, psychology records, and entries on certain BOP 
 logs for August 9 and 10, 2019. Each of these categories fall within the scope of Exemption 
 7(A). 
 6. Public disclosure of the 7(A) Returned Records could reasonably be expected to 
 interfere with the pending Noel prosecutions. These records include information about which 
 numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, details that are not publicly known or known 
 to other witnesses, and information and documents prepared by potential trial witnesses. These 
 records also include potential trial exhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not 
 seen. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein could 
 2 
 EFTA00031019
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 3 of 7 
 reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or enable 
 witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
 7. Further, premature public disclosure of any of the 7(A) Returned Records could 
 reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and 
 impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of these records will be entered 
 into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other records that may not be trial exhibits bear on the 
 contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information 
 contained therein could influence potential jurors' understanding of the evidence at trial and the 
 case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the records and/or the information contained 
 therein could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
 would also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 In addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are 
 expected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents prepared by potential trial 
 witnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence 
 potential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. 
 8. The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media 
 coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of 
 Epstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the 
 records are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who 
 have been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. 
 9. The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of 7(A) 
 Returned Records. 
 10. First, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
 documents related to counts of inmates, including count slips, associated inmate rosters, and 
 3 
 EFTA00031020
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 4 of 7 
 records of rounds and checks, for dates between and including July 23, 2019, and August 12, 
 2019, will be the subject of trial testimony at the Noel trial. 7(A) Returned Records containing 
 such documents are noted at Entry 55 of the updated BOP index.' In addition, the government 
 anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. Releasing these materials 
 prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, 
 allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence, identify potential 
 government witnesses at the Noel trial, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness 
 testimony or evidence. 
 II. One subcategory of these documents are records from the Special Housing Unit 
 (the "SHU"), specifically rosters of inmates in the SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and SHU 
 records showing which BOP employees conducted rounds in the SHU. Although BOP had 
 previously withheld six pages of these records in full, included at Entries 22, 34 and 37 of the 
 prior index submitted by BOP, the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution and I 
 determined that these records could be released in part without interfering with the Noel 
 prosecution, provided that information on these records showing details of the occupants of the 
 SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and which BOP employees conducted rounds in the SHU was 
 redacted. Releasing such information prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence 
 witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to 
 In reviewing the records returned to BOP by OIG, the prosecutors responsible for the Noel and 
 Tartaglione prosecutions and I determined that a one-page attorney visit room inventory log, 
 dated July 21, 2019, and an 18-page inmate census roster, dated August 9, 2019, each of which 
 BOP had previously withheld in full under Exemption 7(A), could be released without a 
 reasonable expectation of interference with the Noel or Tartaglione prosecutions. The attorney 
 visit room inventory log was previously listed at Entry 26 of GOP's index, and the census roster 
 was previously included among the count documents noted at Entry 24 of GOP's index. 
 4 
 EFTA00031021
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 5 of 7 
 conform to other evidence, identify potential government witnesses at the Noel trial, and/or 
 influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
 12. Second, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
 MCC staffing records, including daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 23, August 9, and 
 10, 2019, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. 7(A) Returned Records 
 containing such documents are noted at Entry 56 of the updated BOP index? In addition, the 
 government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. Releasing these 
 materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony 
 at trial, allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence, and/or 
 influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
 13. Third, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
 certain psychological notes and records of Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the 
 subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. 7(A) 
 Returned Records containing such documents are noted at Entry 57 of the updated BOP index. 
 Premature disclosure of these records could influence the testimony of potential witnesses, 
 including by potentially causing them to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other 
 evidence. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be expected to 
 prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which would impair 
 the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 14. Fourth, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
 entries in certain BOP logs for August 9 and 10, 2019, may be trial exhibits, the subject of 
 2 The daily assignment rosters included in the 7(A) Returned Records appear identical to the 
 daily assignment rosters BOP previously located and withheld in response to the FOIA Requests, 
 except that they contain a different date stamp, which I understand to indicate when they were 
 electronically generated. 
 5 
 EFTA00031022
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 6 of 7 
 witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. 7(A) Returned 
 Records containing such documents are noted at Entry 60 of the updated BOP index. Premature 
 disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential 
 testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, and/or 
 influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
 7(A) Returned Records Withheld in Part from Disclosure Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
 Account of Likely Interference with Tartaglione 
 15. The release of portions of two 7(A) Returned Records could also be reasonably 
 expected to interfere with the Tartaglione prosecution. First, portions of psychological records, 
 withheld in full as noted at Entry 57 of the updated BOP index, concerning the circumstances of 
 Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, could reasonably be expected to interfere 
 with the prosecution of Tartaglione. Second, premature release of one of the entries in a 
 lieutenant's log dated July 23, 2019, concerning the circumstances of Epstein's apparent suicide 
 attempt on that date, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of 
 Tartaglione. 
 16. As discussed in my prior declaration, Tartaglione's interactions with Epstein in 
 July 2019 have been placed at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection 
 with the potential penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 
 2010, Dkt. No. 186, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK); Letter dated January 
 21, 2020, Dkt. No. 193, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense 
 counsel's position, the information contained in the psychological records and in the entry in the 
 lieutenant's log may be relevant evidence in any possible penalty phase of the case against 
 Tartaglione. In that event, premature release of the information could reasonably be expected to 
 6 
 EFTA00031023
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 7 of 7 
 adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential jurors' perceptions of 
 Tartaglione, thereby impairing the district court's ability to scat a fair and impartial jury. 
 Segregabilitv 
 17. The 7(A) Returned Records withheld in full are exempt from disclosure in their 
 entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt information, 
 such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably be expected 
 to interfere with the Noel prosecution for the reasons discussed above. As noted in my previous 
 declaration, the media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the 
 segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing 
 information pertaining to Epstein without complete context risks contributing to the 
 dissemination of speculation and theories about his death. This, in turn, could reasonably be 
 expected to interfere with the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Noel, for 
 the reasons discussed above. 
 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true 
 and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. 
 Executed this p2- day of January 2021.

 Defendant. 
 DECLARATION OF RUSSELL CAPONE 
 I, Russell Capone, hereby declare as follows: 
 1. I am Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney in the United States Attorney's 
 Office for the Southern District of New York ("USAO-SDNY"). I have served in this capacity 
 since June 2020. Prior to my current role, I served as Deputy Chief and then Chief of the Public 
 Corruption Unit in the USAO-SDNY from July 2017 and as an Assistant United States Attorney 
 from January 2011. I supervised the Noel prosecution directly in my prior role as Chief of the 
 Public Corruption Unit, and I play a supervisory role over both the Noel and Tartaglione 
 prosecutions in my current role as Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney. 
 2. I am familiar with the Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the New 
 York Times Company (the "FOIA Requests") that are the subject of this case, which seek 
 records related to the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
 ("MCC"). I am also familiar with the responsive records that defendant the Federal Bureau of 
 Prisons ("BOP") has withheld pursuant to exemptions 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(E), and 7(F) of FOIA, 5 
 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)-(7). In addition, I am familiar with the proceedings in United States of

 America v. Noel, 19-CR-830 (Al), and United States of America v. Tartaglione, 16-CR-832 
 (KMK). True and correct copies of the Indictment filed in Noel on November 19, 2019 (the 
 "Noel Indictment"), and the Superseding Indictment filed in Tartaglione on April 16, 2019 (the 
 "Tartaglione Indictment"), are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B, respectively. The statements 
 contained in this declaration are based on my personal knowledge, documents maintained in the 
 files of the USAO-SDNY, conversations with members of the Noel and Tartaglione prosecution 
 teams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and conclusions made in accordance therewith. 
 3. I submit this declaration in support of BOP's motion for summary judgment in 
 this case. 
 The Prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein 
 4. On July 2, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was charged with one count of conspiracy to 
 commit sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex trafficking, in 
 violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and 
 thereafter incarcerated at the MCC until his death. 
 5. On July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the Special Housing Unit ("SHU") at 
 the MCC due to, among other things, a risk of suicidality and safety concerns relating to housing 
 him with the MCC's general population. On July 18, 2019, a bond hearing as to Epstein was 
 held before the Honorable Richard M. Berman, after which the Court granted the government's 
 motion for remand and denied Epstein's motion for pretrial release. See Noel Indictment 1 10. 
 6. On July 23, 2019, MCC officers responded to an emergency call and found 
 Epstein on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. See Noel Indictment 
 1 11. Michael Thomas, a correctional officer at the MCC and one of the defendants in the Noel 
 case, was one of the MCC officials who responded to this incident. See id. Epstein was 
 subsequently transferred out of the SHU, placed on suicide watch for 24 hours, and then 
 2 
 EFTA00031026
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 3 of 13 
 transferred to psychological observation, a different status in a different location within MCC's 
 hospital ward, until July 30, 2019. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to the SHU. 
 See /dill 11-13. 
 7. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found in his cell, not responsive and with a 
 noose around his neck. See id.1 26. He was transferred to a local hospital where he was 
 declared dead shortly thereafter. See id. 1 27. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the 
 City of New York conducted an autopsy and determined that Epstein had committed suicide by 
 hanging himself. See id. 
 8. On August 29, 2019, following a public hearing on August 27, 2019, Judge 
 Berman entered an order of nolle prosequi against Epstein. See Nolle Prosequi, Dkt. No. 52, 
 United States v. Epstein, No. 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.). 
 The Prosecution of Tova Noel and Michael Thomas 
 9. As alleged in the Noel Indictment, Thomas and Tova Noel were correctional 
 officers on duty at the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, the night of Epstein's death. See Noel 
 Indictment 11 3-4. On that night, Noel and Thomas repeatedly failed to perform mandated 
 counts of prisoners under their watch, including Epstein. To conceal this failure, they repeatedly 
 signed false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates, when, in 
 truth, they had not conducted such counts. See id. 11 15-24. On November 19, 2019, Noel and 
 Thomas were charged in the Noel Indictment with one count of conspiring to defraud the United 
 States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States 
 Code, Section 371; and five counts as to Noel and three counts as to Thomas of making or using 
 a false writing or document, in violation of Tide 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 
 (2). Noel Indictment ¶9[ 28-40. The Noel case is pending before the Honorable Analisa Torres. 
 Trial has been scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021.

 The Prosecution and Incarceration of Nicholas Tartaglione 
 10. In a superseding indictment filed on April 16, 2019, Nicholas Tartaglione was 
 charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, in violation of Title 21, United 
 States Code, Section 846; four counts of intentional killing in furtherance of a drug trafficking 
 crime, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 848(e)(1)(A) and Title 18, United 
 States Code, Section 2; three counts of murder through the use of a firearm in furtherance of a 
 drug trafficking crime, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 924(j) and 2; one 
 count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, in violation of Title 18, United State Code, Section 
 1201; four counts of kidnapping resulting in death, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
 Sections 1201(a)(1) and 2; and four counts of using a facility of interstate commerce to commit a 
 crime of violence in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1952 and 2. These 
 charges arise from the April 2016 murders of Martin Luna, Miguel Luna, Urbano Santiago, and 
 Hector Gutierrez. On April 19, 2019, USAO-SDNY filed a Notice of Intent to Seek the Death 
 Penalty against Tartaglione. The Tartaglione case is pending before the Honorable Kenneth M. 
 Karns. No trial date has been set. 
 II. Tartaglione has been detained since he was arrested on December 19, 2016. For 
 certain periods of his detention, including in July 2019, Tartaglione was housed at the MCC. In 
 early July 2019, Tartaglione was transferred to the MCC's SHU. For a time, including on July 
 23, 2019, Tartaglione was housed in the same SHU cell as Jeffrey Epstein. 
 Records Withheld from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on 
 Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
 12. 5 U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) ("Exemption 7(A)") exempts from disclosure "records 
 or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production 
 4 
 EFTA00031028
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 5 of 13 
 of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere 
 with enforcement proceedings ...." 
 13. I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of 
 the records responsive to the FOIA requests withheld in full or in part under Exemption 7(A), 
 including those reflected on the index prepared by BOP and attached to the declaration of Kara 
 Christenson (the "BOP index"). All of these records fall within the scope of Exemption 7(A). 
 14. Public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 7(A) could reasonably 
 be expected to interfere with the pending prosecutions of Noel and Thomas. These records 
 include information about which numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, include 
 details that are not publicly known or known to other witnesses, and include information and 
 documents authored by potential trial witnesses. These records also include potential trial 
 exhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not seen, and premature disclosure of 
 those materials could influence witness testimony at trial, or enable witnesses to change or shape 
 their testimony. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein 
 could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow 
 witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
 15. Further, premature public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 
 7(A) could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to 
 seat a fair and impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of the records 
 withheld under Exemption 7(A) will be entered into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other 
 records that may not be trial exhibits bear on the contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature 
 disclosure of these records, or the information contained therein, could influence potential jurors' 
 understanding of the evidence at trial and the case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the 
 records could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
 5 
 EFTA00031029
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 6 of 13 
 would also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 In addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are 
 expected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents authored by potential trial 
 witnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence 
 potential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. 
 16. The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media 
 coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of 
 Epstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the 
 records are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who 
 have been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. 
 Non -Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
 Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
 17. The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of responsive 
 non -email records withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). 
 18. First, the government anticipates that MCC staffing records, including overtime 
 logs and daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 22, July 23 August 9, and 10, 2019 and 
 some of the dates in between, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. In 
 addition, the government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. 
 Releasing these materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' 
 potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, 
 or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
 19. Second, the government anticipates that reports and memoranda prepared by 
 BOP, such as the reports, memoranda, photographs, and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 
 apparent suicide attempt; reports, memoranda, and letters concerning Epstein's August 10, 2019 
 6 
 EFTA00031030
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 7 of 13 
 suicide and surrounding events; documents in BOP's possession from the New York City Office 
 of Chief Medical Examiner; and reports and letters concerning MCC's and BOP's response to 
 Epstein's death, may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, or were prepared by 
 witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be 
 expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their 
 testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness 
 testimony or evidence. Alternatively, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or 
 August 10, 2019 suicide and surrounding events is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial 
 publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants 
 in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which 
 would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 20. Third, the government anticipates that certain medical and psychological records 
 of Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were 
 prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these records could 
 influence the testimony of potential witnesses, including by potentially causing them to alter or 
 confirm their testimony. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be 
 expected to prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
 would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 21. Fourth, the government anticipates that documents related to counts of inmates, 
 including logs, count slips, and rosters, and other entries in BOP logs for August 9 and 10 may 
 be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will 
 testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence 
 witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to 
 other evidence, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
 7 
 EFTA00031031
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 8 of 13 
 22. Fifth, the government anticipates that an August 8, 2019, review of inmates in the 
 SHU prepared by BOP may be a trial exhibit, the subject of witness testimony, and/or was 
 prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of this record could 
 reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow witnesses 
 to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
 Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
 Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
 23. The considerations discussed above also apply to each of the categories of 
 responsive email documents withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). 
 24. First, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, his 
 incarceration prior to his suicide, and his mental health, including emails written by BOP's 
 Psychology Services, discuss topics and information that the government anticipates may be the 
 subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness 
 testimony, including by allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, 
 or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as 
 described above, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or is excluded from 
 evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for 
 or against the defendants in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be 
 shown during trial, which would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a 
 fair and impartial jury. 
 25. Second, emails relating to Epstein's death, investigations into Epstein's death, the 
 circumstances of his suicide, and the BOP's response to Epstein's death discuss topics and 
 information that the government anticipates will be relevant to and/or the subject of witness 
 testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness testimony, including by 
 8 
 EFTA00031032
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 9 of 13 
 allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential 
 jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as described above, if 
 evidence of Epstein's suicide is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these 
 materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action on 
 the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which would impair the 
 government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 26. Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how 
 their release would interfere with the Noel prosecution would itself risk interfering with the Noel 
 prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions of the documents 
 anticipated to be proffered as exhibits at trial, or that bear on other trial exhibits, would disclose 
 elements of the Government's trial strategy in Noel, including its selection of trial exhibits and 
 the anticipated content of witness testimony. More detailed public descriptions could also 
 prematurely disclose how the prosecution team expects the trial to proceed. 
 Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
 Account of Likely Interference With Tartaglione 
 27. In the course of reviewing the responsive records that BOP has withheld pursuant 
 to Exemption 7(A), prosecutors in the Criminal Division of the USAO-SDNY determined that 
 certain of the records refer to or discuss Tartaglione (the "Tartaglione Records"). Upon 
 determining that some of the records withheld by BOP refer to or discuss Tartaglione, USAO-
 SDNY reviewed these records to determine whether their release would interfere with the 
 pending criminal action against Tartaglione. USAO-SDNY has concluded that release of certain 
 of the withheld records could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of 
 Tartaglione. This constitutes a basis to withhold these records under Exemption 7(A), 
 independent from the likely interference with the Noel prosecution discussed above. 
 9 
 EFTA00031033
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 10 of 13 
 28. The Tartaglione Records fall within several categories of responsive documents 
 withheld by BOP and include reports and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide 
 attempt; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email correspondence 
 between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; and medical and psychological 
 records of Epstein prepared by BOP. The Tartaglione Records also include emails pertaining to 
 Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, Epstein's mental and physical health, and 
 Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide. 
 29. The Tartaglione Records fall within the scope of 7(A) because their disclosure 
 could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of Tartaglione. The Tartaglione 
 Records contain, among other things, information about Tartaglione's incarceration, including 
 the period of time during which Tartaglione was Epstein's cellmate at the MCC, which includes 
 the date of Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. The conditions of Tartaglione's 
 confinement at the MCC, as well as his interactions with Epstein in July 2019, have been put 
 directly at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection with the potential 
 penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 2010, Dkt. No. 186, 
 United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (ICMK); Letter dated January 21, 2020, Dkt. No. 
 193, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense counsel's position, 
 information contained in the Tartaglione Records may be relevant evidence in any possible 
 penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione, and as a result, premature public disclosure of the 
 Tartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to influence witness testimony and/or 
 potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
 30. Moreover, the nature of the charges against Epstein and the circumstances of his 
 apparent suicide attempt and death create a risk that premature public disclosure of the 
 Tartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the 
 10 
 EFTA00031034
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 11 of 13 
 defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Tartaglione, particularly for purposes of a 
 potential penalty-phase hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, by influencing potential juror 
 perceptions of any interactions between Epstein and Tartaglione. 
 31. The risks of interference with the Tartaglione proceedings are heightened by the 
 media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. As noted previously, many 
 publicly -discussed theories of Epstein's death are unfounded. The public dissemination of these 
 theories increases the risk that premature release of the Tartaglione Records could influence 
 witness testimony or jurors' perceptions, if records are released in part or without full context. 
 32. The Tartaglione Records include several categories of records withheld by BOP. 
 Specifically, the government anticipates that premature disclosure of the reports and evidence of 
 Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt; an inmate investigative report prepared prior to 
 Epstein's death; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email 
 correspondence between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; the August 8, 
 2019 review of inmates in the SHU at MCC; and the medical and psychological records of 
 Epstein prepared by BOP, including documents pertaining to his mental health, could reasonably 
 be expected to adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential jurors' 
 perceptions of Tartaglione, thereby impairing the district court's ability to seat a fair and 
 impartial jury. In addition, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, 
 Epstein's mental health, and Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide, including emails that 
 involve members of the defense or prosecution teams in Tartaglione, discuss topics and 
 information that could adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential 
 juror's perceptions of Tartaglione. These records likewise could reasonably be expected to 
 impair the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
 II 
 EFTA00031035
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 12 of 13 
 33. Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how 
 their release would affect the Tartaglione prosecution would itself risk interfering with the 
 Tartaglione prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions would 
 potentially implicate and publicize associations, interactions, or perceptions of associations or 
 interactions between Tartaglione and Epstein, thereby risking influencing potential jurors in 
 proceedings against Tartaglione, including for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3593. 
 Segregability 
 34. The records withheld in full under Exemption 7(A) are exempt from disclosure in 
 their entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt 
 information, such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably 
 be expected to interfere with the Noel and/or Tartaglione prosecutions for the reasons discussed 
 above. The media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the 
 segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing 
 information pertaining to Epstein (or Tartaglione and Epstein) without complete context can 
 reasonably be expected to contribute to the dissemination of speculation and theories about his 
 death. This, in turn, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the district court's ability to 
 seat a fair and impartial jury in proceedings against Noel, Thomas, and/or Tartaglione, including 
 for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, for the reasons discussed above.

 TOVA NOEL and 
 MICHAEL THOMAS, 
 Defendants.

 INDICTMENT 
 16 - (IUM 
 830 
 INTRODUCTION 
 1. On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
 THOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as 
 correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
 ("MCC"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners 
 under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). 
 Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS 
 sat at their desk, browsed the Internet, and moved around the 
 common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their 
 duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
 attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in 
 truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result 
 of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
 were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as 
 a result of the defendants' conduct, no correctional officer 
 conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 
 EFTA00031039
Cagage2D19-698C3830A1E1 ODmcaunmwnt2f2-Fil€dEklagIfl20'a@ageB b021 
 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
 which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
 of an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
 overnight while unobserved. 
 RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
 2. The MCC is a federal administrative detention 
 facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
 Prisons ("BOP"). The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
 house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
 Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. The MCC 
 employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the 
 care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
 3. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
 correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. As of 
 August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. On August 9, 
 2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
 SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
 August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. NOEL had also worked a regular 
 shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
 8 p.m. 
 4. MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
 a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. 
 Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work as a

CageSe2DI94OO3:383B413 0accaurreent22-FilaldilaMS2CPagE*of 2,021 
 materials handler supervisor, although THOMAS regularly worked 
 overtime shifts as a correctional officer, including in the SHU. 
 THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU on August 10, 2019, 
 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. THOMAS did not work his regular shift on 
 August 8 or August 9, 2019, but did work an overtime shift in the 
 SHU on August 9, 2019 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
 5. As detailed herein, Jeffrey Epstein was 
 incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
 his suicide on August 10, 2019. Epstein was detained pending 
 trial in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking 
 charges. 
 THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
 6. The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
 any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
 the MCC. The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
 are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
 their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
 The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
 that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
 remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
 (the "Control Center"), which is located on the first floor of the 
 MCC. Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
 door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have 
 EFTA00031041
Caeage2DIS-O1:69930933 - famaurremtZe-FilaldclagLIS2CPagarii 2,021 
 keys while on duty. Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
 separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
 locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
 have keys while on duty. Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
 can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell - 
 which is made of cement and metal - is accessed only through a 
 single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
 to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
 7. The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
 guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
 inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
 is alive and accounted for within the MCC (the "institutional 
 count"). On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
 at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an 
 institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
 of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
 basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two 
 officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
 housing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to 
 document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
 called a count slip. To perform the institutional count in the 
 SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
 each individual inmate. 
 4 
 EFTA00031042
Cae.age2DI9-698C38304(E IlDoonurreentZe-FilklalagO5120)a@aeci3 b021 
 8. On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
 required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
 write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
 counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional 
 officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips 
 are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
 officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
 the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
 roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. Only after 
 all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
 numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
 roster, can the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or 
 completed. If a housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
 incomplete, then the institution cannot "clear" the count. 
 Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
 via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
 "bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
 inmate to the institution's inmate roster. Records of each 
 institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
 supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
 9. In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
 requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
 the tiers of the SHU - which is called a "round" - every thirty 
 EFTA00031043
Cagage21:1419-6933830,413 - IIDmoturremt2I2-FilalEklIMS2Pagefeol 2,021 
 minutes ("30-minute rounds"). Like the institutional counts, 
 correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
 inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. Correctional 
 officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
 is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
 and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
 EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
 10. On July 6, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein was 
 arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On 
 July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
 things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
 to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
 11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
 SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
 on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
 MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
 responded to the incident. Epstein was subsequently transferred 
 out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. Inmates placed 
 on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
 of the MCC, and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
 member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
 12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
 twenty-four hours, and then was transferred to psychological 
 6 
 EFTA00031044
Cagage2D-3:9-6O3O8213Ala 0Dmaiurremt2I2-FilalarlaalS2PagecEl 2,021 
 observation, until July 30, 2019. Psychological observation is 
 less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
 in the hospital wing of the MCC and watched twenty-four hours a 
 day. 
 13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
 the SHU, and, at the direction of the MCC's psychological staff, 
 was required to have an assigned cellmate. Epstein was also 
 assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
 the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
 from the cell. Conducting the required institutional counts and 
 thirty -minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's 
 procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
 EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
 14. On August 9, 2019, Epstein's cellmate was 
 transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer at 
 approximately 8 a.m. Despite the MCC's psychological staff's 
 direction that Epstein have a cellmate, no new cellmat6 was 
 assigned to Epstein's cell. 
 15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
 officers on duty in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
 a.m. on August 10. From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., two other officers 
 were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
 work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 
 7 
 EFTA00031045
Caeage2D1S-(093C3830 IlDoonurrentZ12-FilEalalagi151200agagc9 3021 
 assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2"). MICHAEL 
 THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on 
 August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS 
 were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
 16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 
 8 a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including 
 TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
 conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
 9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and 
 the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
 paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed 
 herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
 in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
 17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were 
 responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
 SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
 makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
 Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
 that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
 performed. In reliance on that falsified count slip, at 
 approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
 count.

 18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
 attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
 defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. NOEL 
 and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
 immediately thereafter. 
 19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
 locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA 
 NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
 the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from 
 the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
 Officer -2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. Nonetheless, NOEL 
 and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
 that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. In 
 reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
 the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
 20. As reflected on video obtained from the MCC's 
 internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on 
 August 9, 2019 - after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and 
 submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had 
 been completed - NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back 
 from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. As 
 confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC's internal video 
 surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any

 correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only 
 entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until 
 approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
 21. Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
 and at approximately 12 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, 
 replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
 two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. NOEL and THOMAS 
 were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
 the SHU. As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video 
 surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
 count. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
 slip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely stated that the 
 institutional count had been performed. In reliance on that 
 falsified count slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control 
 Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
 22. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
 additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
 institutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the 
 MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
 perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. NOEL and THOMAS 
 nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
 falsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
 institutional counts. In reliance on those falsified count slips, 
 10 
 EFTA00031048
Caetale2DISLOGGCB319443 Macturreerit22-FilcaleidiE0312Pagla iff 2,021 
 at approximately 3:24 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
 cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
 23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
 duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
 TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
 of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
 approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
 and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
 affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
 24. During the night, instead of completing the 
 required counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
 defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
 SHU common area (as noted above, approximately 15 feet from 
 Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
 common area. For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
 THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
 asleep. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
 including to search the Internet for furniture sales and benefit 
 websites. THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
 and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
 25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
 briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
 NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk,

 before leaving. At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
 officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. Aside from 
 those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
 else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
 throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
 was housed. 
 26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
 THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of 
 breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
 only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
 walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
 serve breakfast. At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was 
 activated in the SHU. Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
 responsive, with a noose around his neck. A supervisor who had 
 just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
 almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
 the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
 that "Epstein hung himself." After arriving in the SHU, 
 Supervisor -1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. NOEL told Supervisor-1 
 " we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." THOMAS stated, 
 " we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
 any rounds."

 27. Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
 he was declared dead shortly thereafter. The Office of the Chief 
 Medical Examiner of the City of New York conducted an autopsy and 
 determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself.

 Sasse Statement on Arrests of 
 Epstein's Guards 
 "These arrests are important, but they're not the end of this: These guards 
 aren't the only ones who should stand trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-
 conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars." 
 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who 
 warned the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to come to today's oversight hearing prepared to 
 give answers, issued the following statement regarding the arrests of two of Jeffrey Epstein's 
 EFTA00031081
prison guards. 
 "Good. Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died. The Bureau of Prisons and the 
 Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are 
 important, but they're not the end of this: These guards aren't the only ones who should stand 
 trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives 
 behind bars." 
 Background: 
 On November 13 Sasse told the Director of Bureau of Prisons to show up to today's hearing 
 prepared to answer questions. 
 On August 19, when Attorney General Barr removed the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, 
 Sasse praised the move and called for more answers. 
 On August 13, Sasse urged Attorney General Barr to rip up the plea deal with Epstein that still 
 shields his co-conspirators. That letter is available here. 
 On August 10, the day of Epstein's death, Sasse wrote to Attorney General Barr demanding that 
 "heads must roll" and asking transparency questions to make sure the DOJ answers for the 
 miscarriage of justice. 
 In February 2019, at Sasse's insistence the Department of Justice opened an investigation into 
 its handling of Epstein, who was charged with running a child sex trafficking ring in New York and 
 Florida, among other locations. 
 On January 15 2019 during his confirmation hearing, William Barr, the President's nominee for 
 Attorney General, publicly committed to making sure that the DOJ responded to Senator Sasse's 
 questions into the Epstein case and that they would prioritize the prosecution of sex-trafficking. 
 In late 2018, Sasse repeatedly pushed the DOJ to investigate the sweetheart deal 
 that Epstein received.

 As a result of this new law, victims of childhood sexual abuse whose voices were never heard and whose stories were 
 never told have now been given a new chance to come forward, to share their experiences, and to vindicate their rights, 
 all goals wholeheartedly shared by my Office, which is committed to using the federal criminal law to the maximum extent 
 possible to investigate and prosecute those who sexually abuse and traffic minors. 
 As many of you know, last year, my Office brought criminal sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein, a serial predator 
 who, over a period of years, abused dozens and potentially hundreds of young girls. To do so, we relied on the courage of 
 many young women who were victimized as minors and who were willing -- years after their abuse — to share their 
 stories. And while Epstein committed suicide before he could face trial, our investigation into his co-conspirators 
 continues. 
 As I have said publicly before, we can only do the work we do with the assistance of victims willing to come forward. By 
 providing victims of childhood sexual abuse with a new opportunity to be heard, this law marks not only an important 
 step for victims' rights but will help facilitate the work of law enforcement in identifying and prosecuting those who prey 
 on and seek to do harm to our most vulnerable.

 Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a

 Epstein then placed 84,000. in d.s. currency, one hundred dollar 
 bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does 
 when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the

 were thirteen one hundred dolla1 bills still in the white envelope

 then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though 
 the suspect was familiar with te house and the desk. Epstein 
 told me that he did not know wh the suspect in the photo was 
 but thought it might be his forger houseman because of his size 
 and shape. Epstein also pointed lout that the suspect in the

 It is believed that the suspectialeo left the house by the

 Following up on our brief discussion of this issue earlier this month, I wanted to see if you had any additional thoughts on 
 how to handle requests from counsel for plaintiffs who are suing Epstein and his estate who ask us for information or 
 materials in connection with our investigation — I think you had said we should instruct them to submit Touhy Requests, 
 and that you would designate a Civil Division person to whom we could have them direct those requests. If that's right, 
 could you please let us know who that person will be? So far we've just gotten the request from one plaintiff's counsel, 
 Robbie Kaplan at Kaplan Hecker, and her request is very narrow but we want to set up the system in a way that will work if 
 we get additional and/or more expansive requests going forward. And we would like to let her know how she should 
 proceed relatively soon because that case has a status conference on January 10 and I think they'd like to make the 
 request before then. 
 Please let us know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks as always.

 The PAE issue of case prioritization seems to be getting worse and we wanted to get your thoughts. The
 -
 was put on the priority list back in September but the team is 
 unfortunately now back to getting the answer from PAE/database managers that there are only 2 priority cases that is 
 taking up all of the PAE resources, Epstein and 377 Union Street. ThEteam sent search warrant returns to PAE on 
 9/22 and followed up yesterday to see if there was any ETA on getting them loaded and were told no. I completely 
 understand that not all jobs can be a rush job but am hopeful that we can find a way for some of the PAE bandwidth to be 
 reserved to load data in the normal course. If there could be a set expectation in terms of a timeline by which PAE is 
 expected to load data in the normal course, I think that would be helpful guidance for us to provide to our unit so they 
 can plan accordingly. 
 Happy to discuss.

 I made a few small changes (which I highlighted since we've got a fair bit of track already) which

 I apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the 
 order, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it 
 doesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents — that may be because they're not referenced in any 
 will? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless 
 somebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any documents 
 on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with El and/or MI tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore 
 it if I've misread.

 Yes, I think this document accurately describes the materials we've received, with just a note that it doesn't appear to 
 include revocations, so to the extent those are intended to be shared, I think that word may need to be added.

 We could also unseal but not have the press office blast it out to the world until tomorrow morning. It's, of course, 
 possible word gets out that she's been arrested and folks start asking for it (at which point I assume we could then give it 
 to them), although I don't think the Epstein arrest did get out immediately, somewhat surprisingly. 
 That said, I also don't have any problem putting out the indictment this afternoon and announcing there will be a press 
 conference first thing tomorrow morning. I know Audrey has some concerns about that, but subject to the views of the 
 press office, I would think a little delay teased with the details in the indictment would heighten, not diminish, interest in 
 the press conference.

 We did. The difference is that the courthouse was closed. I think we would do that if it were after business hours. The 
 question is whether the same thing applies if she is arrested at 2 p.m. today.

 I just looked back at what we did on Epstein, because we obviously dealt with the same issue of him being arrested a 
 day or two before the press conference. It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday 
 morning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter. 
 That said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early 
 tomorrow morning.

 Even 1 pm is sort of late to do a conference today. What are your thoughts about unsealing if she is arrested during 
 business hours while our clerk's office is open, but isn't presented until tomorrow?

 FYI, the presentment cut off in DNH is 1pm, and if we miss it, she'll get held in a local jail until tomorrow morning. 
 Consistent with your views this morning, I might propose that we suggest to Audrey and the press office that if we 
 don't have her by 1, we plan to put off the press conference until tomorrow morning, since at that point she won't be 
 presented until tomorrow in any event.

 Hi M, 
 Here's the final version we plan to file in the morning. It's in brief format, at the District of New Hampshire's request. The 
 plan is to file it in SDNY and email a copy to the DNH magistrate judge, but let us know if you think we should proceed 
 otherwise (the AUSA in DNH didn't seem to have a view on how we should file). We didn't want to file it with New 
 Hampshire captions and signature blocks, as much as I would have gotten a kick out of signing as a SAUSA. But let us know 
 if you think we should be going about this a different way. 
 Thanks!

 into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The 
 western most gate was in the closed position. The front was 
 locked on my approach and L continued traveling to the west 
 where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep 
 gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with 
 a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk 
 way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra 
 coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any 
 signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have 
 left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None 
 was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was 
 79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small 
 cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer 
 equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been 
 touched or tampered with. 
 On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr. 
 Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the 
 intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer 
 room and Florida type room and has three double eliding glass 
 windows present. The eastern most and western most are 
 identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has 
 three glass panels and ie the only one of the three that has a set of 
 14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring ie a 
 wood type of flooring and the western set of eliding doors was 
 found ajar, however the eandy area directly outside of the door did 
 not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The 
 central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism 
 in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to 
 have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were 
 found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the 
 eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a 
 fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a 
 rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central 
 window. 
 Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is 
 a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The 
 black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and wan placed on 
 the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The 
 individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash 
 from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar 
 bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen 
 one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of net. 
 Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned 
 directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the 
 desk, cides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for 
 latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found 
 on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters 
 and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a 
 supplement to that effect that will follow.

 Good morning all, 
 Anyone have briefing in response to defense counsel's efforts to call at trial numerous (here, 7) agents involved in the 
 investigation, to varying degrees, in an effort to impeach the investigation? Something maybe akin to — you can't put the 
 investigation on trial. 
 (They've provided a Touhy letter, so not looking for that).

 PRESS GUIDANCE 
 Friday, November 26, 2021 
 *OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses will be 
 testifying in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion (attached) 
 requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, 
 explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have 
 been victims. I believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims 
 without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy.

 I just had positive conversations with and= (and =) -= had understood that FBI was getting their own 
 hard drive to transfer the data, which obviously makes sense. response to email was to just have 
 order a 12 TB drive, which she expects will get to next week. I also think that's a better option than the 2 TB 
 drive that I= says we have available on short notice, given that we expect the data to be somewhere around 20-40 TB 
 (the capacity of the devices we seized is around 40-50 TB). 
 I take it from email that he's otherwise ready to give us the data, although that certainly would be a new 
 development, but we're obviously hopeful that's the case. The key question then will be whether what we get from him 
 this time is actually usable. If it's not, I think at that point it will make sense to just have BRG do it — they can physically 
 take the devices themselves and do it. We had asked about that possibility from the beginning and CART was resistant, 
 but given the past nine months I think we should do it if necessary. But, hopefully the intervention of higher-ups solves 
 the problem and we can get the data in the next couple weeks, which would be great.

 Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
 September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
 needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
 the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

 FYI, our NDO for the subpoenas we cut at the beginning of the case for Epstein's email accounts has expired, so they're 
 going to notify (unclear to me who they'll notify, of course). I have no problem with that, but let me know if you think

 Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
 can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
 levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
 week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
 the following loose storage devices: 
 o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
 o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
 o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
 o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
 o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
 The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
 The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 EFTA00031179
- The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to

 Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
 unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
 convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
 size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
 file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
 in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
 iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
 get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
 back was lacking.

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

 make sure we get all the info we need. I think you had previously sent us a list of certain information that unfortunately 
 wasn't helpful for us, so we want to make sure we're all on the same page. 
 In terms of data transfer, are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
 our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
 processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
 make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
 clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
 they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
 search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
 transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
 mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
 and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
 was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
 able to review them as well.) 
 many thanks,

 Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 EFTA00031188
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
 on the rest.

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
 to schedule a productive meeting. 
 thanks all,

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
 EFTA00031189
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 2. Khalilah asked me at the end of the day if we could send her a list of all admitted exhibits so far. I've checked my

 Guys — I think these are in great shape. The MILs were a major undertaking (on top of intense ongoing witness prep, 
 getting 3500 etc. out, and the various miscellaneous issues you've also had to fend off recently). I hope you can all take a

Subject: RE: SDNY investigation 
 Jill, Kyle, 
 Following up on our recent WebEx discussion, and with apologies for the slight delay, we wanted to get you a list of 
 initial categories of question that we think might assist in your discussion with your client, with the goal of then doing an 
 attorney proffer, or attorney summary, and discussing possible next steps. 
 We note that the below questions are simply general thoughts and suggestions—some may not need to be asked at all, 
 others may prompt follow-up from you in the moment, etc. In any interviews with us, we ordinarily are guided both by 
 the comfort level and the narrative of the witness, but we hope these give you a sense of what we would be interested 
 in. We also note that we included questions about sexual contact because it is our very general understanding from you 
 that abuse occurred, but we do not make any presumptions about what happened, if anything, separate from what your 
 client recalls. On that note, as we've discussed, but to reiterate, if there are any questions or topics your client is 
 uncomfortable addressing, there will be no pressure from us to do so, including at this early stage. 
 With those caveats, possible questions are below, and please let us know if it would be useful for us to chat again before 
 you talk with your client, or otherwise please let us know when it would next be appropriate to check in. 
 Questions / topics: 
 1) General background queries: Where did you grow up? How far did you go in school? What is your date of birth? 
 How generally would you describe your upbringing and early professional life? 
 2) How did you initially meet Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and how old were you at that time? What was the 
 nature of your work with them, and did the role change over time? How long did you work for Maxwell and/or 
 Epstein? 
 3) In general, what kinds of tasks did you perform for Maxwell or Epstein, and in what locations? Did you travel with 
 either of them? When you weren't traveling with them, where did you reside? Did you ever reside with Maxwell or 
 Epstein? If so, where — in what locations and at which properties? 
 4) Did there come a time when Epstein and/or Maxwell engaged in sexual contact with you? If so, how did that 
 happen the first time? Were there sexualized discussions or was there sexualized conduct leading up to any first 
 incident? 
 5) Were there other instances when you experienced sexual abuse or sexual contact while working for Maxwell? If so, 
 how did those incidents occur? Did they occur with Epstein alone, or was Maxwell ever directly involved in the 
 sexual contact? Did Maxwell ever observe, or was she present for, sexual contact that she herself was not 
 participating in? Were any other individuals present or participating? 
 6) Were you aware of any other girls or women who were subject to sexual abuse or contact by Epstein and/or 
 Maxwell, and if so, who? Did you ever see Epstein or Maxwell involved in sexual or other intimate contact with 
 other girls you believed or suspected may have been under the age of 18? And if so, under what circumstances 
 (when, where, etc.)? 
 7) How did your interactions with Epstein and Maxwell end? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you 
 when Epstein was under investigation in 2006-08? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you during 
 the New York investigation in 2018-20? If so, what was the nature of that contact? When is the last time you spoke 
 with or otherwise interacted with Epstein and/or Maxwell? 
 thank you,

 Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
 September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
 needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
 the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong. 
 EFTA00029778
Following up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the 
 thumb drive I received from yesterday with CART materials, NYCO27913 is not included, so we are still missing 
 that one. 
 But I do see that each of the items with the "Included next round" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, 
 with those items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. 
 In terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a 
 handful of them (approximately seven total, I think) — do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials 
 for any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? 
 And then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted 
 in gray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery. 
 thanks,

 Sony I didn't get back sooner. It's been kinda crazy. I'll answer your questions in order, so match them up. I'm

 The final items were given to She should have them. Reach out to her for delivery. 
 The 3 folders you mention contain supplemental files, doatirore them. 
 I am pretty sure NYC027913 is included with the items has. If not, please let me know. 
 As far as the old questions, you should have everything now. 
 The zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the 
 directory listings, but no actual content. It lists them as zero length files. 
 Need anything further, let me know.

 1. On this past Sunday and Monday, you had said you had you had additional materials you planned to get to us 
 on Monday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if 
 so, when can we get those materials?

2. There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on 
 the most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know 
 why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the 
 new folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already 
 received them. 
 3. One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc 
 you sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet). 
 In case it's useful, I'm attaching a version of the spreadsheet you put on the disc, but with all the items we received 
 folders for on the most recent hard drive highlighted in yellow.

 devices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: NYC024328 (row 10), 
 NYC024367 (row 62), and NYC027910 (row 96). Please confirm that these were added, and also that we're not 
 missing any? I believe those were all provided on the first disc. 
 5. As previously mentioned, the vendor has advised that in the initial seven devices provided, there were 
 approximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the second attached 
 spreadsheet. Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process?

 I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find 
 such files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be 
 comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items 
 in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to 
 get them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may 
 not be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me 
 know.

 Following up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the 
 thumb drive I received from yesterday with CART materials, NYC027913 is not included, so we are still missing 
 that one. 
 But I do see that each of the items with the "Included next round" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, 
 with those items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. 
 In terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a 
 handful of them (approximately seven total, I think) — do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials 
 for any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? 
 And then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted 
 in gray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery. 
 thanks,

 The final items were given to She should have them. Reach out to her for delivery. 
 The 3 folders you mention contain supplemental files, doat Imre them. 
 I am pretty sure NYCO27913 is included with the items has. If not, please let me know. 
 As far as the old questions, you should have everything now. 
 The zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the 
 directory listings, but no actual content. It lists them as zero length files. 
 Need anything further, let me know.

 why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the

MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00031228
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.

 they've been subjected."

 abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement

 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at 1-
 800 -CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated in 
 Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies 
 or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's 
 behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to 
 accept offers of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
 MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, 
 encouraging them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and susceptible 
 to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between minor victims 
 and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL was present 
 for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a 
 minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor 
 victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of a 
 victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch 
 Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and Epstein's 
 victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as 
 MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made false 
 statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex 
 acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00031235
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for

format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices —
 so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to 
 get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
 And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think we've 
 gotten any updates on that status in the past few weeks, and we're eager to be able to start reviewing.

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
 the following loose storage devices:

 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 EFTA00031244
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
 match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
 might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that.

 Great —two main comments: 
 1. A lot of questions about record keeping practices are about present practices, but I would guess things may have 
 been different in 1997, so you'll want to navigate that in your meeting with him and adjust the questions 
 accordingly. 
 2. The closing questions (after the record is in evidence) ask the witness to read out loud on the open record the 
 identifying information for MV1, so you'll need to adjust those.

 Attached is a draft Paul Kane Q&A. There are a couple questions that may seem weird — basically, since PCS didn't create 
 this record, the questions are aimed at a line of Second Circuit cases holding that "Records maintained but not created by 
 a company may be admissible as business records of that company if witnesses testify that the records are integrated into 
 [the] company's records and relied upon in its day-to-day operations." United States v. Kuthuru, 665 F. App'x 34, 39 (2d Cir. 
 2016). 
 Let's chat about the other hearsay issue when you have a minute?

 EFTA00031257
Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
 back was lacking.

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 The Government respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition to defendant 
 Michael Thomas's motion to compel discovery. (Dkt. No. 33) ("Mot."). Thomas seeks an order 
 compelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable 
 under any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas's motion is 
 entirely without merit and should be denied.' 
 Thomas concedes that the Government has produced a "multitude" of discovery directly 
 relevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the 
 Government to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his 
 purported defenses, namely, that he committed the offenses because of staffing issues and 
 supervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (i) a 
 copy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General 
 ("DOJ-OIG"), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary 
 materials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2019 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (ii) reports 
 and documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") and other agencies who were not and 
 are not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (iii) reports and documents related to "any 
 and all [Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC")] employees" who have engaged in "the same 
 or similar conduct," including an incident in "2005 or 2006" where officers failed to conduct 
 counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and 
 documents related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP 
 Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas's pretrial 
 motions. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(3) ("If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 
 12(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely. But a court may consider the defense, objection, or 
 request if the party shows good cause."). 
 EFTA00031268
policies which relate to the "much larger context" at the BOP (Mot. 6, 7, 9, 10). 
 As an initial matter, the Government has satisfied its Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio obligations 
 and is not in possession of the additional materials that Thomas seeks. More importantly, Thomas 
 is not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate 
 reasons. First, the records are not "material" to preparing a defense because they are wholly 
 irrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to 
 nullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the "possession" 
 of the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect 
 materials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were 
 not part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no 
 legal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-
 OIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to 
 discovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they "falsiflied] the same 
 documents," (Mot. 6), because he has utterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to 
 prosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. 
 Thomas's motion should be denied in all respects. 
 STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 I. The Indictment 
 Indictment 19 Cr. 830 (AT) (the "Indictment") was filed on November 19, 2019, charging 
 defendants Tova Noel and Michael Thomas in six counts: (i) conspiring to defraud the United 
 States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
 Section 371 (Count One); and (ii) five counts of making or using a false writing or document, in 
 violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 3 (Counts Two through Six). 
 2 
 EFTA00031269
Both defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged 
 in Counts Two and Three. The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period, 
 from approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day, 
 August 10, 2019, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As 
 charged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated 
 counts of prisoners housed in MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"), but nevertheless signed false 
 certifications attesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the 
 SHU were conducted from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 to 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
 II. Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants' Request for Additional Materials 
 A. The Government's Discovery Production 
 At the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2019, the Court set a discovery deadline 
 of December 31, 2019. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the 
 Government made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the 
 following: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by 
 Noel and Thomas from August 9 to 10, 2019; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC 
 phone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness 
 interviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") and the DOJ-OIG 
 who were participating in the investigation? 
 Subsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more 
 limited in scope. On January 23, 2020, the Government produced additional interview reports and 
 2 The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required 
 under Rule 16, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of 
 caution. 
 3 
 EFTA00031270
notes. On January 30, 2020,3 the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with 
 timestamps, and on March 16, 2020, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic 
 devices and a photograph of a text message. 
 B. Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials 
 The defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in 
 response to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with 
 Rule 16 and its other disclosure obligations, as described below. 
 At the initial pretrial conference on November 11, 2019, Thomas, through counsel, raised 
 the issue of an "ongoing . . . report" by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the 
 "status" of the report and when it would be completed.4 (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2019, at 3-4, 7-9). 
 In response, the Government explained that "to the extent counsel's asking for a summary of the 
 results of the criminal investigation, obviously we'll be turning over in discovery all of the 
 underlying results of the criminal investigation. . . I don't have a time frame on the ['inspector 
 [G]eneral report, but the [G]ovemment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery 
 materials in this matter, which includes the Rule 16 materials relevant to the criminal charges that 
 have been brought against the defendants." (Id. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve, 
 the Court declined to rule at that time. 
 On January 29, 2020, Thomas and Noel each submitted discovery requests to the 
 Government. Thomas's letter reiterated his prior request for "any and all reports, memorandums, 
 3 The January 30, 2020 production was made to Noel's counsel on January 24, 2020, while 
 the Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas's counsel. 
 4 Based on conversations with attorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the 
 Government understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of 
 Jeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures. 
 4 
 EFTA00031271
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the 
 United States Inspector General." Noel's January 29 letter sought materials related to the MCC 
 video surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating 
 particular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously 
 produced in discovery. 
 At the pretrial conference the following day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request 
 for "whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with 
 respect to the Inspector General's report." (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020, at 6, 9). The Court directed 
 Thomas to file a motion formalizing his request. (Id. at 9).5
 The Government responded to the defendants' discovery requests by letter dated March 
 14, 2020. As for Thomas's request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General's 
 report, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2019 
 pretrial conference. With respect to Noel's requests for additional materials related to the MCC 
 video surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the 
 Government's possession and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced. In 
 addition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel's questions, 
 including video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage. 
 On March 27, 2020, Thomas submitted another discovery request to the Government, 
 seeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and 
 information about the Government's charging decisions. The Government responded by letter 
 5 Thomas, through counsel, previewed that he would also likely file a motion to dismiss 
 the indictment based on "selective prosecution." (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020 at 6). The deadline for 
 filing motions, which was extended at counsel's request, has passed, and Thomas has failed to 
 timely file a motion to dismiss. 
 5 
 EFTA00031272
dated April I, 2020, explaining that any responsive information in the Government's possession 
 and subject to disclosure had already been produced. The letter further explained that to the extent 
 the requests called for items not in the Government's possession or not subject to disclosure, 
 Thomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was 
 not aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested 
 information. 
 On April 9, 2020, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court 
 compelling the Government to produce the following: 
 • The Inspector General's report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein 
 and BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the "Inspector 
 General's Report"), as well as all supporting memoranda and other 
 documents, (Mot. 4-5); 
 • Any and all "reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] regarding 
 the August 10, 2019 incident" as well as "documents, reports, witness 
 statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who 
 have engaged in the same or similar conduct," including "results of any 
 disciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding 
 the discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who 
 have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts," (Mot. 4, 6); 
 • Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents 
 created by "any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances 
 surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein," (Mot. 4, 7). 
 For the reasons that follow, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion 
 should be denied.

 EFTA00031273
ARGUMENT 
 1. Applicable Law 
 A. Brady & Giglio 
 The Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely 
 disclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See 
 Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); see also 
 United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d Cir. 2001). Evidence is "material" in this sense 
 only if "its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of a trial." United States v. Bagley, 
 473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985). "The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all 
 the evidence in the Government's possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of 
 his defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only 
 known to the Government." United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 610, 619 (2d Cir. 1982) (citing 
 United States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 604 (2d Cir. 1973)). 
 Impeachment evidence is material only "where the witness at issue supplied the only 
 evidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness's 
 credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution's case." United States v. 
 Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 1210 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
 Similarly, "where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to 
 challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or is subject to 
 extensive attack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as 
 cumulative, and hence not material." United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, 111 (2d Cir. 2011) 
 (citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit, 
 in Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a 
 7 
 EFTA00031274
demand for it. 267 F.3d at 146. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do 
 not require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant's request. Id. It 
 found that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence 
 as well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order 
 disclosure of material it deems material as a matter of case management. Id. As described above, 
 the Government disclosed reports and notes of witness statements as part of its discovery 
 productions, such that the defendants will have possessed substantial material that may serve as 
 potential impeachment evidence for one year in advance of trial. 
 B. Rule 16 
 Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Government to permit the 
 defendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government's possession, 
 custody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to 
 use them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant. 
 Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). An item is "material to preparing the defense" under Rule 16 "if it 
 could be used to counter the Government's case or bolster a defense." United States v. Stevens, 
 985 F.2d 1175, 1180-81 (2d Cir. 1993). 
 Il. Thomas is Not Entitled to Additional Materials 
 A. The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations 
 As an initial matter, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy 
 its discovery and disclosure obligations. 
 The Government has met its Rule 16 discovery and disclosure obligations. As set forth 
 above, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among 
 other things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2019 (despite the fact 
 8 
 EFTA00031275
that the Indictment relates to a 14-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and 
 staffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein's suicide; internal MCC phone 
 records; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written 
 Bureau of prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and 
 while not required by Rule 16, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and now, 
 approximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the 
 investigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants 
 disclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them. 
 The Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio 
 obligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably 
 exculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or 
 attorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the 
 Government intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in 
 advance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant's motion 
 should be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. 19 Cr. 123-2 (NRB), 2020 WL 1809293, at 
 *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (denying a motion to compel because the government "represented 
 that it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule 16 obligations); 
 United States v. Undenvood, No. 04 Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 
 2005) ("The courts of this Circuit repeatedly have denied pretrial requests for discovery orders 
 pursuant to Brady where the government has made such good faith representations."); United 
 States v. Perez, 940 F. Supp. 540, 553 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying defendant's motion to compel 
 production of Brady based on Government's representation that it was aware of and had complied 
 with Brady).

 EFTA00031276
B. The Requested Records Are Not "Material" to Preparing a Defense and Are 
 Sought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification 
 All of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not "material to preparing a defense" 
 under Rule 16, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the 
 Government's false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks 
 evidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies, 
 supervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he 
 can engage in attempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions "led" to the criminal 
 conduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, 14). Thomas is not 
 entitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—
 that would aid in that nullification effort because Rule 16 only entitles a defendant to discovery 
 for purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government's case in chief, not the merits of the 
 decision to prosecute. 
 1. Applicable Law 
 An item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is 
 discoverable under Rule 16(a)(1)(E) only if it "is material to preparing the defense." Fed. R. Crim. 
 P. 16(a)(1)(E). "It is [a defendant's] burden to make a prima facie showing that documents sought 
 under Rule 16(a)(1)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense." United States v. Rigas, 258 F. 
 Supp. 2d 299, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 894 
 (S.D.N.Y. 1991)). As noted above, an item is "material to preparing the defense" under Rule 16 
 "if it could be used to counter the Government's case or bolster a defense." Stevens, 985 F.2d at 
 1180-81. The defendant must "offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested 
 evidence is material." Rigas, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 307 (internal citation omitted).

 In terms of data transfer, are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on

defendants to examine records "material to the preparation of their defense against the 
 Government's case in chief," it does not authorize discovery for defenses that do not rebut the 
 "merits to the criminal charge itself." 517 U.S. 456, 462-63 (1996) (holding that Rule 16 does not 
 authorize discovery relating to a selective prosecution claim). For that reason, because evidence 
 that would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification does not relate to the merits of 
 the criminal charges, it is not discoverable under Rule 16. Id.; see also United States v. Defreitas, 
 No. 07 Cr. 543 (DLI), 2011 WL 317964, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2011) (rejecting discovery 
 request related to something that is "not a defense" and has "nothing to do with the issues of 
 whether defendants ... committed the ... crimes charged"). Since jury nullification is "a practice 
 whereby a juror votes in purposeful disregard of the evidence," United States v. Thomas, 116 F.3d 
 606, 614 (2d Cir. 1997), or "out of compassion or compromise," Standefer v. United States, 447 
 U.S. 10, 22 (1980) (internal citation omitted), it is not error for a court to preclude evidence that is 
 "not a valid defense" aimed at nullification, United States v. Edwards, 101 F.3d 17, 19-20 (2d Cir. 
 1996). See also United States v. Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d 579, 583-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (precluding 
 defense arguments or evidence related to "possible consequences for the defendant of conviction, 
 jury nullification, and the Government's motive and conduct in prosecuting [defendant]"); United 
 States v. Levin, No. 15 Cr. 101 (KBF), 2016 WL 299031, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2016) (barring 
 evidence "intended to elicit sympathy" and attempts to "use jury nullification as a defense" as 
 "plainly improper"). Indeed, "trial courts have the duty to forestall or prevent jury nullification" 
 even where the defendant or the court may "strongly disagree[] with the government's charging 
 decisions and the attendant sentencing consequences." United States v. Manzano, 945 F.3d 616, 
 626-27 (2d Cir. 2019) (citations & quotation marks omitted).

 EFTA00031278
2. Discussion 
 Thomas's motion makes clear that he intends for his principal defense at trial to be that—
 irrespective of his guilt or innocence of the false statements charges—he should be acquitted 
 because the MCC was understaffed, Thomas was overworked, his supervisors did not catch his 
 crime in the moment, and falsification of count slips is rampant within the BOP. (See Mot. 3 
 ("staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP 
 procedures go to the heart of his defense to the government's criminal allegations"); 9 ("Mr. 
 Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2019 led 
 to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is now criminally charged.")). Thomas has failed to meet 
 his burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid 
 defense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead 
 would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification. 
 The purported reasons for Thomas's decision to falsify count slips—being tired, 
 overworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those 
 issues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas 
 intentionally made materially false statements and also that did so while tired or overworked, it 
 would still be required to convict him. See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 213,221 (2d Cir. 2005) 
 (holding that "it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the 
 defendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense 
 with which he was charged" (internal citation omitted)). 
 None of Thomas's proffered excuses relate to proving or rebutting the elements of a 
 violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false, 
 whether it was material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knowingly 
 12 
 EFTA00031279
and willfully made a false statement. Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a 
 criminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant's purportedly 
 innocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States 
 v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent 
 motive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is "knowingly and willfully"); In re Terrorist 
 Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, 154 n.49 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Washington, 
 705 F.2d at 493, for "the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional"); 
 United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. 1992) (rejecting the defendant's "context 
 argument" for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged). 
 For the same reasons, "other people were doing it" is not a defense to a false statements or 
 conspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the 
 foregoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees 
 falsified records and "their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration," evidence of 
 what other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas 
 believed falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the 
 charges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 760 F.2d 1366, 1372 (2d Cir. 1985) 
 ("Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action."); United 
 States v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 601 n.2 (3d Cir. 1972) ("As long as the inexcusable intent is 
 present, it is not necessary that the defendant know that his conduct is subject to criminal 
 penalties."). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial, 
 for the July to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged 
 here, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant. See United States v. Gibbons, 602 F.2d 
 1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who 
 13 
 EFTA00031280
were not on trial). 
 Thomas's efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for 
 his own criminal actions plainly sound in nullification. See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84; 
 Levitt, 2016 WL 2990831, at *12. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the 
 defendant committed the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or 
 compromise from the jury. The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the 
 nullification evidence precluded in Armstrong and its progeny. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 462-
 63 (defendant not entitled to discovery on race of other narcotics defendants to aid in selective 
 prosecution claim); United States v. Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *4 
 (S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2015) (rejecting defendant's "demands for general information and statistics 
 relating to the Government's use of sting operations"); United States v. Floyd, No. 99 Cr. 0234 
 (DAB), 1999 WL 476438, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 1999) (rejecting discovery request for 
 "background data, records and investigative reports" of the New York City Police Department 
 ("NYPD") as well as information about NYPD officers' conduct in other cases); Defreitas, 2011 
 WL 317964, at *10 (rejecting discovery demands related to a "factual impossibility" defense to a 
 conspiracy charge). It is the Court's "duty to forestall or prevent" jury nullification. Manzano, 
 945 F.3d at 627 (holding that "District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification 
 arguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could 
 argue jury nullification."); see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
 (criticizing trial court for inviting nullification by permitting the defendants to mount a "political 
 defense" and stating that it was an "erroneous assumption that good motive for committing a crime 
 is inconsistent with criminal intent"). 
 In sum, much of the additional discovery Thomas seeks in his motion relates to legally 
 14 
 EFTA00031281
irrelevant matters, such as what "led" him to the criminal conduct or the broader "context" in 
 which he committed specific criminal acts. There is no basis to compel production of evidence 
 related to those matters under Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because 
 the evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent attempt at nullification. Thomas's motion 
 should be denied on this basis alone. 
 C. The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who 
 Were Not Part of the Prosecution Team 
 Thomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce "any reports, witness 
 statements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the 
 BOP," "documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC 
 employees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct," and any previously undisclosed 
 reports, witness statements, and documents created by "any other federal agencies that investigated 
 the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein." (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)). Even 
 if Thomas had satisfied the materiality requirement under Rule 16 or Brady with respect to these 
 items —and he has not—Thomas's motion would still fail because the materials he seeks are not 
 in the prosecution team's possession. 
 The BOP is not, and never has been, part of the prosecution team. Nor did the BOP conduct 
 an investigation jointly or in coordination with the prosecution team.° To require the Government 
 to obtain and produce any records from the BOP from a separate investigation, as well as evidence 
 that would support Thomas's purported (and improper, for the reasons discussed in Part II.B, 
 6 The defendant claims, based on a CNN article, that the U.S. Marshal Service ("USMS") 
 conducted an investigation. The Government is unaware of such an investigation, and in any 
 event, any such inquiry by the USMS was not conducted jointly or in coordination with the 
 prosecution team. 
 15 
 EFTA00031282
supra) defenses, is not legally required and would impose a nearly insurmountable obligation on 
 the Government of marshaling and reviewing information and data in the possession of an entirely 
 separate entity. 
 1. Applicable Law 
 As described above, Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government's 
 "possession." As a general matter, while lain individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have 
 knowledge of all information gathered in connection with his office's investigation of the 
 case, ... knowledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does 
 not in all instances warrant the imputation of knowledge to the prosecutor." United States v. 
 Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). The imposition of such "an 
 unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor's office 
 on the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government' 
 that would 'condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis." Id. (citation & 
 quotation marks omitted); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995) (Government's 
 discovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor 
 or "others acting on the government's behalf in the case"). Thus, discovery and disclosure 
 obligations only extend "information known to persons who are a part of the 'prosecution 
 team' ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of 
 the case," including "police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the 
 prosecutor and participate in the investigation." United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App'x 36, 38 (2d 
 Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information 
 in the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 
 16 
 EFTA00031283
56, 112 (2d Cir. 2003) (defendants were not deprived of due process by any alleged failure of U.S. 
 government to help them obtain cooperation from foreign authorities). 
 In considering whether Rule 16 and Brady apply to records in the possession of another 
 government agency, a prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing such evidence only where the 
 Government conducts a "joint investigation" with that agency or branch of government. See 
 United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming district court opinion holding that 
 there was "no joint investigation with the [Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")]" and 
 therefore the Government did not need to produce documents in the custody of the SEC); United 
 States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 742-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that the Government 
 was not obligated to review SEC material for Brady where SEC was not involved in grand jury 
 presentation, did not attend every interview, did not review documents gathered only by 
 prosecution, and did not develop prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 
 36 (JPO), 2018 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (holding that the Government was 
 not required to conduct a search because the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
 ("PCAOB")] was not involved in witness interviews or developing prosecutorial strategy, and the 
 SEC was not involved in the grand jury presentation, reviewing the fruits of the Government's 
 investigation, or developing prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 
 241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (no joint investigation between Government and SEC); United States v. 
 Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Chin, J.) (no joint investigation between 
 Government and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")); United States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 
 727, 749-50 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (holding that USAO and Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") 
 did not conduct a "joint investigation" even though the FAA provided two inspectors to assist the 
 criminal investigation). 
 17 
 EFTA00031284
Moreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an 
 investigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team. See, e.g., 
 United States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 720, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ("While the prosecution's [Rule 
 16] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knowledge 
 of the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knowledge of 
 the entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned."); United 
 States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 218 (3d Cir. 2005) ("[T]hat other agents in the ([Department of 
 Labor ("DOL")] participated in this investigation does not mean that the entire DOL is properly 
 considered part of the prosecution team."); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 949 (2d 
 Cir.1993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to impute to AUSAs prosecuting that action with the 
 assistance of certain FBI agents knowledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were 
 "uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants"); but see United States v. Ghailani, 687 
 F. Supp. 2d 365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other 
 members of the Department of Justice who were involved in making decisions about timing and 
 progress of the case were part of the "government" for Rule 16 purposes). 
 Thus, as the foregoing precedents recognize, the factors relevant in determining whether 
 an agency or a component of an agency are part of the prosecution team, and therefore their records 
 are in the "possession" of the Government include whether the agency or component: "(1) 
 participated in the prosecution's witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the 
 grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4) 
 played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to 
 court proceedings." Middendorf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4. 
 18 
 EFTA00031285
2. Discussion 
 As described above, the Government has produced Brady, Giglio, and Rule 16 material in 
 the possession of the prosecutors and agents at the United States Attorney's Office, the FBI, and 
 the DOJ-OIG who have worked on this investigation and prosecution. Thomas seeks materials 
 that are not in the possession of the United States Attorney's Office or the case teams at the FBI 
 and DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation. 
 Thomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the 
 prosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic 
 decisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the 
 MCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and written 
 requests to the MCC's legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any 
 internal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's suicide. Notwithstanding 
 those facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is "allied with the prosecution" and therefore the 
 Government's discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the 
 possession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is settled law in this 
 Circuit that a prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or 
 control of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a "joint 
 investigation" with that agency. None of the indicia of a "joint" or "allied" prosecution, as 
 discussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors 
 considered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did 
 not participate in the prosecution's witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case 
 to the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the 
 19 
 EFTA00031286
Government; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel 
 accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings. 
 Moreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into 
 the events of August 9 and 10, 2019 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe 
 that most if not all of the records that he seeks-such as records of other instances of BOP 
 employees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP's investigation. There 
 is simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the 
 possession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case, 
 regarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct 
 required rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other 
 times also allegedly falsified records. 
 The cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the 
 Ninth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents 
 located in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS 
 investigation. 868 F.2d 1032, 1035-37 (9th Cir. 1989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit 
 explained that "a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might 
 have documents regarding the defendant" and that Rule 16's disclosure requirements are cabined 
 to anything in the possession "of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the 
 defendant." Id. at 1036 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 
 204, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), the court explained, in denying the defendant's discovery motion, that 
 "[c]ourts have construed the term `government' . . . narrowly to mean the prosecutors in the 
 particular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant, 
 and not the 'government' in general." And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp.

2d I, 9 (D.D.C. 2006), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice 
 President and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not 
 participate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited 
 by another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit. 
 Finally, even if such materials had any conceivable relevance to the charges at hand (which, 
 as discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the 
 BOP's records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of 
 documents, attempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2005, and parsing through 
 attorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for attorneys for 
 the Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knows 
 of no effective way to search them. It would, as the Circuit warned against in Avellino, "condemn 
 the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis." 136 F.3d at 255. Such a result is not 
 legally required by Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas's motion should be denied. 
 D. Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to Disclosure 
 Thomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be 
 produced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP, 
 including purported staffing shortages at the MCC. (Mot. 5,9-10). For the reasons set forth above, 
 any draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will 
 discuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports, 
 to the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege. While 
 the prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the 
 Government understands that those attorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report 
 have not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term. As 
 21 
 EFTA00031288
such, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas's motion can be denied on that 
 reason alone. Moreover, Thomas's request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet 
 exist -fails for two additional reasons. 
 First, drafts of the Inspector General's Report, which has not been completed and will 
 likely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the 
 deliberative process privilege, which "covers `documents reflecting advisory opinions, 
 recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions 
 and policies are formulated.'" Dep't of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass 'n, 532 
 U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)). The 
 privilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United 
 States v. Fernandez, 231 F.3d 1240, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2000) (government's death penalty 
 evaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative 
 process privilege); In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737-40 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (indicating that the 
 privilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284 
 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). "In order for the privilege to apply, 
 the agency record at issue must be (1) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter; (2) 
 pre -decisional; and (3) deliberative." Nat? Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envd. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d 
 150, 155 (2d Cir. 2020). "It is well-settled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically 
 pre -decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors; 
 views that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their 
 superiors." Color of Change v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2018) (quoting Amnesty Intl USA v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)). 
 The Inspector General's Report is both pre-decisional and deliberative. A full draft has not 
 22 
 EFTA00031289
been completed, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public. 
 It is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those 
 recommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being 
 finalized and publicly announced. Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in 
 reaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these 
 discussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure 
 of any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine 
 the DOJ-OIG's ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to 
 inmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on 
 the issues. Accordingly, Thomas's motion should be denied for the reason that the materials 
 sought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. 
 Second, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector 
 General's Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials 
 upon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure. To the extent that the forthcoming 
 Inspector General's Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and 
 prosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and 10, 
 2019, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed 
 to the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may "possibl[y]" 
 have generated additional witness statements and "other information" that has not been produced 
 by the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides 
 mere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based attorneys who are 
 preparing the Inspector General's Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution's 
 understanding that those attorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise 
 23 
 EFTA00031290
discovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced 
 in discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG attorneys preparing the Report, the 
 underlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants' 
 possession. Any analysis of those materials by the attorneys preparing the Inspector General's 
 Report is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule 16 and cannot constitute Brady material. See 
 United States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d 148, 150 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting generally that "nothing contained 
 in [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable"). 
 At bottom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft, 
 unpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not 
 required by Rule 16, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation. 
 E. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material 
 in Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim 
 Thomas seeks "information and statistics that show the conduct in which the defendant is 
 being charged with a crime were . . rampant throughout the BOP" and that the application of 
 criminal laws to him is "possibl[y] discriminatory." (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a 
 demand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only 
 for the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite 
 showing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas 
 has failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or 
 discriminatory purpose. 
 1. Applicable Law 
 "A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, 
 but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by 
 the Constitution." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is "a demanding 
 24 
 EFTA00031291
one," id., as the defendant must "overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of 
 federal prosecutors, and `in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they 
 have properly discharged their official duties.'" United States v. Sanders, 17 F. Supp. 2d 141, 144 
 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464), aff'd, 211 F.3d 711 (2d Cir. 2000). 
 A defendant claiming selective prosecution must present "clear evidence" that the decision 
 to prosecute not only (1) "had a discriminatory effect" but was also (2) "motivated by a 
 discriminatory purpose." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 173 
 (2d Cir. 2003); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1992); United States v. Moon, 718 
 F.2d 1210, 1229 (2d Cir. 1983). "The discriminatory effect prong requires a showing that 
 `similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted."' Alameh, 341 
 F.3d at 173 (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must show that 
 he has been "singled out" as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon, 
 718 F.2d at 1229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must show that the 
 Government's discriminatory "selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in 
 bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to 
 prevent his exercise of constitutional rights." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration 
 incorporated). Where a defendant "has not shown that the Government prosecuted him because 
 of his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. Id. 
 In order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer 
 "some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense." 
 Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974)); 
 United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2002) (per curiam) (to obtain discovery, a defendant 
 accordingly first "must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory 
 25 
 EFTA00031292
intent"); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). "[T]he showing necessary to obtain discovery should itself 
 be a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. 
 "Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient" to meet this 
 burden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 470 (affidavits "recotmt[ing] 
 hearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence" are not sufficient to 
 justify discovery); Berrios, 501 F.2d at 1211 (affidavit from defendant and attorney that they 
 "believe[d]" there was improper motive and that "hundreds" of similarly situated individuals went 
 unprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 341 F.3d at 174 (defendant's statistical analysis was 
 insufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim). 
 2. Discussion 
 Thomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or 
 "discriminatory application" claim. He has not carried his burden through a showing of any 
 evidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory. 
 As to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any 
 evidence that "others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of 
 conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him]." Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal 
 quotation marks omitted). "A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who 
 has committed roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom 
 the law has not been enforced." United States v. Lewis, 517 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 2008). Thomas 
 alleges that there was an "almost identical incident in 2005 or 2006 wherein officers failed to 
 conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide," and one of the four 
 officers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to 
 conduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming 
 26 
 EFTA00031293
those officers "in 2005 or 2006" did falsify count slips, Thomas has still not put forth any evidence 
 that those officers were "outside of the protected class," meaning of a different race, gender, 
 nationality, or other protected class than Thomas. In any event, even were the conduct similar, 
 that Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally 
 prosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness. 
 Similarly, Thomas points to the fact that "Officer-1" and "Officer-2" in the Indictment, 
 who falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. institutional counts on 
 August 9, 2019, respectively, were not prosecuted. (Mot. 10; Ind. ¶' 15, 17, 19). Even assuming 
 arguendo that Officer-1 and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified 
 one count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that 
 either Officer-1 or Officer-2 were outside of a "protected class" to which Thomas belongs.? Nor 
 could he: Officer-1 and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas 
 also questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas's 
 false count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or 
 personnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false 
 statements —Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the "suspicion [and] 
 surmise" contained in Thomas's motion simply do not constitute "objective evidence" warranting 
 discovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir. 1992) (conclusory allegations as to 
 timing of indictment, Government's failure to follow internal guidelines, and improprieties of 
 7 In so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or 
 the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas's 
 claim that the lack of charges against Officer-1, Officer-2, or Thomas's supervisors is in and of 
 itself sufficient to meet the defendant's burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated 
 defendant who was not charged. 
 27 
 EFTA00031294
prosecutors not "objective evidence" warranting discovery); Moon, 718 F.2d at 1230 ("to engage 
 in a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or 
 surmise"). Thomas's failure to make an evidentiary showing in support of the first required prong 
 means that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g., 
 Bass, 536 U.S. at 863. 
 As to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that 
 the decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a 
 showing, a defendant must establish that the Government's "selection of the defendant for 
 prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations 
 as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights." Fares, 978 F.2d at 
 59 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any 
 evidence whatsoever that the Government's decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything 
 other than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government's decision to prosecute him at 
 all, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is 
 "rampant" within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for 
 committing the crime that Thomas committed does not mean that the Government harbored 
 discriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.8
 8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has 
 failed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective 
 prosecution before a jury because the "selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather 
 than the jury." Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082. The Second Circuit's directive makes sense. A claim of 
 improper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, "is not a defense on the merits to 
 the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge 
 for reasons forbidden by the Constitution." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-
 evidently "unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged," which is the sole issue to be 
 decided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution. 
 Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
 (criticizing admission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution "for turning the trial away 
 28 
 EFTA00031295
Having failed to meet the "rigorous standard" required to obtain discovery on a selective 
 prosecution defense, Thomas's requests for discovery of any materials related to other incidents 
 in which officers were not prosecuted for falsifying count slips should be denied. Armstrong, 517 
 U.S. at 464. 
 CONCLUSION 
 For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion to compel should be denied.

 reasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into matters far beyond the scope of legitimate issues

 these arguments at trial. See Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082 ("[W]e agree with the district court's

 from presenting evidence on that subject."); United States v. Raniere, No. 18 Cr. 204 (NGG), Dkt.

 Subject: (EXTERNAL) FBI Still Needing Tips Regarding Jeffrey Epstein / Ghislaine Maxwell? 
 Dear Ms. MI 
 I feel Jeffrey Epstein &/or Ghislaine Maxwell reached out tome, in July 2019, (around the time he was apprehended) via 
 Seeking Arrangements (probably just "Seeking" these days.) It was a brief communication out of Palm Beach, but it was 
 right to the point. The person/people wanted me to be a recruiter and they basically wanted to know if it seemed 
 appealing to go out partying and "bring home girls to Daddy." This notion seemed wholly cringeworthy with ick-factor 
 and I don't think I replied in any fashion. 
 It may be worth the while for the FBI to subpoena Seeking Arrangements' records out of Palm Beach. I feel extremely 
 confident that Maxwell &/or Epstein were actively using this platform for recruiting. I think they were attracted to me, 
 because my profile pics looked like her...we could pass for family. 
 From what you know, is this tidbit important? Does the FBI know about the Seeking Arrangement connection? Should I 
 be conveying this information to anyone in particular? I'm sort of afraid to become involved, but I also feel everything 
 should be done so justice can help the young victims. 
 Thank you,

 (NY) 
 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
 clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
 they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
 Spreadsheet is attached.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00031323
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The

 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00031324
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 EFTA00031326
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
 search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
 transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
 mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
 and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
 was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
 able to review them as well.)

 Laura, 
 Below please find responses to the issues you raised: 
 • We are confirmed for the review at the Bronx warehouse on April 12, 2021 from 11am to 4:30pm. 
 • During the April 12th review, your team can see the evidence for yourselves and let me know if you need any of the 
 items you are not permitted to photograph to be brought to 500 Pearl. Depending on the size of the item(s), we 
 may need to figure out whether they can be brought later in the week once you have already reviewed several 
 boxes, which would free up space in the FBI vehicle for the larger items. I'm confident we will be able to reach a 
 reasonable agreement about those items. 
 • For the bulky photos, you will not be permitted to photograph any that feature nudity. As referenced above, once 
 your team has seen those photos for yourselves, you can let me know if you will need any to be brought to 500 
 Pearl. 
 • As I mentioned previously and is indicated in the spreadsheet, we are preparing a letter to defense counsel 
 explaining why you will not be permitted to review those 16 discs. We expect to send you that letter tomorrow, 
 after which I will be happy to discuss the matter further. 
 • The blue-ray discs referenced in the spreadsheet are what the FBI burned in order to provide the USAO SDNY with 
 a copy of electronic data to produce to you in discovery. The discs are not evidence themselves. The data is the 
 evidence, and it was produced to you already. You are correct, however, that the 4/24/07 file is a data file that was 
 copied from a VHS tape, which is currently located in the FBI's ELSUR office in Florida. We have asked that the 
 original tape be shipped to New York, and it should arrive on Tuesday, April 13th. We will make it available for you 
 to review once we have received it. We also plan to produce the digital file of that same recording to you as part of 
 our productions of non-testifying witness statements. 
 • The shredded paper is currently being analyzed by the FBI lab. We have asked the case agent to inquire with the 
 lab regarding its anticipated timeline for analysis and will let you know when we expect it will be possible to have 
 the shredded paper returned to New York for you to review. It will not, however, be available next week. 
 • The "Missing from Assigned Box" items are items 111130 and 1B110. Those items were migrated within the FBI 
 evidence system from the Florida case to the New York case and incorporated into New York evidence item 
 numbers 18127, 1B128, & 16137. So these items will be available for your review under those New York evidence 
 numbers.

 My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
 for the logistics. 
 Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
 First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
 Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
 NY Evidence List 
 • Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
 • Item 1B13 (1 box) 
 Florida Evidence List 
 • Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
 Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
 photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
 Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
 those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
 Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
 physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
 Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
 recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
 files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
 which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
 date. 
 Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
 EFTA00031333
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
 I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
 agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
 resolve any of them as needed this week. 
 Thank you,

 Hi Laura, 
 The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
 building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
 attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
 AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
 The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
 week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
 review.

 Good morning, 
 Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
 VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
 I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
 can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
 Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
 thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
 at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
 the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th• I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
 logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
 To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
 previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
 detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
 • These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
 see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
 able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
 spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
 about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
 • These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
 we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
 available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
 to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
 opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
 the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
 and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
 statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
 to produce for you to review. 
 Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
 at the Bronx warehouse.

 Laura, 
 EFTA00031336
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
 modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
 • The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
 Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
 that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
 next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
 have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
 • Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
 500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
 will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
 as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
 may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
 photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
 portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
 • In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
 segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
 witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
 not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
 contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
 review the original recordings themselves. 
 • In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
 will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
 500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
 private meeting space for the defense team. 
 • Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
 2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
 MDC. 
 • Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
 As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
 13 th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
 produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
 Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
 yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
 whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
 to schedule a productive meeting. 
 thanks all,

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
 • For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
 exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
 to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
 devices and "fragile" items. 
 o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
 inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
 of these same items are insufficient. 
 o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
 which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
 inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
 consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
 o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
 warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
 Court. 
 • For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
 seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
 contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
 outside of those recordings. 
 • As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
 is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
 courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
 for inspection. 
 • We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
 appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
 • We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
 disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
 available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
 • We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
 Street. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
 scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
 Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
 arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
 also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
 Physical Evidence 
 • It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
 certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
 preparation of her defense. 
 • We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
 o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
 of transport. 
 o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
 Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
 o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
 productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
 seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
 cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
 o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
 to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
 from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
 o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
 include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
 to you from the search of the New York residence. 
 • The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
 would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
 • Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
 player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
 recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
 equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
 understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
 produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
 not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
 we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
 that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
 • The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
 confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
 • We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
 review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
 cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
 the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
 • As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
 AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
 of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
 proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
 EFTA00031339
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
 we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
 defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
 consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
 • The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
 cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
 that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
 above -listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
 images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
 these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
 office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
 • We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
 be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
 defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
 from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

 All, 
 We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
 case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
 First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
 which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
 physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
 Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
 own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
 which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
 In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
 EFTA00031340
Physical Evidence 
 • All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
 and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
 accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
 o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
 pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
 photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
 o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
 with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
 o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
 and where they are. 
 • We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
 from Judge Nathan to do so. 
 • Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
 bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
 of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
 March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
 • The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
 confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
 we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
 we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
 review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
 basis. 
 • The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
 view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
 leave of the Court in advance. 
 • We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
 Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
 separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
 government. 
 • Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
 below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
 discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
 • Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
 understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
 for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
 located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
 • During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
 defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
 confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
 previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
 Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
 Thank you.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 < 
 All, 
 Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
 discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
 In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
 Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
 • There are three categories of these images: 
 o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
 been previously provided to you) 
 o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
 previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
 o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
 Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
 • The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
 and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
 o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
 be viewed using Cellebrite. 
 o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
 devices. 
 o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
 image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
 other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
 o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
 to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
 • Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
 there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
 to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
 Regarding the physical evidence: 
 • Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
 associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
 FBI New York office's current investigation. 
 • The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
 items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
 Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
 you will have all evidence in one place. 
 • The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
 following conditions: 
 o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
 place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
 o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
 o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
 o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
 To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
 EFTA00031342
to be physically present for this review. 
 o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
 may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
 the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
 are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
 presence of nudity. 
 o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
 • To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
 the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
 items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
 Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
 necessary. 
 • The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
 single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
 that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
 anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
 downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
 o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
 residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
 your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
 all of those discs. 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
 when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
 At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
 Thanks, 
 Laura

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 EFTA00031344
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
 Thank you,

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

 Counsel, 
 In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 Could I ask you to please cover those? Or if any issues I can also try to move one or more of them, too. And I should be

I knew Ghislaine Maxwell for over 10 years. It was her calculating 
 and sadistic manipulation that anaesthetized me, in order to 
 deliver me, with full knowledge of the heinous and 
 dehumanizing abuse that awaited me, straight to the hands of 
 Jeffrey Epstein. Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have done 
 what he did. She was in charge. She egged him on and 
 encouraged him. She told me of others she recruited, and she 
 thought it was funny. She pretends to care, only to garner 
 sympathy and enjoys drawing her victims in with perceived 
 caring, only to entrap them and make them feel some sense of 
 obligation to her through emotional manipulation. She was the 
 predator and a monster. 
 The sociopathic manner in which she nurtured our relationship, 
 abused my trust and took advantage of my vulnerability, makes 
 it clear to me that she would have done anything to get what she 
 wanted, to satisfy Mr. Epstein. I have great fear that Ghislaine 
 Maxwell will flee, since she has demonstrated, over many years, 
 her sole purpose is that of self-preservation. She blatantly 
 disregards and disrespects the judicial system, as demonstrated 
 by her perjuring herself and bullying anyone who dared accuse 
 her. 
 I have great fear that she may seek to silence those whose 
 testimony is instrumental in her prosecution. In fact, when I was 
 listed as a witness in a civil action involving Maxwell, I received a 
 phone call in the middle of the night, threatening my then 2-year 
 old's life if I testified.

I have fear speaking here today, even anonymously. However, I 
 have chosen to implore the court not grant bond for Ms. 
 Maxwell because I know the truth. I know what she has done, I 
 know how many lives she has ruined and because I know this, I 
 know she has nothing to lose, has no remorse and will never 
 admit what she has done. 
 Please do not let us down by allowing her the opportunity to 
 further hurt her victims, or evade the consequences that surely 
 await her if justice is served. If she believes she risks prison, she 
 will never come back. If she is out, I need to be protected. I 
 personally know her international connections, that would allow 
 her to go anywhere in the world and disappear at a moment's 
 notice, or make others disappear, if she needs to.

 I'm in the proffer and do not have the disc with me. If I'm not mistaken may still be in NJ. If I finish up 
 over here earlier then expected I'll ran back and grab it.

 For the first question, the AUSAs contacted the attorneys we were aware of who represented victims to tell them that 
 their clients were welcome to attend and to make a statement. I believe also sent out notifications, and hopefully 
 she can tell us how many she sent. 
 For the second question, based on my review of the transcript (attached), a total of 17 victims were present at the hearing 
 and either spoke at the hearing or had someone read a statement for them. An additional 7 did not attend the hearing 
 but had someone else speak for them or read a statement from them. It is possible there were others present who were 
 not referenced on the record. 
 I don't think we can answer the third question. I don't recall anyone off the top of my head who wanted to attend but 
 was unable to, but it's possible there were some in that position.

 The Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of their issues is the 
 District Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to "have their day in court." The 
 Court's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has 
 alleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing 
 because they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY. 
 EFTA00031395
Can your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about 
 making a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim 
 impact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but 
 were unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing? 
 Please provide as much of this information as possible today. I'm very sorry for the quick turnaround but

 and I were doing parallel work and she beat me to it, but in case it's helpful, in addition to the individuals who 
 spoke or were present for their letters being read (10 identified by name and 7 Jane Does), Brad Edwards stated that he 
 had 15 clients present (eight of whom spoke) and "at least 20 more who didn't make this hearing today for a multitude of 
 reasons." (Tr. at 29). And I similarly don't recall anyone who expressed directly to us that they wanted to attend but 
 couldn't, with the exception of jjj, as jj, mentioned. 
 Also to the extent it's helpful, the Tuesday, August 27 hearing was ordered on Wednesday, August 21, and that day we 
 posted the following general notification to the case page on our Office's website: 
 August 21, 2019 update: 
 On August 21, 2019, a hearing was ordered by the Court in the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 
 (RMB). The hearing is in connection with the nolle prosequi order proposed to the Court on August 19, 2019, by the 
 United States Attorney, following the death of defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At the hearing, counsel for the victims and 
 the victims will be heard, if they wish to be. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, August 27, 2019, at 10:30 a.m. 
 before the Honorable Richard M. Berman, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, Daniel

 Thanks, I appreciate the concern and am open to working to address it, to the extent possible. We, of course, 
 would never simply turn this material over to a civil litigant, as you suggest. The problem is, irrespective of our intent, this 
 is not Rule 6 material (unless, of course, he testifies before a grand jury), and we are trying to be mindful of not simply our 
 criminal case, but obligations we may have under other aspects of U.S. law, FOIA and/or Touhy, spring to mind, for 
 example. Again, we never voluntarily turn this stuff over, and we frequently oppose FOIA requests and the like to the 
 extent we can under the law. But particularly given the history and concern, we don't want to make promises we may not 
 be able to keep. 
 Do you by any chance have handy a copy of the MLAT itself (if not, certainly happy to locate myself, just figured you might 
 have it already). I'd like to see what, if anything, the treaty says about this subject.

 Thanks. This is helpful. One clarification which they will seek - because it seems to loom 
 large in their suspicions - is whether his statement will be provided to victims for purposes 
 of civil litigation. I know this is not something that ordinarily happens (I don't think I have 
 ever done this) - but I think we need to say something about that to move this forward. 
 Maybe something like, "Absent a court order directing otherwise, the SDNY will not use or 
 disclose the statement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or 
 related asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government."

 returns on the USAO's FTP site, called USAFX. Carpenter and Gildea already have access to USAFX. For everyone else, 
 you'll need an account which is very easy. Will can help you get an account — I think he'll just need your cellphone

ININ Thanks for your patience. I've now had a chance to raise your suggestion on our end, and we are amenable to 
 discussing a confidentiality agreement along the lines you propose, with some revisions. Below is our proposed language 
 which we would be comfortable with. Happy to discuss our position further at your convenience. Thanks, Ted 
 Prior to the in-person interview: 
 From now until August 14, 2020, neither the witness nor any person representing him will 
 make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the plans for or terms of the 
 interview. Likewise, the SDNY agrees to make no public comment about the matter during this 
 period. If an interview has not been concluded by August 14, this confidentiality agreement 
 will not bar any further public or private comments on the matter. 
 After an in-person interview: 
 If the witness completes an interview with U.S. law enforcement, both parties may confirm 
 publicly or privately that: "the witness has met with law enforcement authorities in the United 
 States and answered questions about matters under investigation. We will not comment 
 further." Further comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking for him will 
 void this agreement. 
 The content of the witness's statements to law enforcement as part of any interview arranged 
 pursuant to the MLA will only be used or disclosed as permitted under U.S. law, including in 
 connection with a criminal investigation or proceeding, as ordered or authorized by a court in 
 the United States, or as otherwise required by law. 
 Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
 to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview.

 Thanks I am in the process of raising this internally on our end, but given recent events, and as I'm sure you can 
 imagine, it make take me a bit more time than usual to get back to you. I can tell you the conditions below are unlikely to 
 be acceptable to us as drafted, but provided it is in fact a rough outline, I am working on some proposed modifications 
 that folks here may be able to get comfortable with. I will circle back when I know more.

 I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient 
 way to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to 
 discuss anything. 
 Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
 connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
 others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
 copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
 our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
 contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request.

 Just confirming - did you use FedEx, USPS, or some other carrier to send the discovery here? I have not received it yet but it 
 could just be that staff did not notify me a package arrived. Depending on the carrier, it could be in the warehouse or 
 mailroom, so I just want to verify so I can find it expeditiously.

Before this weekend's events, I was planning on writing an email proposing that you put together 
 some very specific terms for an in-person interview that we can share with the Home Office and the 
 police force which makes the first formal approach to the witness's solicitors. Most of the terms are 
 already noted in the MLA request: who will be present, where it will take place (UK), whether it will 
 be recorded or written, etc. What isn't covered is any kind of a description or agreement about 
 confidentiality. Absent this, a MLA police interview will get hung up like your efforts at a voluntary 
 interview. 
 This weekend's events, which are troubling on many levels, also provide an opportunity in this case. 
 Blackfords's and the witness's anger have been focused on your former USA's public statements. 
 They may now have some greater confidence that they can rely on any statements of confidentiality. 
 Or at least they can now save face by agreeing to an interview. In any event, given the history of this, 
 I think absent a mutual agreement on confidentiality, this matter will get mired in litigation, and you 
 may never get the interview. 
 Here is a rough outline of what might be acceptable on confidentiality. This may give you heartburn, 
 but I think it is the most expeditious way forward: 
 Prior to the in-person interview: 
 An agreement that for a period lasting no longer than eight (8) weeks, neither the witness nor 
 any person representing him will make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the 
 plans for or terms of the interview. Likewise, the USDOJ agrees to make no public comment 
 about the matter during this period. If an interview has not been concluded within eight 
 weeks, this confidentiality agreement will not bar any further public or private comments on 
 the matter. 
 After an in-person interview: 
 If the witness makes a statement, both parties may confirm publicly or privately that: "the 
 witness has provided a formal statement to law enforcement authorities in the United States 
 about matters under investigation. Further comment would not be appropriate." Further 
 comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking for him will void this 
 agreement. 
 The content of witness's statement will be treated in the same manner as testimony taken 
 before a Federal Grand Jury under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). Among other things, unless used in 
 connection with a criminal proceeding, required to be disclosed in connection with a criminal 
 proceeding, or otherwise ordered disclosed by a court in the United States, the content of the 
 statement will not be made public. 
 Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
 to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview. 
 Putting something like this together will pave the way for getting the interview done.

 She arrived today at — 5:15 am and remained idle in the cell block

 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 My name is David Oscar Markus, and I am a lawyer in Miami who is representing Ghislaine Maxwell in 
 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals regarding bail. I will be present at the arraignment on April 23 and 
 look forward to meeting you and your staff in person. 
 My understanding is that out of town lawyers need a court order to take their electronics into the 
 courthouse. I am writing to ask for permission to bring my cell phone and laptop computer. If the Court is 
 agreeable, I am happy to provide a proposed order. 
 Thank you for your consideration and understanding.

 Do you have a few minutes today or tomorrow to discuss something? Specifically, a good friend of mine is the 
 executive producer on a 4-part Netflix series that will come out in a few months on Epstein (they had been working 
 on the story for 18 months before we charged). He had spoken ton one point (not sure how that 
 worked!) and wants to see if anyone from the office would give an interview, all backward looking. I imagine the 
 answer is no but they are going with this regardless, so thought I would at least make you and potentially chiefs 
 aware of it. Wanted to start with you. I'm free between now and noon or after 6pm tonight, or tomorrow morning 
 or after lunch. Thanks!

 We dropped off the Sweden travel memo for you — we were unexpectedly significantly delayed in getting OIA approval, 
 but it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final DOJ 
 approval this afternoon. Thank you! 
 And separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if 
 that's easier. 
 thanks again,

 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00031473
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abus 
 EFTA00031474
As alleged, minor victims were sub'ected to sexual abuse that included, amon other thins 
 MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL'S residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys

 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00031482
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00031483
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 As you know, we're in the process of reviewing the Bank's electronic communications related to its relationship with 
 Jeffrey Epstein. In the course of our ongoing review, we've located a chart which appears to identify Epstein's accounts at 
 J.P. Morgan prior to his transition to Deutsche Bank. The chart was attached to a September 12, 2013 email from Epstein's 
 accountant, Harry Beller, to Paul Morris's assistant, Amanda Kirby. The subject line of the email reads: "Let's discuss." 
 There is no text in the body of the email, but we know that Epstein was transferring assets from J.P. Morgan to Deutsche 
 Bank around this time. 
 Notably, the chart identifies several accounts that were previously unknown to us, including a brokerage account 
 belonging to the Butterfly Trust. The chart also identifies the managers of Epstein's J.P. Morgan brokerage and asset 
 trading accounts. While we had previously flagged Epstein's relationship to Paul Barrett, we were previously unaware of 
 Epstein's apparent relationship to Ted Serure or Laurie Cameron. As reflected in the chart, Ted Serure managed the 
 Butterfly Trust account, and, according to Barron's, he still works at J.P. Morgan Securities. 
 The referenced chart and email are attached. We will include a bates-stamped version of both documents in our next 
 production, which we are in the process of finalizing. That production will also include a significant number of emails 
 related to Darren Indyke's cash withdrawal activities. As always, we're happy to discuss if you have any questions or 
 would like us to follow up further.

 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact

 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00031492
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys

 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent

 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilitated, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney 
 Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
 ("FBP"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that 
 GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in 
 criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to 
 commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment unsealed 
 today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator Jeffrey 
 Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in 
 federal court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 EFTA00031498
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and participated 
 in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them 
 into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. All the while, 
 she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after 
 many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the most 
 important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law 
 and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest 
 for justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. 
 The example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and 
 connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the 
 bravery exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which 
 they've been subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will be 
 abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at I-
 800 -CALL FBI, and reference this case.

 According to the Indictment[ 11 unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at

 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL

 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal

 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of

 This is what I filed with Buchwald that led to the Order circulated a little while ago. It responded to, what I have 
 been calling, the defense-circulated boilerplate "airing of grievances" about BOP.

 I am guessing everyone is getting inundated with these. If possible, could people reply all with the word version 
 of what they've been submitting? I am assuming that the requests fall in the following categories: 
 I. Boilerplate request (i.e., pretrial detention and defendant has no risk factors) 
 2. Pretrial detention with certain risk factors (heart condition; asthma, etc.) 
 3. Post plea, pre-sentence 
 4. Post sentence 
 I am attaching one I did in a post sentence case. The defendant has to go through BOP process before applying 
 to the court for compassionate release. I am also attaching two from a gang case (one defendant had diabetes 
 and the other was more general). These were filed before the confirmed MCC case. With respect to the diabetic 
 defendant, Judge Daniels just denied the order without an opinion. 
 But, as we are handling many of these, it would be helpful to see what others are arguing. 
 Hope everyone is doing well!

 Attached is an order issued by Judge Engelmayer last week in a bail appeal. To the extent we end up consenting to bail or 
 a judge orders bail, this order is a helpful example. 
 Also attached is an order from Judge Buchwald denying bail where defense raises the boilerplate COVID-19 argument 
 we've been seeing in some cases. This could be helpful as we see more and more of these filed.

 One St. Andrew's Plaza 
 New York, NY 10007 
 EFTA00031507
Good afternoon, my name is Geoffrey Berman, I am the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
 of New York. Almost exactly one year ago today, I announced a two-count indictment of Jeffrey 
 Epstein by this Office for sexually abusing young girls. 
 A lot has changed since then. 
 Rather than face criminal prosecution, Epstein chose — as he so often did — to act selfishly, by 
 taking his own life just mere feet from here in the shadow of the very building where we 
 announced his indictment. Immediately after Epstein committed his final act of cowardice, I 
 announced that the search for those who enabled his hideous conduct would not end. And it 
 has not. 
 Epstein's suicide could not extinguish the voices or resolve of his victims, he only emboldened 
 them. Rather than let him have the final word, they chose to speak. Loudly. And with their help, 
 I am announcing the indictment of Ghislaine Maxwell, for [enumerate charges and detail her 
 conduct] for her alleged connection to the sex crimes of Jeffrey Epstein. 
 This case has been attention-getting and polarizing for so many reasons, the least of which is 
 that the victims of Epstein and Maxwell refuse to remain in the shadows, and their courage and 
 determination have been critical in bringing today's charges. These women have found their 
 voice and I hope serve as examples for other victims of abuse to come forward. Your voices are 
 being heard and you no longer need to remain in the shadows of abuse. These women deserve 
 respect, empathy, compassion, and most of all, justice. 
 As we stand in front of the historic federal courthouse, I'll conclude by saying that today's 
 charges remind us: no matter how wealthy, powerful, or well-connected you may be, justice is 
 blind in the eyes of the law, and if you abuse young women in this District, you will face justice.

 On the subject never ends, the State Department would like us to modify our proposed confidentiality language as 
 follows: 
 Absent a court order directing otherwise, U.S. authorities will not use or disclose the 
 content of the witness's statements in an interview with U.S. authorities in any matter 
 other than a U.S. criminal investigation or proceeding, and any non-criminal judicial 
 or administrative proceeding directly related to a U.S. criminal investigation or 
 proceeding, pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty. 
 Do you have thoughts on whether that would be broad enough to include any potential civil action we might pursue in 
 connection with the Epstein estate in USVI? Not sure we would ever plan to do so, but was trying to preserve the option. 
 That said, if this is the language of the treaty, not sure how hard we can push back.

 I think that's OK. Note that Touhy is not entirely discretionary—it applies after a subpoena issues, and our denial 
 can be reviewed in court. But we can easily insist on a court order. At the beginning of the 302 (and any notes) 
 the following should be stated: 
 Note that for purposes of any FOIA request, subpoena/Touhy request, Privacy Act routine use 
 disclosure, or any other disclosure this document is subject restrictions on disclosure pursuant to 
 the MLAT pursuant to which the interview took place. Absent a court order directing otherwise, 
 the SDNY or FBI will not use or disclose the content of the witness's statements in an interview 
 with law enforcement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or related 
 civil action or asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government. 
 The FBI should really understand that any leak of any of this would be pretty terrible.

 The UK could impose conditions on any evidence provided under the MLA treaty. Once the evidence 
 is provided they typically send a letter to us saying that the evidence is to be used only for the 
 purposes specified in the MLA request. Our MLA requests track the language of the Treaty, which 
 gives us use in criminal cases and related forfeiture and administrative actions. It doesn't deal with 
 FOIA or Touhy. (Since Touhy is discretionary, I assume we would just reject any requests for agent 
 testimony on this topic.)

 Thanks, John. I appreciate the concern and am open to working to address it, to the extent possible. We, of course, 
 would never simply turn this material over to a civil litigant, as you suggest. The problem is, irrespective of our intent, 
 this is not Rule 6 material (unless, of course, he testifies before a grand jury), and we are trying to be mindful of not 
 simply our criminal case, but obligations we may have under other aspects of U.S. law, FOIA and/or Touhy, spring to 
 mind, for example. Again, we never voluntarily turn this stuff over, and we frequently oppose FOIA requests and the like 
 to the extent we can under the law. But particularly given the history and concern, we don't want to make promises we 
 may not be able to keep. 
 Do you by any chance have handy a copy of the MLAT itself (if not, certainly happy to locate myself, just figured you 
 might have it already). I'd like to see what, if anything, the treaty says about this subject.

 Thanks. This is helpful. One clarification which they will seek - because it seems to loom

 of civil litigation. I know this is not something that ordinarily happens (I don't think I have 
 ever done this) - but I think we need to say something about that to move this forward. 
 Maybe something like, "Absent a court order directing otherwise, the SDNY will not use or

 Prior to the in-person interview: 
 - From now until August 14, 2020, neither the witness nor any person representing him will 
 make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the plans for or terms of the 
 interview. Likewise, the SDNY agrees to make no public comment about the matter during

 agreement will not bar any further public or private comments on the matter. 
 After an in-person interview: 
 - If the witness completes an interview with U.S. law enforcement, both parties may confirm 
 publicly or privately that: "the witness has met with law enforcement authorities in the 
 United States and answered questions about matters under investigation. We will not 
 comment further." Further comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking 
 for him will void this agreement. 
 - The content of the witness's statements to law enforcement as part of any interview arranged 
 pursuant to the MLA will only be used or disclosed as permitted under U.S. law, including in 
 connection with a criminal investigation or proceeding, as ordered or authorized by a court in 
 the United States, or as otherwise required by law.

 Before this weekend's events, I was planning on writing an email proposing that you put together 
 some very specific terms for an in-person interview that we can share with the Home Office and the 
 police force which makes the first formal approach to the witness's solicitors. Most of the terms are 
 already noted in the MLA request: who will be present, where it will take place (UK), whether it will 
 be recorded or written, etc. What isn't covered is any kind of a description or agreement about 
 confidentiality. Absent this, a MLA police interview will get hung up like your efforts at a voluntary 
 interview. 
 This weekend's events, which are troubling on many levels, also provide an opportunity in this case. 
 Blackfords's and the witness's anger have been focused on your former USA's public statements. 
 They may now have some greater confidence that they can rely on any statements of confidentiality. 
 Or at least they can now save face by agreeing to an interview. In any event, given the history of 
 this, I think absent a mutual agreement on confidentiality, this matter will get mired in litigation, and 
 you may never get the interview. 
 Here is a rough outline of what might be acceptable on confidentiality. This may give you 
 heartburn, but I think it is the most expeditious way forward: 
 Prior to the in-person interview: 
 - An agreement that for a period lasting no longer than eight (8) weeks, neither the witness nor 
 any person representing him will make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about 
 the plans for or terms of the interview. Likewise, the USDOJ agrees to make no public 
 comment about the matter during this period. If an interview has not been concluded within 
 eight weeks, this confidentiality agreement will not bar any further public or private 
 comments on the matter. 
 After an in-person interview: 
 - If the witness makes a statement, both parties may confirm publicly or privately that: "the 
 witness has provided a formal statement to law enforcement authorities in the United States 
 EFTA00031516
about matters under investigation. Further comment would not be appropriate." Further 
 comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking for him will void this 
 agreement. 
 The content of witness's statement will be treated in the same manner as testimony taken 
 before a Federal Grand Jury under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). Among other things, unless used in 
 connection with a criminal proceeding, required to be disclosed in connection with a criminal 
 proceeding, or otherwise ordered disclosed by a court in the United States, the content of the 
 statement will not be made public. 
 Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
 to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview. 
 Putting something like this together will pave the way for getting the interview done.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 EFTA00031520
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 EFTA00031521
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

 SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
 Southern District of New York 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00031532
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00031533
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

 Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a month 
 later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
 getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
 materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
 devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point we 
 should have a vendor do it. 
 Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
 format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
 efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
 month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

 You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

 I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
 discussions with . Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
 particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
 drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
 everything is complete.

Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that 
 was collected (including reproducing the materials that you previously gave us, but which are not searchable), or have you 
 and I= figured out a way to categorize the prior productions so they're useful for us? We would strongly prefer to just 
 get everything at once in a usable format, but please let us know if you expect to produce materials differently than that.

 Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
 September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you

 Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
 can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
 levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
 the following loose storage devices: 
 o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
 o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
 o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
 o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
 o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
 The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
 The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 EFTA00031540
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
 match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

 Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
 unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
 convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
 size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
 file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
 in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
 iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
 get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

 Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 EFTA00031541
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
 back was lacking.

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

 Sony for the delay, they reduced us to 1 day a week, so things have been stretched out by a factor of 5. I will be

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
 clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
 they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
 Spreadsheet is attached.

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
 search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
 transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
 mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
 and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
 was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
 able to review them as well.)

 Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
 on the rest.

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
 modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info — 
 EFTA00031550
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us.

 CONTACT: U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
 FBI 
 JEFFREY EPSTEIN CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT 
 WITH SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS 
 Alleged Conduct Occurred in both New York and Florida over Multiple Years, 
 Involving Dozens of Victims 
 Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
 ., the Assistant Director in Char e of the New York Field Office of the 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and Commissioner of the New York 
 City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that JEFFREY EPSTEIN was arrested Saturday 
 and charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. 
 The indictment unsealed today alleges that, between 2002 through 2005, EPSTEIN sexually 
 exploited and abused dozens of underage girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts with him in 
 exchange for money. Epstein allegedly worked with several employees and associates to ensure 
 that he had a steady supply of minor victims to abuse, and paid several of those victims 
 themselves to recruit other underage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. He committed 
 these offenses in locations including New York, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. EPSTEIN 
 is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate 
 Judge Henry B. Pitman. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman. 
 U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, Jeffrey Epstein abused underage 
 girls for years, operating a scheme in which girls he victimized would recruit others for Epstein 
 to exploit and abuse. Epstein exploited girls who were vulnerable to abuse, enticed them with 
 cash payments, and escalated his conduct to include sex acts, often occurring at his residence on 
 the Upper East Side of Manhattan. While the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, 
 the victims — then children and now young women — are no less entitled to their day in court. 
 My Office is proud to stand up for these victims by bringing this indictment."

 Thanks, Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you know 
 (that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC

 Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 All: 
 I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
 trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
 Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
 counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
 general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
 population). 
 EFTA00031576
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
 MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
 scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel 
 appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
 Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
 Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
 review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
 concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires 
 the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
 which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
 any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
 At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
 has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
 defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
 night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
 accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
 far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
 treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
 disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us toe lain 
 the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with and before 
 our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
 Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
 amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
 Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
 explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
 Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
 access are as follows: 
 Accommodation Maxwell Rivera 
 Review of electronic 
 discovery (NB: each 
 defendant has laptop access) 
 13 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (91 hours total) 
 3 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (21 hours total) 
 Counsel visits (by video) 3 hours per day/5 days per 
 week (15 hours total) 
 Four hours per week (plus an 
 additional two hours 
 scheduled through the 
 Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
 total) 
 Weekend legal calls As needed Not available 
 The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
 criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
 you were all aware of this issue. We are also ha to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
 meantime, we are working with to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
 explanation for the Court. 
 Best, 
 EFTA00031577
FBI Assistant Director . said: "We are asking anyone who may 
 have been victimized by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone who may have information about his alleged 
 criminal behavior, to please call us. The number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. We want to hear from 
 you, regardless of the age you are now, or whatever age you were then, no matter where the 
 incident took place. The bravery it takes to call us might empower others to speak out about the 
 crimes committed against them. It is important to remember there was never, nor will there ever 
 be an excuse for this type of behavior. In the eyes of the FBI, the victims will always come 
 first." 
 NYPD Commissioner said: "Today's charges serve as a warning to 
 individuals who continue to prey upon some of our society's most vulnerable population: we are 
 coming for you. I thank and commend the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District and 
 the FBI for their tireless efforts to ensure child predators are taken off our streets. The NYPD 
 will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to eradicate the trafficking of children 
 in our city and nation and work to bring justice to victims of these heinous crimes." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, 
 please contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment' unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 2002 through at least 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN enticed and recruited, and 
 caused to be enticed and recruited, dozens of minor girls to visit his mansion in New York, New 
 York (the "New York Residence"), and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Palm Beach 
 Residence"), to engage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of 
 dollars in cash. In order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid 
 certain victims to recruit additional underage girls whom he could similarly abuse. In this way, 
 EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a 
 daily basis, in locations including New York and Palm Beach. 
 EPSTEIN's victims were as young as 14 at the time he abused them, and were, for 
 various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Moreover, EPSTEIN knew that 
 many of his victims were under 18, including because, in some instances, victims expressly told 
 him they were underage. 
 In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to abuse and 
 exploit sexually, EPSTEIN worked with others, including employees and associates who 
 facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual 
 encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
 In both New York and Florida, EPSTEIN perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
 Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which became increasingly 
 sexual in nature and would typically include one or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims 
 hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
 As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment 
 set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation.

 United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell. 20 Cr. 330 (AIN): In July 2020, Maxwell was charged in a six-count indictment with 
 facilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The charges 
 resulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators, 
 including Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to 
 engage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein's abusive behavior, and she even 
 took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
 Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and 
 subjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in 
 illegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. Then, in an effort to cover 
 up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with 
 minor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, 
 and the Court has denied two separate bail motions, most recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July 
 2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021. The most recent press release is located here:

In particular, during encounters at the New York Residence, victims would be taken to a 
 room where they would perform a massage on EPSTEIN, during which EPSTEIN would 
 frequently escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among 
 other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. 
 In connection with the encounters, EPSTEIN, or one of his employees or associates, typically 
 paid each victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Once minor victims were recruited, EPSTEIN or 
 his employees or associates would contact victims to schedule appointments for "massages." As 
 a result, many victims were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent occasions. 
 To further enable him to abuse underage girls, EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his 
 victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts 
 with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another underage girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
 the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
 recruiters, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit, and gained access to 
 dozens of additional underage girls to abuse. 
 JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 66, is charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors, which 
 carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex 
 trafficking of minors, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are 
 provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be 
 determined by the judge. 
 Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. He 
 also thanked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for their assistance. 
 This case is bein: handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. 
 Attorneys are in char e of the rosecution, 
 with assistance from the Office's Human Trafficking Co-Coordinator, 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is 
 presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

 All, 
 Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
 discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
 In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
 Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
 • There are three categories of these images: 
 o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
 been previously provided to you) 
 o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
 previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
 o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
 Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
 • The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
 and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
 o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
 be viewed using Cellebrite. 
 o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
 devices. 
 o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
 image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
 other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
 o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
 to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
 EFTA00031589
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
 there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
 to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
 Regarding the physical evidence: 
 • Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
 associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
 FBI New York office's current investigation. 
 • The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
 items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
 Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
 you will have all evidence in one place. 
 • The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
 following conditions: 
 o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
 place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
 o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
 o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
 o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
 To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
 to be physically present for this review. 
 o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
 may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
 the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
 are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
 presence of nudity. 
 o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
 • To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
 the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
 items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
 Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
 necessary. 
 • The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
 single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
 that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
 anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
 downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
 o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
 residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
 your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
 all of those discs. 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

 Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
 when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
 At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
 Thanks, 
 Laura

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
 Thank you,

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 EFTA00031592
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

 Counsel, 
 In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

 DOCUMENT 
 ELECTRONICALLY FILED

 DATE FILED: 
 3/18/21 
 20-CR-330 (MN) 
 ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing 
 Defendants' twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, 
 under temporary seal pending the Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or 
 confidential information. See Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to 
 certain of the redactions that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional 
 redactions. Having considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the 
 Government's requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional 
 redaction requests, with the exceptions discussed below. 
 To begin with, the Court's reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the 
 Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under 
 this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial 
 documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; 
 and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 119-20. 
 "Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to `the danger of impairing law 
 enforcement or judicial efficiency' and `the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.' Id. at 
 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo IT)). 
 I 
 EFTA00031598
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 2 of 5 
 The proposed redactions mostly satisfy this test. First, the Government's brief in 
 opposition to the Defendant's pre-trial motions is a "judicial document" for purposes of the first 
 element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 
 1995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment 
 presumption of access. Id. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner Conzmc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 
 (1978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrowly tailored to 
 serve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access. 
 Like the Government's previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the 
 Government bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to 
 protect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties' personal 
 privacy interests. As a general matter, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for 
 overcoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 
 460, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 420, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2009). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the 
 Government's brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit 1 contains a single redaction—the 
 name of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual's personal privacy interests 
 outweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The 
 proposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only 
 the names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety 
 and privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that attaches to those 
 documents. 
 The Court overrules the Defendant's objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5 
 of the Government's brief and adopts the Government's proposed redactions. The core of the 
 2 
 EFTA00031599
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 3 of 5 
 Defendant's objections relate to her contention that some of the information contained in the 
 redactions has been made public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions to which 
 the Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has 
 admonished "should weigh heavily in a court's balancing equation." United States v. Amodeo 
 ("Amodeo II"), 71 F.3d 1044,1050 (2d Cir. 1995). At least some of the redactions to which the 
 Defendant objects relate to private "family affairs" of a third party, a factor that "weigh[s] more 
 heavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public." Id. at 1051. 
 And though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions is 
 public, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the 
 significant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrowly tailored redactions 
 contained in Exhibit 5. 
 In addition, the Court adopts the Defendant's proposed additional redactions to pages 
 129-134 of the Government's brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the 
 civil matter, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a 
 "craving for that which is sensational and impure." Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051 (citation 
 omitted). The Court thus concludes that such redactions are justified. 
 On the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant's objections to the redactions 
 contained in pages 1-128 of the Government's brief. To provide some context, the redacted 
 portions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating 
 to the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the present case. See Dkt. No. 51. 
 Because the Government's brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access 
 attaches, the Government's redaction requests must be "necessary to preserve higher values and 
 only if the sealing order is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim." Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of 
 3 
 EFTA00031600
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 4 of 5 
 Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir. 2006). Courts have noted that "disclosing the details of 
 the Government's efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the 
 individuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice." United States v. Madoff, 
 626 F. Supp. 2d 420, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). And the Government's interest in protecting an 
 ongoing investigation from the "danger of impairing law enforcement" may be a countervailing 
 factor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120. But the 
 Government advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the 
 matter would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding how it obtained the 
 information in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrowly tailored. As a result, 
 the Court denies the Government's redaction requests in pages 1-128 and denies its request to 
 file Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same 
 reasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more 
 tailored redactions if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested 
 information and documents. By March 22, 2021, the Government may file a letter with the 
 Court —under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific redaction and sealing requests. 
 Alternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request. 
 Furthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant's objections to the redactions 
 contained in pages 187-188 of the Government's brief. While the Court previously had granted 
 the request to redact the same information, see Dkt. No. 99, the Court no longer sees a basis for 
 keeping this information under seal in light of the strong presumption of access. The information 
 does not in itself contain any personally identifying information, and the Court concludes that 
 any minimal threat of interference with the Government's investigation through the disclosure of 
 this information is outweighed by the presumption of access that attaches to those portions. As 
 4 
 EFTA00031601
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 5 of 5 
 above, however, the Court will give the Government an opportunity to justify the ongoing need 
 to redact this information and these documents; by March 22, 2021, the Government may file a 
 letter with the Court—under seal, if necessary—justifying the redaction and sealing requests. 
 Finally, the Court denies the Government's request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. 
 While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. 
 See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees 
 no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant portions. 
 In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their 
 brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file a letter with the Court 
 justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding pages 1-128 and 187-188 and 
 Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The parties are further ORDERED to meet, 
 confer, and jointly propose redactions to the Defendant's cover letter objecting to the 
 Government's proposed redactions by March 22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to 
 meet, confer, and propose redactions to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 
 22, 2021. 
 SO ORDERED.

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Mr. Manley: 
 The Government writes in response to your letter to the Honorable Alison J. Nathan regarding 
 your client and your request for assurances regarding ensuring your client's anonymity 
 in upcoming criminal proceedings, including in documents or information that identifies your client. 
 As an initial matter, the Government notes that to date, there have been no filings on the public 
 docket in the above-captioned criminal case that name your client. Second, to the extent the 
 Government has produced documents with your client's name to the defense pursuant to its disclosure 
 obligations in this criminal case, those materials have been designated as confidential and are 
 governed by the Protective Order in this case (Dkt. No. 36). Pursuant to the Protective Order, the 
 defense is prohibited from filing publicly any confidential information referenced in the discovery 
 materials, unless authorized by the Government in writing or by order of the Court. The defense has 
 complied with this requirement of the Protective Order and has indicated that it will continue to do 
 SO. 
 As to the upcoming criminal trial in this matter, the Government notes that it does not intend 
 to call your client as a witness at trial. As a courtesy,' we note that your client's name may arise 
 As a general matter, the Government is not obligated to provide a detailed preview to the defense, 
 or third parties, about how it expects to prove its case at trial. 
 EFTA00031609

 during the public testimony of witnesses and may be listed on public exhibits introduced at trial. See 
 United States v. Akhavan, 20 Cr. 188 (JSR), 2021 WL 1216909, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. I, 2021) ("[T]he 
 public has a similar right to access documents presented to the jury, and in criminal cases, this right 
 stems from not only the common law, but also the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a 'public trial.' 
 Indeed, the Second Circuit has explained that 'the public has an especially strong right of access to 
 evidence introduced in trials."' (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) 
 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). 
 Finally, although the Government is mindful of privacy interests of third parties,' we are not 
 aware of any procedure under United States criminal law that allows third parties to exercise input 
 regarding whether or not their names or information about them will be mentioned at a criminal trial, 
 nor would it be legally permissible to conduct a trial under seal or preclude public access to a criminal 
 trial. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 AUDREY STRAUSS 
 United States Attorney 
 By:  s/
 Assistant United States Attorneys 
 Cc: The Honorable Alison J. Nathan (By email) 
 Defense counsel (By email) 
 The Government is not presently aware of any authority under which the privacy laws of the United 
 Kingdom would have any force in this jurisdiction, and your letter cites none. In addition, the 
 Government respectfully notes that your client is not a victim of child sexual exploitation in 
 connection with this case, and thus the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, does not apply.

 As you are undoubtedly aware, there has been some press coverage since yesterday about the release pursuant to FOIA of

 actual source materials (USM lls (equivalent of 302s)) that were inadvertently released, because they were not in all 
 circumstances accurately reported, and he wanted to make sure that if we are concerned about any harm to our

 I work at MCC NY. I was working the rear gate area when the gate pass inmate named brought 
 back to the gate bays of shredded papers to throw out into the dumpster on Thursday and one bag on Friday. He stated 
 that members of the BOP after action team that were investigating what happened with the Epstein suicide were 
 shredding boxes of paperwork. He stated, "they are shredding everything". He stated that he even was told to help them 
 shred paperwork too. I believe that this conduct maybe inappropriate for a investigative team to be shredding 
 paperwork related to the investigation and you may want to investigate why BOP employees were destroying records.

Ghislaine Maxwell moves to suppress all evidence the government obtained from a grand 
 jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which 
 are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
 Counts Five and Six allege that Maxwell committed perjury during two civil depositions 
 conducted by Boies Schiller in a defamation action it filed against Maxwell on behalf of one of 
 the firm's clients. v. Marvell, Case No. 15-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A Protective 
 Order entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential 
 discovery material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the 
 government and law enforcement. Faced with that Protective Order, the government issued a 
 grand jury subpoena for Boies Schiller's file and instituted an ex parte proceeding before Chief 
 Judge McMahon to modify the Protective Order. By proceeding ex parte, the government 
 ensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations 
 in support of its application. 
 The government then took full advantage. Judge McMahon, citing this Court's decision 
 in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), asked the 
 government, point blank, whether Southern District prosecutors had previously met with the 
 Boies Schiller firm or otherwise "collu[ded]" with that firm in arranging the discovery request. 
 The government lawyer assured Judge McMahon that the prosecutors had no idea what was in 
 Boies Schiller's file. Indeed, he insisted, there had been no contact whatsoever between Boies 
 Schiller and United States Attorney's Office before the government commenced its investigation. 
 Nor, said the prosecutor, did Boies Schiller have any role instigating the Maxwell inquiry.

To paraphrase Mary McCarthy's philippic about Lillian Hellman, every word of the 
 government's representation was untrue, "including 'and' and `the."' The government knew 
 what was in the Boies Schiller file; the law firm had provided that information well before the 
 investigation began. The government did indeed have previous contact with (the trml. And Boiei 
 Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution. 
 The record is surpassingly clear: But for the 
 not, Judge McMahon 
 government's misrepresentation, witting or 
 never would have permitted the circumvention of the civil Protective 
 Order, on which Maxwell relied in agreeing to sit for her depositions. This Court therefore has 
 both the authority and the duty to suppress the fruits of that misrepresentation, including the 
 deposition transcripts and the two perjury counts based on those transcripts. If the Court is 
 disinclined to exercise that inherent authority on the present record, Maxwell should be granted a 
 hearing to examine the circumstances that resulted in the 
 Judge McMahon 
 government's misrepresentations to 
 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 A. The Protective Order in v. Maxwell 
 Counts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell committed 
 perjury during two civil depositions taken in v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case 
 filed in 2015. claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell's attorney-hired 
 press agent denied as "untrue" and "obvious lies" numerous allegations, over the span 
 of four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause to be "sexually abused 
 and trafficked" by Jeffrey Epstein.

, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill battle—even she 
 was constrained to acknowledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-
 honored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the 
 lawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was bitter, 
 hard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document 
 productions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including 
 depositions of and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 
 F.3d 41, 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining that discovery was "hard-fought" and "extensive" and 
 noting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery, 
 totals in the "thousands of pages"). 
 sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about 
 Maxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual matters. Brown, 929 F.3d 
 at 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between 
 the parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective 
 Order included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party's confidentiality 
 designation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any 
 information or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case settled before trial, that sole 
 exception to the Protective Order was never triggered.) 
 Notably, Boies Schiller sought to add a "law enforcement" exception to the Protective 
 Order, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against 
 Maxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that 
 "CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the 
 preparation and trial of this case and any related matter, including but not limited to, 
 investigations by law enforcement." Ex. Bil(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected

this proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order. Ex. A.2 To the contrary, the 
 order strictly limited the parties' disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion 
 of the case. In particular, paragraph 12 of the order provided that: 
 [a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
 document and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL 
 shall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties 
 may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to 
 destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties 
 with an affidavit confirming destruction. 
 Ex. Al 12. 
 B. Maxwell's April and July 2016 depositions 
 Relying on the confidentiality protections of the Protective Order, Maxwell declined to 
 invoke her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and agreed to testify at her April 
 2016 deposition. In that deposition, attorneys asked Maxwell whether "Jeffrey Epstein 
 [had] a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you know." Maxwell replied, "I 
 don't know what you're talking about." And when asked to "[I]ist all the people under the age of 
 18 that you interacted with at any of Jeffrey's properties," Maxwell responded, "I'm not aware of 
 anybody that I interacted with, other than obviously [MI who was 17 at this point." Count 
 Five of the superseding indictment alleges those two answers were false. 
 Following the deposition, moved to compel Maxwell to answer additional 
 intimate and personal questions that she had previously declined to answer. In support of the 
 motion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that "[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in 
 the discovery phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as 
 confidential under the Protective Order in this case." 
 'This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this 
 information by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential 
 material to the media, other false claimants, and the government.

 providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. 
 Maxwell's lawyers categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against 
 MDC staff based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates 
 no views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either 
 side's allegations. This Court's obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the 
 defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential attorney-
 client communications, and prepare for trial. 
 Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After 
 receiving the defense's first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause 
 why the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in 
 part defense counsel's original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain 
 questions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to ensure the 
 confidentiality of Ms. Maxwell's lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense 
 EFTA00031685
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 265 Filed 05/03/21 Page 2 of 3 
 counsel's current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of 
 the in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of 
 defense counsel's preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel 
 are entitled to view or receive copies of those materials as a matter of law, they should be 
 provided. To the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this 
 Court, that application is denied. 
 The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the opportunity 
 to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all relevant circumstances 
 and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates in BOP custody. The isolated 
 incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the serious allegations leveled by MDC legal 
 counsel and defense counsel in no way undermine the Court's conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and 
 her lawyers are fully able to prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize 
 the importance of this going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. 
 In furtherance of this, counsel for the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal 
 counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-
 client communications as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel 
 shall promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to 
 resolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties 
 may write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific 
 application being made. 
 SO ORDERED.

 ALISON J. NATHAN 
 United States District Judge 
 EFTA00031687
The district court granted the motion. In requiring Maxwell to answer highly intrusive 
 questions "relating to [her] own sexual activity" and "her knowledge of the sexual activity of 
 others," the court held that Maxwell's "privacy concerns are alleviated by the protective order in 
 this case." 
 Secure in the belief that the Protective Order would be honored, Maxwell appeared at a 
 second deposition. in July 2016. and answered hundreds of pages worth of questions about her 
 "own sexual activity" and "her knowledge of the sexual activities of others." From the very first 
 question, Maxwell discussed the intimate details of her sexual activity with Epstein, with other 
 adult men, with other adult women, the use of sex toys, participation in "threesomes," and a full 
 gamut of other sordid sexual topics. She was asked where she had sex, when she had sex, with 
 whom she had sex, what types of sexual predilections Epstein had, whether others watched her 
 having sex, whether she watched other people having sex, and whether she slept with clothes on. 
 She was asked whether Epstein had sex with any number of women, and the names of women he 
 might have had sex with. Maxwell was also grilled extensively about massages: when, where, 
 what she was wearing, who gave them. 
 Count Six of the superseding indictment alleges that Maxwell provided false testimony 
 when she testified during her July 2016 deposition that: (1) she could not recall whether sex toys 
 or devices were used in sexual activities at Epstein's Palm Beach house; (2) she did not know 
 whether Epstein possessed sex toys or devices used in sexual activities; (3) she wasn't aware that 
 Epstein was having sexual activities with anyone other than herself when she was with him; and 
 (4) she never gave anyone, including Accuser-23, a massage. 
 The indictment refers to the accusers as Minor Victim-I, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. 
 We will refer to them as Accuser-1, Accuser-2, and Accuser-3.

Docket Text: 
 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice justify 
 granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 to be 
 reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to 
 prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also 
 ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary or in 
 the interests of justice. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 
 2021, they shall jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office 
 (as is required by COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest 
 possible date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an 
 early fall trial start date. The parties shall also discuss and propose any adjustments 
 necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government may move in the 
 letter for any requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act. (Signed by Judge 
 J. Nathan on 5/3/2021) (See ORDER set forth) (ap)

 All, 
 EFTA00031694
I am looking forward to tomorrow's White Collar Crime Committee meeting. Hard to believe it will be our last meeting 
 before the summer. 
 Upcoming Events 
 We'll begin the meeting by discussing two exciting events scheduled for the fall: (1) the International Symposium, which 
 will take place on November 29-30, 2021, and (2) the panel event featuring authors of prominent books on white collar 
 crime, which is calendared for September 13, 2021. Although these events aren't for a few months, given the summer 
 break, we'll spend a few minutes discussing tomorrow. 
 Speaker 
 During the second half of the meeting, we will be joined by Ken Blanco. Ken served for many years as a Deputy Assistant 
 Attorney General in the Criminal Division, after service as an AUSA in the Southern District of Florida. After a stint as 
 Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, Ken joined the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes 
 Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as its Director. Ken recently left the government to join Citi as Chief Compliance Officer of 
 its newly created financial crimes unit. 
 Rule 17 Project 
 The bulk of the meeting will involve a continuation of our discussion of the Rule 17 advocacy project. Since our last 
 meeting, the working group and I have engaged in productive dialogue with the federal defenders and the federal 
 prosecutors on our committee. Based on those conversations, we propose striking the "other than the victim" language 
 we had proposed adding to Rule 17(c), which, in our initial proposal read "After a complaint, indictment, or information is 
 filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about an individual (non-corporate) 
 victim may be served on a third party, other than the victim,_only by court order." Striking the "other than the victim" 
 language is intended to address concerns from both the Government (about victim safety) and from the Federal 
 Defenders' liaison to the Rules Committee. In addition, we have also tweaked the cover letter to the Rules Committee to 
 address these concerns, to emphasize that our proposal is intended to reduce ambiguity in the Rule as currently drafted, 
 and to emphasize the fact that, without meaningful subpoena power, many criminal defendants are effectively limited to 
 building their defense around information gathered and provided by the Government and are severely constrained in 
 building their own affirmative defenses to meet the Government's allegations. 
 Both groups provided feedback (all in their individual capacities and not on behalf of their organizations), which we 
 summarize below and hope to discuss tomorrow: 
 • The proposed revisions actually increase the authority of prosecutors by allowing them to more easily use trial 
 subpoenas to obtain documents from third parties in advance of trial. 
 • Permitting subpoenas without judicial "gate-keeping" could spark backlash to the proposal. 
 • The Committee should consider revisions to Rule 17(b), which requires court approval of subpoenas for "named 
 witnesses" where the defendant can't pay witness fees — a requirement that is logistically challenging and only 
 applicable to indigent defendants. 
 • The letter overstates equity arguments in describing the Government's access to more powerful investigative tools 
 because: (i) the Government must satisfy a very high burden and (ii) the Government is constrained by Federal Rule 
 of Criminal Procedure 6, the Privacy Act, and Department of Justice Policy with respect to the information it may 
 subpoena and how that information may be used. 
 • The letter overstates the flaws of the Nixon standard, since the Government's robust discovery obligations 
 adequately enable a defendant to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a case against him. 
 • Significantly expanding a defendant's Rule 17 subpoena capabilities may negatively influence the willingness of 
 victims and witnesses to cooperate, and motions to quash provide an insufficient remedy to address this issue. 
 • The letter offers an inadequate rationale for limiting court approval to subpoenas regarding victims. 
 We hope to reach consensus on if/how to address the feedback above as well as on any remaining open issues. Ideally, 
 the working group—with the Committee's approval—will then finalize and submit the proposal over the coming weeks. I 
 have once again attached the latest version of the revised rule proposal (in clean and redlined versions), as well as the 
 draft letter to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules that the working group has put together.

C. The Settlement And Boies Schiller's Refusal To Comply With The 
 Protective Order 
 In 2017, the parties settled the defamation claim, and the case was dismissed. v. 
 Maxwell, 325 F. Supp. 3d 428, 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), vacated and remanded sub nom. Brown, 
 929 F.3d 41. As the district court found, "a significant, if not determinative, factor" in reaching a 
 settlement was its confidentiality. Id. at 446. 
 After the case was settled and concluded, Maxwell repeatedly invoked Paragraph 12 of 
 the Protective Order and demanded that either return or destroy all confidential 
 information, including her deposition transcripts. Boies Schiller refused.

 D. The Government's False Statements To

 Judge McMahon 
 Only in August 2020, after she was indicted in this case, did Maxwell finally learn that 
 the government had obtained the Boies Schiller file by grand jury subpoena. Maxwell also 
 learned that, to overcome the strictures of the Protective Order, the government had instituted an 
 ex pane proceeding before Judge McMahon, Case No. 19-Misc.-149 (CM) (S.D.N.Y). 
 Needless to say, neither Maxwell nor her attorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that 
 application or to contest the government's representations in support of the application. This was 
 all in direct violation of Paragraph 14 of the Protective Order, which provides that the order may 
 be modified by the court only "for good cause shown following notice to all parties and an 
 opportunity to be heard." Ex. A I 14 (emphasis added). 
 In its ex pane application, the prosecutors professed that they had sought out Boies

Litigation, including the complaint and other docketed filings ... appear[ed] to make reference 
 to certain subjects relating to the Investigation." That "publicly available information," the 
 government claimed, indicated that the Boies Schiller file might "contain information relevant to 
 the ongoing Investigation" of Jeffrey Epstein. Ex. C, 4. Nowhere did the government 
 acknowledge that Boies Schiller had in fact approached the prosecutors multiple times well 
 before the grand jury subpoena issued. 
 In March 2019, in the first appearance before Judge McMahon, the Government 
 continued this refrain, professing ignorance about what was in Boies Schiller's file or who was 
 deposed in the case. The prosecutor defended the subpoena's breadth—which sought all "copies 
 of discovery and related materials" in v. Maxwell-on the ground that the government 
 simply had too little knowledge of what was in the law firm's files to craft a more narrowly 
 tailored subpoena: 
 Here, we are essentially unable to significantly narrow the request for information 
 in part for exactly the reasons that you describe. We have either little or no 
 additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are, who 
 was deposed, and that is in marked contrast to some of the other cases. 
 Ex. D, p 17. For all the government knew, according to the Assistant U.S. Attorney, what he was 
 seeking was "page after page of people taking the Fifth." Ex. D. p 19. 
 The government appeared a second time before Judge McMahon in April 2019. Ex. E. 
 Judge McMahon held that conference for one reason: to learn "about contacts between the 
 United States Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller law firm prior to the issuance of the 
 subpoena." Ex. E, p 2. The Assistant U.S. Attorney told Judge McMahon that the government's 
 investigation began on either November 30 or December 3, 2018, omitting mention of any 
 contacts between Boies Schiller and the government prior to that time: 
 In the initial days and weeks of the investigation, we endeavored to identify 
 information about the subject of the investigation, including, among other things,

 The following transaction was entered on 12/28/2020 at 3:04 PM EST and filed on 12/28/2020 
 Case Name: USA v. Maxwell 
 Case Number: 1:20-cr-00330-AJN

 Document Number: 104 
 Docket Text: 
 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed 
 motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, 
 the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially 
 confidential information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 
 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by 
 reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 
 2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court 
 will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the 
 Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial 
 detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to 
 submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose an redactions and the justification for any such 
 proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97. (Signed by Judge J. Nathan on 12/28/20)(jw)

 Heil- yeah, I was in Florida on Wednesday and Thursday, thanks for checking in on this. It hasn't been resolved (and 
 I didn't hear back fro all week), so I'm going to send an email suggesting we all get together to talk it through. Just 
 yesterday we got access to t e latest document dump, and it's over a million files, and we have no idea where they came 
 from, so we definitely want to nail it down. We're all in L.A. most of this week, but the week after should be around 
 (which will also provide time for people to figure out schedules). 
 thanks as always,

 cee below — just wanted to loop you into this too, since we've previously talked about the search warrant returns. 
 We are now finally starting to get a significant amount into the system, but the problem is we have no idea what it is, 
 where it's from, etc. We're just getting huge amounts of documents, but don't know what device they came from, room, 
 any identifying info, etc etc. So working on getting that. 
 Currently, both have access on Relativity to a little over 20,000 documents from the Manhattan 
 residence, and I expect that will go up substantially in the next week or so once we get this next set of materials reviewed 
 for privilege. 
 Happy to chat if that'd be useful, and thanks as always.

 Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
 I'm not sure w ' exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive tha dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 EFTA00031712
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, an nd I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, an w at as been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
 modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have,. are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every evice, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 Subject: Jeffrey Epstein Victim; Ms 17 years old 
 I am a very close friend of Ms. and her guardian, Ms. 
 of Calderitas, Mexico. Ms. was abused by 
 Jeffrey Epstein on numerous occasions at his townhome in New 
 York and his caribbean island home in the Virgin Islands. They 
 both have expressed their interest in asking me to register her claim 
 as a victim in any case involving Mr. Epstein's estate, which she 
 believes she may have a claim. 
 She does not have legal representation yet, but is in negotiations to 
 retain and attorney soon. 
 Regards, 
 EFTA00029639
possible victims who we should speak to. In the process of doing so, we identified 
 certain counsel that were identified as representing victims or witnesses either in 
 public filings or in media reports. Boies Schiller was among those plaintiff 
 attorneys. So following the opening of the investigation, we were in touch with 
 Boies Schiller, among other plaintiff and witness counsel, in connection with their 
 representation of witnesses or victims. 
 With respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during 
 the investigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil 
 litigation and so asked them, as is our standard practice, told them, I should say, 
 that we expected to make document requests. They generally advised us that they 
 believed there was a protective order that would govern at least some of the 
 materials, and that is why we ultimately made the application to the Court. 
 Ex. E, 99 pp 2-3. 
 Those representations were false. At the time the government claims it began the 
 investigation (late November or early December 2018), its knowledge of the civil case was not 
 based exclusively on public filings. It knew that Boies Schiller possessed relevant information 
 because the firm had come to the government asking it to open an investigation. In particular, on 
 February 29, 2016, AUSA Amanda Kramer met with attorneys from Boies Schiller, who "urged 
 Kramer to open an investigation of" Epstein and Maxwell!' Then, after Maxwell's two 
 depositions, David Boies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2016, 
 asking "if the Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury." Brown, supra 
 n.2. Said Mr. Boies: 
 "We were saying to anyone who would listen: We've got clients who were abused. 
 Some of them were underage. We have the evidence. There's a whole record that's 
 been developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive 
 sex trafficking ring going on."

At that time, however, the government did not act. Boles "was particularly frustrated by 
 the failure to pursue a perjury charge [against Maxwell]," reported one person, who recalled him 
 saying, "We have her dead to rights."5 M. All of this contradicts The government's 
 representations to Judge McMahon, who specifically asked if the government had any contact 
 with Boies Schiller before it issued the subpoena. 
 Reassured by the government that no contact had occurred, Judge McMahon modified 
 the Protective Order so that Boies Schiller could comply with the subpoena. Ex. F. Judge 
 McMahon found that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the Protective Order as 
 prohibiting Boies Schiller from cooperating with the government. In making this finding, Judge 
 McMahon relied on the Assistant U.S. Attorney's misrepresentations, and she distinguished the 
 government's subpoena to Boies Schiller from the subpoena at issue in Chemical Bank. Said 
 Judge McMahon: 
 [T]he icting on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is 
 that or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank 
 did —that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the 
 purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that situation. 
 Nothing in this record suggests to me that or Boies Schiller had anything to 
 do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
 that were the subject of the Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
 advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
 who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
 Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
 files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
 "collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
 did not foment the Government's investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United 
 States Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies 
 Schiller's files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood on 
 his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. 
 Ex.G,p21. 
 5 Ms. Maxwell strenuously disagrees with Mr. Boles' comments. We reference them here only to 
 show their connection to the perjury counts that the government subsequently charged.

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 In the case of Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, 
 The European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a 
 Chamber composed of: 
 Lech Garlicki, President, 
 David Th6r Bjorgvinsson, 
 Nicolas Bratza, 
 Paivi Hirvelg, 
 George Nicolaou, 
 Ledi Bianku, 
 Nebojga Vuoinie, judges, 
 and Lawrence Early, Section Registrar, 
 Having deliberated in private on 20 March 2012, 
 Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: 
 PROCEDURE 
 1. The case originated in five applications (nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 
 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09) against the United Kingdom of Great 
 Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the 
 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
 ("the Convention"). 
 2. The first application was lodged on 10 June 2007 by two British 
 nationals, Mr Babar Ahmad ("the first applicant") and Mr Haroon Rashid 
 Aswat ("the second applicant"). They were both born in 1974. 
 The second application was lodged on 5 March 2008 by Mr Syed Tahla 
 Ahsan ("the third applicant"), who is also a British national. He was born in 
 1979. 
 The third application was lodged on I August 2008 by Mr Mustafa 
 Kamal Mustafa, known more commonly as Abu Hamza ("the fourth 
 applicant"). He is a British national, who was born in 1958. 
 The fourth application was lodged on 21 December 2009 by Mr Adel 
 Abdul Bary ("the fifth applicant"). He is an Egyptian national who was born 
 in 1960. 
 The fifth application was lodged on 22 December 2009 by Mr Khaled 
 Al-Fawwaz ("the sixth applicant"). He is a Saudi Arabian national who was 
 born in 1962. 
 3. The first, second, third and fifth applicants were represented by 
 Ms G. Peirce, a lawyer practising in London with Birnberg Peirce & 
 Partners, assisted by Mr B. Cooper, counsel. The fourth applicant was 
 represented by Ms M. Arani, a lawyer practising in Middlesex, assisted by 
 Mr A. Jones QC and Mr B. Brandon, counsel. The sixth applicant was 
 represented by Mr A. Raja, a lawyer practising in London with Quist 
 EFTA00031735
2 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 Solicitors, assisted by Mr J. Jones, counsel. The Government were 
 represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and 
 Commonwealth Office. 
 4. The applicants, who are the subject of extradition requests made by 
 the United States of America, alleged in particular that, if extradited and 
 convicted in the United States, they would be at real risk of ill-treatment 
 either as a result of conditions of detention at ADX Florence (which would 
 be made worse by the imposition of "special administrative measures") or 
 by the length of their possible sentences. 
 5. On 6 July 2010 the Court delivered its admissibility decision in 
 respect of the first four applicants. 
 It declared admissible the first, second and third applicants' complaints 
 concerning detention at ADX Florence and the imposition of special 
 administrative measures post-trial. It declared the fourth applicant's 
 complaint in respect of ADX Florence inadmissible, finding that, as a result 
 of his medical conditions (see paragraph 37 below), there was no real risk of 
 his spending anything more than a short period of time at ADX Florence. 
 The Court also declared admissible all four applicants' complaints 
 concerning the length of their possible sentences. It declared inadmissible 
 the remainder of the applicants' complaints. 
 Finally, the Court decided to continue to indicate to the Government 
 under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it was desirable in the interests of 
 the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicants should not be 
 extradited until further notice. 
 6. On 3 September 2010, the President of the Chamber decided, under 
 Rule 54 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court, that notice of the fifth and sixth 
 applicants' cases should be given to the Government of the United 
 Kingdom. It was further decided that the Rule 39 indications made in 
 respect of these applicants should also remain in place until further notice. 
 7. Further to the Court's admissibility decision of 6 July 2010 and the 
 President's decision of 3 September 2010, all six applicants and the 
 Government filed observations (Rules 54 § 2 (b) and 59 § I). In addition, 
 third -party comments were received from the non-governmental 
 organisations the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Litigation 
 Project at Yale Law School, Interights and Reprieve, which had been given 
 leave by the President of the Chamber to intervene in the written procedure 
 (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2). The parties replied to 
 those comments (Rule 44 § 5). 
 EFTA00031736
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 3 
 THE FACTS 
 I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES 
 A. The United States indictments 
 8. The applicants have been indicted on various charges of terrorism in 
 the United States of America. They are the subject of three separate sets of 
 criminal proceedings in the United States federal courts. The first set 
 concerns the first applicant, Mr Ahmad, and the third applicant, Mr Ahsan. 
 The second set of proceedings concerns the second applicant, Mr Aswat, 
 and the fourth applicant, Abu Hamza. The third set of proceedings concerns 
 the fifth applicant, Mr Bary, and the sixth applicant, Mr Al Fawwaz. 
 9. The details of each indictment are set out below. On the basis of each 
 indictment, the United States Government requested each applicant's 
 extradition from the United Kingdom. Each applicant then contested his 
 proposed extradition in separate proceedings in the English courts. 
 I. The indictment concerning the first and third applicants 
 10. The indictment against the first applicant was returned by a Federal 
 Grand Jury sitting in Connecticut on 6 October 2004. It alleges the 
 commission of four felonies between 1997 and August 2004: conspiracy to 
 provide material support to terrorists; providing material support to 
 terrorists; conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage 
 property in a foreign country; and money laundering. On 28 June 2006, a 
 similar indictment was returned against the third applicant, save that the 
 charge of money laundering was not included. For both indictments, the 
 material support is alleged to have been provided through a series of 
 websites, one of whose servers was based in Connecticut. The charge of 
 conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage property in a 
 foreign country is based on two allegations: first, that the websites exhorted 
 Muslims to travel to Chechnya and Afghanistan to defend those places; and 
 second, that classified US Navy plans relating to a US naval battle group 
 operating in the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf had been sent to the 
 website. The plans are alleged to have discussed the battle group's 
 vulnerability to terrorist attack. 
 2. The indictment concerning the second and fourth applicants 
 11. The indictment against the fourth applicant was returned on 
 19 April 2004 by a Federal Grand Jury sitting in the Southern District of 
 EFTA00031737
Contrary to the government's misrepresentations, Boies Schiller did foment the 
 investigation (or at least it tried to). And the evidence of "collusion" between the government 
 and Boies Schiller was ample, tracing to at least early 2016 and precisely designed to have 
 Maxwell charged with perjury.6piadudge McMahon known the truth, she ike y 
 wou d have) 
 periled the government's application to modify the v. Maxwell Protective Order, and thej 
 'government wou d have been unab e to secure a copy o 
 e, Inc uding Maxwe 's two deposition transcripts 
 Boles Schi er s ninety-thousand-page) 
 E. Judge Netburn Separately Rejects An Identical Gambit By The 
 Government 
 Around the same time that Judge McMahon granted the government's ex parte request, 
 Magistrate Judge Netbum rejected an identical request from the government in a different civil 
 case, Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, Case No. 17-cv-616 (JGK) (SN). Judge Netburn recognized the 
 government's conduct for what it was: an attempt to deprive Maxwell of notice and an 
 opportunity to be heard. Ex. H. Indeed, Judge Netbum rebuffed the government even after it 
 alerted her to Judge McMahon's order. Ex. I. As Judge Netbum found, the government's 
 "abstract concern" about the "secrecy" of its investigation—a concern that exists with any 
 investigation and is hardly unique to this case—could not overcome the parties' reasonable 
 reliance on the Protective Order or justify the government's secret, ex parte application . Ex. H, p 
 6. Judge Netburn also implicitly recognized what Judge McMahon never knew—that Boies 
 Schiller was all too eager for the government to investigate and prosecute Maxwell: 
 6 Maxwell has not yet been provided discovery of whether Boies Schiller shared actual sealed 
 materials or the contents of sealed materials during its meetings with the United States Attorney's Office 
 in 2016. As noted below, the bare minimum that is required here is an evidentiary hearing to probe the 
 extent to which Boies Schiller "colluded," in a Chemical Bank sense, with the prosecutor's office.

4 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 New York. It charges him with eleven different counts of criminal conduct. 
 These cover three sets of facts. 
 12. The first group of charges relates to the taking of sixteen hostages in 
 Yemen in December 1998, four of whom died during a rescue mission 
 conducted by Yemeni forces. The indictment charges the fourth applicant 
 with conspiracy to take hostages and hostage taking and relates principally 
 to his contact with the leader of the hostage takers, Abu Al-Hassan, before 
 and during the events in question. 
 13. The second group of charges relates to the conduct of violent jihad 
 in Afghanistan in 2001. The indictment alleges that the fourth applicant 
 provided material and financial assistance to his followers and arranged for 
 them to meet Taliban commanders in Afghanistan. In this respect, four 
 counts of the indictment charge him with providing and concealing material 
 support and resources to terrorists and a foreign terrorist organisation and 
 conspiracy thereto. A further count charges him with conspiracy to supply 
 goods and services to the Taliban. 
 14. The third group of charges relates to a conspiracy to establish a jihad 
 training camp in Bly, Oregon between June 2000 and December 2001. 
 Two counts charge the fourth applicant with providing and concealing 
 material support and resources to terrorists and providing material support 
 and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation (Al Qaeda); a further two 
 counts charge him with conspiracy to the main two counts. 
 15. On 12 September 2005, a superseding indictment was returned 
 which named and indicted the second applicant as the fourth applicant's 
 alleged co-conspirator in respect of the Bly, Oregon charges (thus charging 
 the second applicant with the same four counts as those faced by the fourth 
 applicant in respect of the Bly, Oregon conspiracy). On 6 February 2006 a 
 second superseding indictment was returned, which indicted a third man, 
 Oussama Abdullah Kassir, as a co-conspirator in respect of the Bly, Oregon 
 charges. 
 16. Mr Kassir was extradited to the United States from the Czech 
 Republic in September 2007. On 12 May 2009, Mr Kassir was convicted on 
 five counts relating to the Bly, Oregon jihad camp conspiracy. He was also 
 convicted of a further six counts relating to the operation of terrorist 
 websites. On 15 September 2009, after submissions from Mr Kassir and his 
 defence counsel, the trial judge sentenced Mr Kassir to the maximum 
 permissible sentence on each count. As a life sentence was the maximum 
 permissible sentence on two of the counts, Mr Kassir had effectively been 
 sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. 
 3. The indictment concerning the fifth and sixth applicants 
 17. In 1999 a Federal Grand Jury sitting in the Southern District of New 
 York returned an indictment against Osama bin Laden and twenty other 
 individuals, including the applicants, inter alia alleging various degrees of 
 EFTA00031738
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 5 
 involvement in or support for the bombing of the United States embassies in 
 Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998. 
 18. The fifth applicant is charged with four counts: conspiracy to kill 
 United States nationals, conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to destroy 
 buildings and property, and conspiracy to attack national defence utilities. 
 19. The sixth applicant is charged with two hundred and eighty-five 
 counts of criminal conduct, including over two hundred and sixty-nine 
 counts of murder. 
 B. The applicants' extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom 
 I. Extradition proceedings against the first applicant 
 20. The first applicant was arrested in London on 5 August 2004. On 
 23 March 2005, the United States Embassy in London issued Diplomatic 
 Note No. 25. Where relevant, the note provides: 
 "Pursuant to Article IV of the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the 
 United States and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
 Northern Ireland, the Government of the United States hereby assures the Government 
 of the United Kingdom that the United States will neither seek the death penalty 
 against, nor will the death penalty be carried out, against Babar Ahmad upon his 
 extradition to the United States. 
 The Government of the United States further assures the Government of the United 
 Kingdom that upon extradition to the United States, Babar Ahmad will be prosecuted 
 before a Federal Court in accordance with the full panoply of rights and protections 
 that would otherwise be provided to a defendant facing similar charges. 
 Pursuant to his extradition, Babar Ahmad will not be prosecuted before a military 
 commission, as specified in the President's Military Order of November 13, 2001; nor 
 will he be criminally prosecuted in any tribunal or court other than a United States 
 Federal Court; nor will he be treated or designated as an enemy combatant..." 
 21. Similar Diplomatic Notes were provided in respect of the other 
 applicants in the course of their respective extradition proceedings. 
 22. At the extradition hearing before the Senior District Judge, the first 
 applicant argued, inter alia, that, notwithstanding the Diplomatic Note, the 
 risk of the death penalty being imposed remained since he could be tried on 
 a superseding indictment. He further argued that he remained at risk of 
 being designated as an "enemy combatant" pursuant to United States 
 Military Order No. 1 and that he remained at risk of extraordinary rendition 
 to a third country. He also argued that there was a substantial risk that he 
 would be subjected to special administrative measures whilst in detention in 
 a federal prison, which could involve, among other measures, solitary 
 confinement in violation of Article 3 and restrictions on communication 
 with lawyers in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. 
 EFTA00031739
6 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 23. In a decision given on 17 May 2005, the Senior District Judge ruled 
 that the extradition could proceed and that, inter alia, the first applicant's 
 extradition would not be incompatible with his rights under the Convention. 
 The Senior District Judge found that, on the basis of the Diplomatic Note, 
 there was no risk that the death penalty would be imposed, that the applicant 
 would be designated as an enemy combatant, or subjected to extraordinary 
 rendition. The Senior District Judge found the application of special 
 administrative measures to be the greatest ground for concern but concluded 
 that, having regard to the safeguards accompanying such measures, there 
 would be no breach of the applicant's Convention rights. 
 24. The Senior District Judge concluded as follows: 
 "This is a difficult and troubling case. The [first applicant] is a British subject who is 
 alleged to have committed offences which, if the evidence were available, could have 
 been prosecuted in this country. Nevertheless the Government of the United States are 
 entitled to seek his extradition under the terms of the Treaty and I am satisfied that 
 none of the statutory bars [to extradition] apply." 
 Accordingly, he sent the case to the Secretary of State for his decision as 
 to whether the first applicant should be extradited. 
 25. On 15 November 2005, the Secretary of State (Mr Charles Clarke) 
 ordered the first applicant's extradition. The first applicant appealed to the 
 High Court (see paragraphs 29 et seq. below). 
 2. Extradition proceedings against the second applicant 
 26. On 7 August 2005 the second applicant was arrested in the United 
 Kingdom, also on the basis of an arrest warrant issued under section 73 of 
 the Extradition Act 2003, following a request for his provisional arrest by 
 the United States. 
 27. The Senior District Judge gave his decision in the second applicant's 
 case on 5 January 2006. He concluded that none of the bars to extradition 
 applied, and sent the case to the Secretary of State for his decision as to 
 whether the second applicant should be extradited. 
 28. On 1 March 2006, the Secretary of State ordered his extradition. The 
 second applicant appealed to the High Court. 
 3. The first and second applicants' appeals to the High Court 
 29. The first and second applicants' appeals were heard together. In its 
 judgment of 30 November 2006, the High Court rejected their appeals. The 
 High Court found that, according to the case-law of this Court, solitary 
 confinement did not in itself constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. 
 Applying that approach, the evidence before it — which included an affidavit 
 from a United States Department of Justice official outlining the operation 
 of special administrative measures — did not "begin to establish a concrete 
 case under Article 3". 
 EFTA00031740
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 7 
 30. The first and second applicants applied for permission to appeal to 
 the House of Lords. This was refused by the House of Lords on 
 6 June 2007. 
 4. Extradition proceedings against the third applicant 
 31. The United States formally requested the extradition of the third 
 applicant on 15 September 2006. The extradition hearing started on 
 20 November 2006 on which date the Senior District Judge determined that 
 the third applicant was accused of offences for which he could be 
 extradited. The case was then adjourned for evidence and argument, 
 inter alia as to whether the third applicant's extradition would be 
 compatible with his Convention rights. The hearing resumed on 19 March 
 2007. By now bound by the High Court's judgment in respect of the first 
 and second applicants, the Senior District Judge found that the third 
 applicant's extradition would be compatible with the Convention. 
 He accordingly sent the case to the Secretary of State for his decision as to 
 whether the third applicant should be extradited. 
 32. On 14 June 2007, the Secretary of State (Dr John Reid) ordered that 
 the extradition could proceed. The third applicant appealed against this 
 decision to the High Court and also sought judicial review of the alleged 
 failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales ("the 
 DPP") to consider whether he should instead be tried in the United 
 Kingdom. He relied on guidance agreed between the Attorney General of 
 the United States and his United Kingdom counterparts for handling 
 criminal cases with concurrent jurisdiction between the United Kingdom 
 and the United States (see paragraph 63 below). 
 33. On 10 April 2008 the High Court dismissed the third applicant's 
 human rights appeal, relying on its ruling in respect of the first and second 
 applicants. In the same judgment, it also dismissed his application for 
 judicial review, finding that the guidance had no application to the third 
 applicant's case. The guidance only applied to cases where there had been 
 an investigation of the case in the United Kingdom and the DPP had been 
 seized of the case as prosecutor. 
 34. On 14 May 2008 the High Court refused to certify a point of law of 
 general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of 
 Lords and also refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. 
 5. Extradition proceedings against the fourth applicant 
 35. The United States requested the fourth applicant's extradition on 
 21 May 2004. He was arrested in London on 5 August 2004. 
 36. The extradition proceedings were adjourned when he was convicted 
 of offences in the United Kingdom and sentenced to seven years' 
 imprisonment (see Mustafa (Abu Hama) v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) 
 EFTA00031741
8 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 (dec.), no. 31411/07, 18 January 2011). The extradition proceedings 
 resumed when the criminal appeals process was concluded. 
 a. The District Court proceedings 
 37. When the case came before the Senior District Judge for his decision 
 as to whether the extradition could proceed, the fourth applicant argued, 
 inter alia, that his extradition would give rise to a real risk of a violation of 
 Article 3 of the Convention since he would be likely to be detained in a 
 "supermax" detention facility such as the United States Penitentiary, 
 Administrative Maximum, Florence, Colorado ("ADX Florence"). In this 
 connection, he also relied on his poor health, specifically his type-two 
 diabetes, his high blood pressure, the loss of sight in his right eye and poor 
 vision in his left, the amputation of both his forearms (which frequently led 
 to infections through abrasions), psoriasis on much of his body, 
 hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating). A violation of Article 3, he claimed, 
 would also result from the imposition of special administrative measures. 
 38. The Senior District Judge, in his ruling of 15 November 2007, 
 rejected all these submissions. In respect of detention at ADX Florence the 
 Senior District Judge found that the fourth applicant's poor health and 
 disabilities would be considered and, at worst, he would only be detained 
 there for a relatively short period of time. The Senior District Judge was 
 also not satisfied that special administrative measures would be applied to 
 the fourth applicant but even if they were, he was bound by the ruling of the 
 High Court in respect of the first and second applicants. Having concluded 
 that none of the bars to extradition applied, the Senior District Judge sent 
 the case to the Secretary of State (Ms Jacqui Smith) for her decision as to 
 whether the fourth applicant should be extradited. She ordered his 
 extradition on 7 February 2008. The fourth applicant appealed to the 
 High Court against the Secretary of State's decision and against the decision 
 of the Senior District Judge. 
 b. The High Court proceedings 
 39. Before the High Court, the fourth applicant again relied on his 
 submission that conditions of detention at ADX Florence would not comply 
 with Article 3. He also argued that the length of the possible sentence he 
 faced in the United States would be contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. 
 40. The High Court gave its judgment on 20 June 2008, dismissing the 
 fourth applicant's appeal. In relation to Article 3, the High Court found that, 
 if convicted, the fourth applicant would be sentenced to very lengthy terms 
 of imprisonment and that, in all likelihood, a life sentence would be 
 imposed. It found that this, of itself, would not constitute a breach of Article 
 3. On the question of the compatibility of detention at ADX Florence with 
 Article 3, the High Court relied in particular on the understanding of the 
 prison warden, Mr Robert Wiley, to the effect that if, after a full medical 
 EFTA00031742
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 9 
 evaluation, it was determined that the fourth applicant could not manage his 
 activities of daily living, it would be highly unlikely that he would be placed 
 at ADX Florence rather than at a medical centre. Accordingly, there was no 
 risk of a violation of Article 3 on this ground. However, the High Court 
 added: 
 "[T]he constitution of the United States of America guarantees not only 'due 
 process', but it also prohibits 'cruel and unusual punishment'. As part of the judicial 
 process prisoners, including those incarcerated in Supermax prisons, are entitled to 
 challenge the conditions in which they are confined, and these challenges have, on 
 occasions, met with success. 
 We should add that, subject to detailed argument which may be advanced in another 
 case, like Judge Workman [the Senior District Judge], we too are troubled about what 
 we have read about the conditions in some of the Supermax prisons in the United 
 States. Naturally, the most dangerous criminals should expect to be incarcerated in the 
 most secure conditions, but even allowing for a necessarily wide margin of 
 appreciation between the views of different civilised countries about the conditions in 
 which prisoners should be detained, confinement for years and years in what 
 effectively amounts to isolation may well be held to be, if not torture, then ill 
 treatment which contravenes Article 3. This problem may fall to be addressed in a 
 different case." 
 41. The fourth applicant then applied to the High Court for a certificate 
 of points of law of general public importance and for leave to appeal to the 
 House of Lords. On 23 July 2008, the High Court refused both applications. 
 6. Extradition proceedings against the fifth and sixth applicants 
 42. The United States Government requested the fifth and sixth 
 applicants' extradition from the United Kingdom in July 1999 and 
 September 1998 respectively. 
 a. The initial extradition proceedings 
 43. At his committal hearing before the District Court, the sixth 
 applicant contended that extradition was only permitted within the terms of 
 the 1972 USA-UK Extradition Treaty for offences committed within the 
 jurisdiction of the requesting State, and not when that State exercised 
 jurisdiction over extra-territorial offences. He further argued that there was 
 "insufficient evidence" to prove a prima facie case, which was a 
 requirement for extradition under the Treaty. As part of that submission, he 
 sought to have excluded two anonymous witness statements, which had 
 been provided by two informants, "CS/1" and "CS/2", and which the United 
 States Government relied upon as part of their case against him. It was later 
 revealed that CS/1 was a Mr Al-Fadl who had given evidence against the 
 certain of the applicants' co-defendants during their trial in the United 
 States. 
 EFTA00031743
10 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 44. In his ruling of 8 September 1999, the District Judge rejected these 
 submissions. He considered that the proper construction of the Treaty did 
 not prevent the exercise of jurisdiction over extra-territorial offences. The 
 District Judge was also satisfied that there were real grounds for fear if the 
 identities of CS/1 and CS/2 were revealed. Thus, their anonymous witness 
 statements could be admitted as evidence of a prima facie case. He further 
 found that there was a case for the sixth applicant to answer. 
 45. The sixth applicant appealed to the High Court by way of an 
 application for a writ of habeas corpus. The application was dismissed on 
 30 November 2000. The High Court held that it was necessary to show that 
 the crime in respect of which extradition was sought was alleged to have 
 been committed within the actual territory of the United States. The 
 High Court was, however, satisfied that three overt acts alleged by the 
 United States of America could be relied on to found territorial jurisdiction 
 in the United States, namely (a) the setting up and operating of a secure 
 telephone line in the United States by the sixth applicant through an 
 organisation called MCI; (b) the purchase by the sixth applicant of a satellite 
 phone system in the United States and (c) the issuing, in pursuance of the 
 conspiracy of fatwas and jihads, allegedly prepared with the concurrence of 
 the sixth applicant in the United States and elsewhere. The High Court also 
 found that the District Judge had not erred in admitting the evidence of CS/1 
 or in finding that there was a prima facie case against the sixth applicant. It 
 did not consider it necessary reach any conclusions in respect of CS/2, 
 judging CS/1's evidence to be "far the most significant". 
 46. While the sixth applicant's appeal was pending before the 
 High Court, a committal hearing before the District Court was held in 
 respect of the fifth applicant. The District Judge gave his ruling on 25 April 
 2000 in which he reaffirmed the rulings he had made in respect of the sixth 
 applicant and found that there was also a prima facie case against the fifth 
 applicant. 
 47. The fifth applicant also appealed to the High Court and, on 2 May 
 2001, a differently constituted court dismissed his appeal. Again the 
 High Court found that the District Judge had not erred in admitting the 
 anonymous evidence of CS/1; that there was sufficient evidence against the 
 fifth applicant for the extradition to proceed, and that the United States had 
 jurisdiction to try him. 
 48. Both applicants appealed to the House of Lords. Their appeals were 
 dismissed on 17 December 2001. The House of Lords found unanimously 
 that the High Court had erred in its finding in respect of jurisdiction: it was 
 sufficient that the offence for which extradition was sought was triable 
 within the United States and an equivalent offence would be triable in the 
 United Kingdom. Accordingly, the applicants were liable to extradition to 
 the United States if a prima facie case of conspiracy to murder was 
 established. This was the case for each applicant. 
 EFTA00031744
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT II 
 b. The Secretary of State's decision, the United States' assurances, and the 
 fifth and sixth applicants' appeal to the High Court 
 49. Between November 2001 and December 2005 there then followed 
 voluminous representations by the fifth and sixth applicants to the Secretary 
 of State as to why they should not be extradited to the United States. 
 50. In the course of these exchanges, on 19 April 2002 the President of 
 the United States designated the sixth applicant as a "specially designated 
 global terrorist", which had the effect of placing him on a list of persons 
 maintained by the United States Department of the Treasury and available 
 on its website. This was done pursuant to Executive Order 13224 which 
 enables the American assets of any person so designated to be blocked. 
 51. Subsequently, on 13 April 2004, the United States Embassy in 
 London issued Diplomatic Note No. 018, which gave assurances that the 
 United States Government would neither seek nor carry out the death 
 penalty against the fifth and sixth applicants. It also gave assurances that 
 they would be tried before a federal court and that they would not be 
 prosecuted by a military commission or designated as enemy combatants. 
 On 18 January 2008, the United States Embassy issued Diplomatic Note 
 No. 002, which assured the United Kingdom Government that, if either 
 applicant were acquitted or completed any sentence imposed or if the 
 prosecution against them were discontinued, the United States authorities 
 would return the men to the United Kingdom, if they so requested. 
 52. The Secretary of State (Ms Jacqui Smith) rejected the fifth and sixth 
 applicants' representations on 12 March 2008. She found that assurances 
 given by the United States in the Diplomatic Note of 13 April 2004 could be 
 relied upon and thus that the fifth and sixth applicants were not at risk of the 
 death penalty, indefinite detention or trial by a military commission. 
 53. The fifth and sixth applicants also contended that they would not 
 receive a fair trial in the United States owing to the unavailability of defence 
 witnesses and evidence, adverse publicity, the possible imposition of special 
 administrative measures before trial, and the sixth applicant's designation as 
 a global terrorist. The Secretary of State found none of these claims 
 amounted to a "flagrant denial of justice" such as would act as a bar to 
 extradition. 
 54. The Secretary of State accepted that there was a real possibility that 
 they would be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted but, relying on 
 the House of Lords' judgment in R (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the 
 Home Department (see paragraphs 64-72 below), found that this would not 
 amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. 
 55. The Secretary of State also considered that the conditions of the fifth 
 and sixth applicants' detention in the United States would not violate Article 
 3 whether they were subjected to "special administrative measures" before 
 trial or detained at ADX Florence after trial. In the fifth applicant's case, 
 this conclusion was not affected by the fact that he suffered from a recurrent 
 EFTA00031745
12 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 depressive disorder. There was also no risk that either applicant would be 
 tortured, that evidence obtained by torture would be adduced at trial, or that 
 they would be at real risk of torture as a result of extraordinary rendition or 
 refoulement to a third State. 
 56. The fifth and sixth applicants sought judicial review of the Secretary 
 of State's decision in the High Court. Before the High Court the applicants 
 submitted that, if convicted, they would be detained at ADX Florence in 
 violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In rejecting that contention, Lord 
 Justice Scott Baker, delivering the judgment of the court on 7 August 2009, 
 found that the decisions of the United States federal courts in Ajaj, Sattar 
 and Wilkinson v. Austin (see paragraphs 109 and 110 below) demonstrated 
 that there was effective judicial oversight of "supermax" prisons such as 
 ADX. The fifth and sixth applicants would also have the possibility of 
 entering ADX's "step down program" (see paragraphs 84-88 below). He 
 concluded: 
 (1) It is reasonably likely that the claimants will be subjected to [special 
 administrative measures] and will be held in ADX Florence following trial. 
 (2) Neither [special administrative measures] (see Alunad and Aswat) or life 
 without parole (see Wellington) cross the article 3 threshold in the present case. 
 Although near to the borderline the prison conditions at ADX Florence, although very 
 harsh do not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment either on their own or in 
 combination with [special administrative measures] and in the context of a whole life 
 sentence. 
 (3) Whether the high article 3 threshold for inhuman or degrading treatment is 
 crossed depends on the facts of the particular case. There is no common standard for 
 what does or does not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment throughout the 
 many different countries in the world. The importance of maintaining extradition in a 
 case where the fugitive would not otherwise be tried is an important factor in 
 identifying the threshold in the present race. 
 Had the claimants persuaded me that there was no prospect that they would ever 
 enter the step down procedure whatever the circumstances then in my view the article 
 3 threshold would be crossed. But that is not the case. The evidence satisfies me that 
 the authorities will faithfully apply the criteria [for entry to the program] and that the 
 stringency of the conditions it imposes will continue to be linked to the risk the 
 prisoner presents. Further, there is access to the US courts in the event that the 
 [Federal Bureau of prisons] acts unlawfully." 
 57. In respect of the fifth applicant's submission that his recurrent 
 depressive illness would deteriorate if extradited, the High Court considered 
 that, to the extent that this affected his fitness to stand trial, this was a matter 
 for the United States' authorities and, if he were convicted, the fifth 
 applicant's mental health would be an important factor in deciding whether 
 he should be sent to ADX Florence. 
 58. The High Court also rejected the fifth and sixth applicants' 
 submissions that they were at real risk of violations of Articles 3, 6 and 14 
 EFTA00031746
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 13 
 of the Convention by virtue of the imposition of special administrative 
 measures, relying on its previous judgment in respect of the first and second 
 applicants (see paragraph 29 above). Having regard to the Diplomatic Note 
 of 18 January 2008, the High Court found that there was no real risk of 
 refoulement to Egypt or Saudi Arabia by the United States. The High Court 
 was also satisfied that the United States would honour the assurances it had 
 given in the Diplomatic Note of 13 April 2004. The mere fact that the sixth 
 applicant had been designated as a global terrorist by the President of the 
 United States did not mean he was at risk of a flagrant denial of justice 
 within the meaning of Article 6: the designation added little to what was 
 already known about him; it would be made clear to the jury at any trial 
 what had to be proved as regards the indictment. 
 59. The High Court also rejected the applicants' submission that they 
 should be tried in the United Kingdom, finding that this was neither viable 
 nor appropriate and that any connection with the United Kingdom was 
 "tenuous indeed". 
 60. Although the High Court refused leave to appeal to the United 
 Kingdom Supreme Court, it certified two questions of general public 
 importance. The first question was whether prison conditions at ADX 
 Florence were compatible with Article 3; the second question was whether 
 the relativist approach to Article 3 adopted by the majority of the House of 
 Lords in Wellington should apply where the issue under Article 3 was one 
 of the compatibility of prison conditions with Article 3. 
 61. On 16 December 2009, the Supreme Court refused permission to 
 appeal. 
 II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW ON 
 ARTICLE 3 AND EXTRADTITION 
 A. Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the 
 United States 
 62. At the material time, the applicable bilateral treaty on extradition 
 was the 1972 UK — USA Extradition Treaty (now superseded by a 2003 
 treaty). Article IV of the 1972 treaty provided that extradition could be 
 refused unless the requesting Party gave assurances satisfactory to the 
 requested Party that the death penalty would not be carried out. 
 63. Guidance for handling criminal cases with concurrent jurisdiction 
 between the United Kingdom and the United States of America was signed 
 on 18 January 2007 by the Attorney General of the United States of 
 America, Her Majesty's Attorney General and also, for its application to 
 Scotland, by the Lord Advocate. It sets out a series of measures that 
 prosecutors in each State should take to exchange information and consult 
 EFTA00031747
fl'The extraordinary posture of the case requires the Court to police carefully 
 government intrusions into areas of protections agreed to by civil litigants and so-
 ordered by the Court. The Government is attempting to side-step these protections 
 by serving a subpoena only upon a party who is willing (and perhaps eager) to 
 comply with the Government's investigation. 
 Ex. H, p 6. 
 ARGUMENT 
 A. Pursuant To Its Inherent Power, This Court Should Suppress The 
 Evidence Obtained From Boies Schiller, And Dismiss Counts Five And 
 Six, Which Are The Fruits Of That Evidence 
 1. The role of protective orders in civil litigation. 
 Protective orders serve a "vital function" in civil litigation. Martindell v. Intl Tel. & Tel. 
 Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir. 1979). They promote "the `secure the just, speedy, and 
 inexpensive determination' of civil disputes, by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence." Id. 
 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1). "If protective orders were easily modified . . . parties would be less 
 forthcoming in giving testimony and less willing to settle their disputes." S.E.C. v. 
 TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 230 (2d Cir. 2001). In particular, as here, "witnesses might be 
 expected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective orders if their testimony were to be 
 made available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those 
 orders." Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295-96. Parties thus rely on protective orders, and courts strictly 
 enforce them. See, e.g., Stewart v. Hudson Hall LLC, 20 Civ. 885 (SLC), 2020 WL 7239676, at 
 *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2020) ("In the Second Circuit, there is a strict standard for modification of 
 a protective order entered by a district court." (citation and quotation marks omitted)). 
 This case illustrates just how crucial a protective order is. The Maxwell depositions 
 sought highly intrusive evidence of the most personal aspects of Maxwell's life. Her sexual 
 practices. Her sexual preferences. Her sexual partners. In urging the district court to permit these 
 extraordinary intrusions—in what should have been a simple defamation case-Boies Schiller 
 11 
 EFTA00029831
14 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 each other in such cases and to determine issues which arise from 
 concurrent jurisdiction. A case with concurrent jurisdiction is defined as one 
 which has the potential to be prosecuted in both the United Kingdom and 
 the United States. 
 B. Relevant United Kingdom law on Article 3 and extradition: R 
 (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] 
 UKHL 72 
 64. The United States requested the extradition of Ralston Wellington 
 from the United Kingdom to stand trial in Missouri on two counts of murder 
 in the first degree. In his appeal against extradition, Mr Wellington argued 
 that his surrender would violate Article 3 of the Convention, on the basis 
 that there was a real risk that he would be subjected to inhuman and 
 degrading treatment in the form of a sentence of life imprisonment without 
 parole. 
 65. In giving judgment in the High Court ([2007] EWHC 1109 
 (Admin)), Lord Justice Laws found that there were "powerful arguments of 
 penal philosophy" which suggested that risk of a whole-life sentence 
 without parole intrinsically violated Article 3 of the Convention. He 
 observed: 
 "The abolition of the death penalty has been lauded, and justified, in many ways; but 
 it must have been founded at least on the premise that the life of every person, 
 however depraved, has an inalienable value. The destruction of a life may be accepted 
 in some special circumstances, such as self-defence or just war; but retributive 
 punishment is never enough to justify it. Yet a prisoner's incarceration without hope 
 of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death. He can never atone 
 for his offence. However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life, 
 his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath. Like the death sentence the 
 whole -life tariff is lex talionis. But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for 
 which it is visited on the prisoner (the only virtue of the lex talionis) is a poor 
 guarantee of proportionate punishment, for the whole-life tariff is arbitrary: it may be 
 measured in days or decades according to how long the prisoner has to live. It is 
 therefore liable to be disproportionate — the very vice which is condemned on 
 Article 3 grounds — unless, of course, the death penalty's logic applies: the crime is so 
 heinous it can never be atoned for. But in that case the supposed inalienable value of 
 the prisoner's life is reduced, merely, to his survival: to nothing more than his drawing 
 breath and being kept, no doubt, confined in decent circumstances. That is to pay lip-
 service to the value of life; not to vouchsafe it." 
 However, and "not without misgivings", he considered that the relevant 
 authorities, including those of this Court, suggested an irreducible life 
 sentence would not always raise an Article 3 issue. 
 66. Wellington's appeal from that judgment was heard by the House of 
 Lords and dismissed on 10 December 2008. Central to the appeal was 
 paragraph 89 of this Court's judgment in Soering v. the United Kingdom, 
 EFTA00031748
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 15 
 7 July 1989, § 89, Series A no. 161, where the Court stated that 
 considerations in favour of extradition: 
 ".. must also be included among the factors to be taken into account in the 
 interpretation and application of the notions of inhuman and degrading treatment or 
 punishment in extradition cases." 
 67. A majority of their Lordships, Lord Hoffmann, Baroness Hale and 
 Lord Carswell, found that, on the basis of this paragraph, in the extradition 
 context, a distinction had to be drawn between torture and lesser forms of 
 ill-treatment. When there was a real risk of torture, the prohibition on 
 extradition was absolute and left no room for a balancing exercise. 
 However, insofar as Article 3 applied to inhuman and degrading treatment 
 and not to torture, it was applicable only in a relativist form to extradition 
 cases. 
 68. Lord Hoffmann, giving the lead speech, considered the Court's 
 judgment in the case of Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, 
 § 81, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, in which the Court 
 stated that: 
 "It should not be inferred from the Court's remarks tat paragraph 89 of Soeringl that 
 there is any room for balancing the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons for 
 expulsion in determining whether a State's responsibility under Article 3 (art. 3) is 
 engaged." 
 Lord Hoffmann stated: 
 "In the context of Chahal, I read this remark as affirming that there can be no room 
 for a balancing of risk against reasons for expulsion when it comes to subjecting 
 someone to the risk of torture. I do not however think that the Court was intending to 
 depart from the relativist approach to what counted as inhuman and degrading 
 treatment which was laid down in Soering and which is paralleled in the cases on 
 other articles of the Convention in a foreign context. If such a radical departure from 
 precedent had been intended, I am sure that the Court would have said so." 
 For Lord Hoffmann, paragraph 89 of Soering made clear that: 
 "...the desirability of extradition is a factor to be taken into account in deciding 
 whether the punishment likely to be imposed in the receiving state attains the 
 `minimum level of severity' which would make it inhuman and degrading. 
 Punishment which counts as inhuman and degrading in the domestic context will not 
 necessarily be so regarded when the extradition factor has been taken into account." 
 He went on to state: 
 "A relativist approach to the scope of article 3 seems to me essential if extradition is 
 to continue to function. For example, the Court of Session has decided in Napier v 
 Scottish Ministers (2005) SC 229 that in Scotland the practice of 'slopping out' 
 (requiring a prisoner to use a chamber pot in his cell and empty it in the morning) may 
 cause an infringement of article 3. Whether, even in a domestic context, this attains 
 the necessary level of severity is a point on which I would wish to reserve my opinion. 
 If, however, it were applied in the context of extradition, it would prevent anyone 
 being extradited to many countries, poorer than Scotland, where people who are not in 
 prison often have to make do without flush lavatories." 
 EFTA00031749
16 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 69. A minority of their Lordships, Lord Scott and Lord Brown, 
 disagreed with these conclusions. They considered that the extradition 
 context was irrelevant to the determination of whether a whole life sentence 
 amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. They found no basis in the 
 text of Article 3 for such a distinction. Lord Brown also considered that the 
 Court, in Chahal and again in Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, ECHR 
 2008-..., had departed from the previous, relativist approach to inhuman and 
 degrading treatment that it had taken in Soering. He stated: 
 "Them is, I conclude, no room in the Strasbourg jurisprudence for a concept such as 
 the risk of a flagrant violation of article 3's absolute prohibition against inhuman or 
 degrading treatment or punishment (akin to that of the risk of a 'flagrant denial of 
 justice'). By the same token that no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk 
 of torture, so too no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or 
 punishment which is properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading. That, of 
 course, is not to say that, assuming for example 'slopping out' is degrading treatment 
 in Scotland, so too it must necessarily be regarded in all countries (see pare 27 of Lord 
 Hoffmann's opinion)... the Strasbourg Court has repeatedly said that the Convention 
 does not 'purport to be a means of requiring the contracting states to impose 
 Convention standards on other states' (Soering, pan 86) and article 3 does not bar 
 removal to non-Convention states (whether by way of extradition or simply for the 
 purposes of immigration control) merely because they choose to impose higher levels 
 or harsher measures of criminal punishment. 
 Nor is it to say that a risk of article 3 ill-treatment, the necessary pre-condition of an 
 article 3 bar upon extradition, will readily be established. On the contrary, as the 
 Grand Chamber reaffirmed in Saadi at pan 142: 
 Th he Court has frequently indicated that it applies rigorous criteria and exercises 
 close scrutiny when assessing the existence of a real risk of ill-treatment . . . in the 
 event of a person being removed from the territory of the respondent State by 
 extradition, expulsion or any other measure pursuing that aim. Although assessment 
 of that risk is to some degree speculative, the Court has always been very cautious, 
 examining carefully the material placed before it in the light of the requisite 
 standard of proof . . . before . . . finding that the enforcement of removal from the 
 territory would be contrary to article 3 of the Convention. As a result, since adopting 
 the Chahal judgment it has only rarely reached such a conclusion."' 
 Therefore, for Lord Brown, if a mandatory life sentence violated 
 Article 3 in a domestic case, the risk of such a sentence would preclude 
 extradition to another country. 
 70. However, despite these different views, none of the Law Lords 
 found that the sentence likely to be imposed on Mr Wellington would be 
 irreducible; having regard to the commutation powers of the Governor of 
 Missouri, it would be just as reducible as the sentence at issue in Kafkaris 
 v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008-.... All five Law Lords also 
 noted that, in Kafkaris, the Court had only said that the imposition of an 
 irreducible life sentence may raise an issue under Article 3. They found that 
 the imposition of a whole life sentence would not constitute inhuman and 
 EFTA00031750
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 17 
 degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 per se, unless it were grossly or 
 clearly disproportionate. Lord Brown in particular noted: 
 "Having puzzled long over this question, I have finally concluded that the majority 
 of the Grand Chamber fin Kaficaris] would not regard even an irreducible life 
 sentence —by which, as explained, I understand the majority to mean a mandatory life 
 sentence to be served in full without there ever being proper consideration of the 
 individual circumstances of the defendant's case—as violating article 3 unless and 
 until the time comes when further imprisonment would no longer be justified on any 
 ground —whether for reasons of punishment, deterrence or public protection. It is for 
 that reason that the majority say only that article 3 may be engaged." 
 Lord Brown added that this test had not been met in Wellington's case, 
 particularly when the facts of the murders for which he was accused, if 
 committed in the United Kingdom, could have justified a whole life order. 
 However, Lord Brown considered that, in a more compelling case, such as 
 the mercy killing of a terminally ill relative, this Court "might well judge 
 the risk of ill-treatment to be sufficiently real, clear and imminent to 
 conclude that extradition must indeed be barred on article 3 grounds". 
 71. Finally, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Scott, Baroness Hale and Lord Brown 
 all doubted Lord Justice Laws' view that life imprisonment without parole 
 was lex tad ionis. Lord Hoffman, Baroness Hale and Lord Brown did not 
 accept his premise that the abolition of the death penalty had been founded 
 on the idea that the life of every person had an inalienable value; there were 
 other, more pragmatic reasons for abolition such as its irreversibility and 
 lack of deterrent effect. Lord Scott rejected the view that an irreducible life 
 sentence was inhuman and degrading because it denied a prisoner the 
 possibility of atonement; once it was accepted that a whole life sentence 
 could be a just punishment, atonement was achieved by the prisoner serving 
 his sentence. 
 72. Wellington's application to this Court was struck out on 5 October 
 2010, the applicant having indicated his wish to withdraw it 
 (Wellington v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 60682/08). 
 C. Relevant Canadian case-law 
 73. Section I of the Canadian Charter of Rights provides that the Charter 
 guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it "subject only to such 
 reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a 
 free and democratic society." Section 7 provides: 
 "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to 
 be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice." 
 Section 12 provides: 
 "Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or 
 punishment." 
 EFTA00031751
18 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 74. In United States v. Burns [2001] S.C.R. 283, Burns and another (the 
 respondents) were to be extradited from Canada to the State of Washington 
 to stand trial for murders allegedly committed when they were both 
 eighteen. Before making the extradition order the Canadian Minister of 
 Justice had not sought assurances that the death penalty would not be 
 imposed. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the remoteness between 
 the extradition and the potential imposition of capital punishment meant the 
 case was not appropriately considered under section 12 but under section 7. 
 However, the values underlying section 12 could form part of the balancing 
 process engaged under section 7. The extradition of the respondents would, 
 if implemented, deprive them of their rights of liberty and security of person 
 as guaranteed by section 7. The issue was whether such a deprivation was in 
 accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. While extradition 
 could only be refused if it "shocked the conscience" an extradition that 
 violated the principles of fundamental justice would always do so. The court 
 balanced the factors that favoured extradition against those that favoured 
 seeking assurances that the death penalty would not be sought. The latter 
 included the fact that a degree of leniency for youth was an accepted value 
 in the administration of justice, even for young offenders over the age of 
 eighteen. The court concluded that the objectives sought to be advanced by 
 extradition without assurances would be as well served by extradition with 
 assurances. The court held therefore that assurances were constitutionally 
 required by section 7 in all but exceptional cases. 
 75. In United States of America v. Ferras; United States of America v. 
 Laity, [2006] 2 SCR 77, the appellants were to be extradited to the United 
 States to face charges of fraud (the Ferras case) or trafficking of cocaine 
 (the Laity case). The appellants in the Laity case had argued that, if 
 extradited and convicted they could receive sentences of ten years to life 
 without parole and this would "shock the conscience". In dismissing the 
 appeals, the Supreme Court affirmed the balancing approach laid down in 
 Burns to determining whether potential sentences in a requesting state 
 would "shock the conscience". The harsher sentences the appellants might 
 receive if convicted in the United States were among the factors militating 
 against their surrender but they had offered no evidence or case-law to back 
 up their assertions that the possible sentences would shock the conscience of 
 Canadians. The factors favouring extradition far outweighed those that did 
 not. 
 D. Relevant international law on non-refoulement 
 I. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
 76. Article 7 of the ICCPR where relevant provides that "no one shall be 
 subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
 EFTA00031752
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 19 
 punishment." The Human Rights Committee's most recent general 
 comment on Article 7 (No. 20, of 10 March 1992) states the Committee's 
 view that: "States parties must not expose individuals to the danger of 
 torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return 
 to another country by way of their extradition, expulsion or refoulement." 
 (see also Chitat Ng v. Canada, CCPR/C/49/D/469/I99 1 , 7 January 1994; 
 A.J.R. v. Australia, CCPR/C/60/D/692/1996, II August 1997). 
 2. The United Nations Convention Against Torture 
 77. Article 3 § 1 of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture 
 and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
 ("UNCAT") provides: 
 "No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to 
 another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he 
 would be in danger of being subjected to torture?' 
 78. Article 16 § 2 provides: 
 "The provisions of this Convention are without prejudice to the provisions of any 
 other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or 
 degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion." 
 3. The Council of Europe Guidelines on Human Rights and the fight 
 against terrorism 
 79. The above guidelines (adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 
 11 July 2002) contain the following provisions on refoulement and 
 extradition: 
 "XII. Asylum, return (`refoulement') and expulsion 
 2. It is the duty of a State that has received a request for asylum to ensure that the 
 possible return ("refoulement") of the applicant to his/her country of origin or to 
 another country will not expose him/her to the death penalty, to torture or to inhuman 
 or degrading treatment or punishment. The same applies to expulsion. 
 XIII. Extradition 
 I. Extradition is an essential procedure for effective international co•operation in 
 the fight against terrorism. 
 3. Extradition may not be granted when there is serious reason to believe that: 
 (i) the person whose extradition has been requested will be subjected to torture or to 
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment..." 
 EFTA00031753
20 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 4. The European Union Charter 
 80. Article 19 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European 
 Union provides: 
 "No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious 
 risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or 
 degrading treatment or punishment." 
 III. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND 
 PRACTICE ON DETENTION AT ADX FLORENCE 
 A. Evidence of conditions of detention at ADX Florence 
 81. ADX Florence, a so-called "supermax" prison, is one of a number of 
 detention facilities at the Federal Correctional Complex, Florence, 
 Colorado. The parties have provided a great deal of evidence in respect of 
 conditions of detention at ADX and general facilities at FCC Florence. The 
 applicants have also submitted general evidence on "supermax" prisons and 
 their effects on prisoners. The evidence submitted may be summarised as 
 follows. 
 I. Evidence submitted by the Government 
 82. The Government submitted a series of declarations, which had been 
 prepared specifically for the present proceedings by officials at FCC/ADX 
 Florence. Thereafter, in reply to a series of questions put by the Court in 
 respect of the number of inmates entering ADX's "step down program", two 
 further letters were provided by the United States Department of Justice (see 
 paragraphs 93-97 below). 
 a. The declarations 
 83. Mr Louis J. Milusnic, the associate warden of ADX, outlined the 
 regime which was in place at the special security unit (H Unit) for inmates 
 who were subjected to special administrative measures. All cells were single 
 occupancy, had natural light and measured 75.5 square feet (approximately 
 7 square metres). Showers were not in-cell but on a shared range. 
 84. Inmates in H Unit were part of the special security unit program, 
 which had three phases that inmates could work through. 
 In phase one, the "baseline" phase, inmates had two non-legal telephone 
 calls per month, five social visits, access to a commissary list and art and 
 hobby craft items, and escorted shower time three times a week. They had 
 ten hours per week of out-of-cell recreation time (increased from five hours 
 EFTA00031754
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 21 
 per week in September 2009). As of November 2010, twelve inmates were 
 in phase one. 
 In phase two, conditions were the same save that three non-legal 
 telephone calls per month were permitted, the commissary list was 
 expanded and inmates were permitted to go to the shower unescorted, five 
 times per week. Eleven inmates were in phase two. 
 In phase three, group recreation was permitted five days a week (for a 
 minimum of one and a half hours per day, in groups of four) and the number 
 of non-legal telephone calls increased to four. Inmates ate one meal together 
 and engaged in recreational activities together for one and a half hours per 
 day. Access to showers was unrestricted and the commissary list was further 
 expanded. Four inmates, who had all been convicted of terrorist activity, 
 had progressed to phase three. 
 Advancement through the phases was authorised by a Program Screening 
 Committee, whose six-monthly reviews the inmate attended. The 
 Committee's task was to determine whether an inmate could function with 
 additional privileges without posing a security or safety risk. Advancement 
 was subject to various factors including good conduct, participation in 
 programmes recommended by the Unit, positive behaviour and respectful 
 conduct and positive overall institutional adjustment. 
 85. Recreation alternated daily between outside and inside recreation. 
 Outdoor recreation took place in adjacent individual recreation areas, which 
 allow an inmate full visual access to the recreation yard and other inmates. 
 Conversations could be carried on in a normal tone of voice and most 
 inmates spent the majority of their recreation time talking to other inmates. 
 Each individual outdoor area measured 12 feet by 20 feet (approximately 
 3.66 metres by 6 metres) and contained pull-up bars and footballs. 
 Individual indoor areas measured 14 feet by 10 feet. Recreation had only 
 been cancelled once in thirteen months for security reasons. 
 86. There was no limit on inmates' correspondence with family 
 members and special administrative measures could be modified to allow 
 correspondence beyond the immediate family. There were also no limits on 
 correspondence with legal representatives and access to a law library for up 
 to two hours at a time. Inmates received a free, daily copy of USA Today. 
 They had access to fifty television channels and seven FM radio channels. 
 They could speak to inmates in adjacent cells using the air ventilation as a 
 voice conduit. They had regular contact with prison staff — a member of the 
 Unit Team visited every inmate every day — and there were visits from 
 medical, education, religious service and psychology staff, including two 
 Arabic speakers. Inmates could request to speak with an officer at any time. 
 87. Mr Milusnic also outlined the criteria and procedures for placement 
 at ADX Florence. An inmate either had to: (i) create a security risk at other 
 correctional facilities; or (ii) as a result of his or her status, be unable to be 
 safely housed in the general population of another institution. Referral to 
 EFTA00031755
22 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 ADX was initiated by the staff at the inmate's current institution. If the 
 warden of that institution, the relevant regional director and the Bureau's 
 designation centre all concurred, a hearing took place. The inmate was 
 given written notice at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing. After the 
 hearing, a report with a recommendation was prepared and given to the 
 inmate. The final decision was taken on the basis of the report by an 
 Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, with the possibility of 
 appeal to the chief of the designation centre and thereafter the Office of the 
 General Counsel. 
 88. Ms Patricia Rangel is the Unit Manager for the General Population 
 Units at ADX. She provided two declarations. 
 Her first declaration outlined the Federal Bureau of Prisons procedures 
 for review of the status of inmates. There was an initial classification upon 
 arrival at a new Bureau institution, which took place at a meeting attended 
 by the inmate and which defined, inter alia, the work and educational 
 programmes the inmate would follow, his or her release plans, and 
 security/custody levels. Thereafter, there were six-monthly program reviews 
 (including progress review reports, which were signed by the inmate and the 
 Unit Manager) and more detailed, three-yearly progress reports, which were 
 also made available to the inmate. 
 In her declaration Ms Rangel also outlined the different levels of security 
 in ADX units and the step down program. The units followed a "stratified" 
 system of housing from General Population Units to the Intermediate, 
 Transitional and Pre-Transfer Units. It would take an inmate a minimum of 
 thirty-six months to work through the system: the minimum stay in each 
 unit was twelve months in a General Population Unit, six months in 
 Intermediate, six in Transitional and twelve in Pre-Transfer. Specific 
 conditions in each unit were as follows. 
 General Population Unit cells were 87 square feet (8 square metres) plus 
 a sallyport (exit area) of 17 square feet. Showers were within the cells. 
 There was a window with natural lighting and inmates could control the 
 lighting in their cell via a dimmer switch. Lights on the range were switched 
 off at night, but, as in all federal prisons, were briefly turned on for three 
 cell counts during the night. Meals were delivered in-cell. Inmates received 
 two fifteen minute telephone calls and up to five social visits per month. It 
 was possible and permissible for inmates to talk to each other in their cells 
 via the ventilation system or during their out-of-cell recreation. 
 Inmates had ten hours out-of-cell exercise each week in single-cell 
 recreation areas, some of which were grouped together on large recreation 
 yards. Ms Rangel gave the sizes of the two types of outdoor individualised 
 recreation areas as 240 square feet and 315 square feet (22 and 29 square 
 metres). The size of the indoor areas was 389 square feet (36 square 
 metres). Recreation privileges could be restricted for violations of rules and 
 regulations. Restrictions on outdoor recreation were in three-month 
 EFTA00031756
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 23 
 increments (three months for a first offence, six for a second offence and so 
 on). 
 Intermediate Unit cells were 75.5 square feet and did not have a sallyport 
 or shower. There was a window with natural lighting; cell doors faced out 
 onto a range. Inmates were assigned to a group of eight inmates with whom 
 they recreated. Meals were provided to inmates one group at a time, 
 meaning each group was allowed out of their cells to collect their meals in 
 the range. Inmates received three fifteen-minute telephone calls and up to 
 five social visits per month. Showers stalls were on the range, where 
 inmates could shower any time they were out on the range. 
 Transitional Units had similar conditions to Intermediate Units save that 
 inmates were assigned to groups of sixteen inmates. They received 
 twenty-one hours of out-of-cell recreation per week in their assigned group 
 on the range or in a large recreation yard. Meals were consumed in groups 
 on the range. Inmates were unrestrained when out of their cells. They 
 received an extra fifteen-minute telephone call per month and could leave 
 the unit unrestrained but escorted to purchase items from the commissary. 
 The Pre-Transfer Unit was located at another penitentiary at 
 FCC Florence. As in the Intermediate and Transitional Units, inmates ate 
 their meals and recreated within their assigned group. They received 
 twenty-four and a half hours' out-of-cell recreation time per week, and five 
 visits and three hundred minutes of telephone calls per month. 
 In the General Population, Intermediate and Transitional Units, access to 
 television, radio and books, contact with prison staff and rules on 
 correspondence were as outlined by Mr Milusnic. 
 The rules governing the step down program were set out in an 
 "institution supplement", which had been updated in September 2009. An 
 inmate's placement in and advancement through the step down program 
 were reviewed every six months, subject to the minimum periods in each 
 unit, set out above, and other criteria such as participation in defined 
 programmes, positive behaviour and overall institutional adjustment. 
 According to the updated supplement, mitigation of the original reason for 
 placement at ADX Florence was no longer a factor which was considered, 
 but the Step Down Screening Committee, which made decisions on 
 advancement, could have regard to the initial reasons for placement at ADX 
 and other safety and security factors. The final decision was one for the 
 Warden. Any negative decision had to be reasoned (unless providing 
 reasons would pose a threat to individual safety or institutional security) and 
 was subject to appeal through the Bureau's administrative remedy 
 programme. Since the implementation of the updated supplement, there had 
 been a 56% increase in movement of inmates from the four General 
 Population Units to the Intermediate Unit and a 135% increase in movement 
 from the Intermediate to the Transitional Unit. Inmates had also completed 
 EFTA00031757
expressly invoked the assurances of the Protective Order. So did the district court in permitting 
 these intrusions and ordering Maxwell to sit for a second deposition. Maxwell likewise relied on 
 the Protective Order in choosing to render such intimate details, rather than assert her Fifth 
 Amendment privilege as she had every right to do. 
 And why shouldn't Maxwell have relied on the Protective Order? The central protection 
 in the Order was that none of Maxwell's answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies 
 Schiller had expressly sought a law enforcement exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law 
 firm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell's option, to destroy it. 
 Maxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if Boies Schiller did not. 
 2. The government circumvented the protective order. 
 Faced with a duly entered Protective Order—which quite deliberately omitted any "law 
 enforcement" exception—the government had lawful options to pursue the confidential 
 discovery. It could have moved to intervene in the civil case and to amend the Protective Order. 
 It could have issued a subpoena for the materials and given Maxwell an opportunity to respond. 
 Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294. It could even have applied for a search warrant, assuming 
 (counterfactually) that it could show probable cause in support of such a warrant. 
 The government did none of those things. Instead. it initiated an ex parte proceeding and 
 secured a secret modification of the Protective Order based on material misrepresentations to the 
 presiding judge. This was not among the lawful options available to the government. 
 It cannot fairly be disputed that Judge McMahon's ruling to amend the Protective Order 
 was based on the government's misrepresentations. Immediately before issuing her decision, 
 Judge McMahon held a hearing with the sole purpose of asking the prosecutor, point blank, 
 about the government's contacts with Boies Schiller. Judge McMahon's stated reason for so 
 inquiring was to ensure that the government and Boies Schiller had not coordinated as the parties 
 12 
 EFTA00029832
24 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 the programme and been transferred out of ADX Florence. This included 
 Arab -Muslim inmates. 
 89. Mr Christopher B. Synsvoll is the Department of Justice Supervising 
 Attorney at FCC Florence. His declaration outlined the application of 
 special administrative measures. These measures were rare: of 210,307 
 Federal Bureau of Prison inmates, forty-one were subjected to them; 
 twenty-seven of the forty-one were in H Unit at ADX Florence. Special 
 administrative measures could be challenged through the Bureau's 
 administrative remedy programme, which led to a review of the need for the 
 measures and which involved consultation with other agencies such as the 
 FBI. This process had, on occasion, led to the modification of certain 
 special administrative measures such as allowing greater communication for 
 inmates with the outside world. 
 90. The psychologist assigned to ADX Florence, Dr Paul Zohn, outlined 
 the psychological and psychiatric care available at the prison. The 
 preference was to treat inmates with mental health problems in situ rather 
 than in hospitals where this was possible. Care was provided by one 
 psychiatrist and two psychologists who made regular rounds through the 
 housing units at ADX. Various treatment programs were available and 
 inmates who needed psychotropic medication were seen regularly by a 
 psychiatrist. Contrary to assertions previously made by the applicants, 
 video-conferencing was not ordinarily used to assess an inmate's mental 
 health. The main mental health disorders such as bipolar affective disorder, 
 depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia would not 
 preclude a designation to ADX and could be managed successfully there. 
 Conditions of confinement were largely determined by security needs and 
 would be modified based on mental illness only if the inmate's mental 
 status warranted such a change. However, if necessary, inmates could be 
 referred to one of the Bureau's Psychiatric Referral Centers for acute 
 psychiatric care. Inmates who would be considered "seriously mentally ill" 
 would not be housed at ADX but at a Referral Center. All new inmates at 
 ADX received an initial psychological evaluation and, if necessary, follow-
 up assessment and treatment planning. Thereafter, the psychological 
 department monitored any treatment needs such as medication or 
 modification to an inmate's housing, work or program assignment. 
 91. The prison chaplain at ADX, Michael S. Merrill, stated that an imam 
 was available to inmates four days a month and would speak to inmates at 
 their cell door. The chaplain had also significantly expanded the Islamic 
 section of the religious library at the prison, which included 158 Arabic 
 language books. There were also 320 videos and DVDs on Islam. The 
 Religious Services Department provided Islamic-faith programming 
 through its closed-circuit television channel, including four to five days of 
 Sunni Muslim programming on Friday and recitations of the Qur'an on 
 Friday and Saturday evenings. Inmates had access to a halal diet; special 
 EFTA00031758
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 25 
 arrangements were made for meals during Ramadan. Although there could 
 be no formal congregational prayer for any faith group, Muslim inmates 
 could perform the Azan (call to prayer) and the Salat (five daily prayers) in 
 their cells; they could also have access to prayer rugs, prayer oil, prayer 
 beads and religious headgear in their cells. 
 92. Ms Roxana Mack, the Assistant Supervisor of Education at ADX, 
 stated that H unit inmates had access to approximately 900 books with no 
 limit on the number of books an inmate could borrow. They had access to a 
 law library for two hours at a time, including access to electronic databases. 
 There were also educational courses. 
 b. The Department of Justice's letters 
 93. In the course of proceedings before the Court, the respondent 
 Government were asked to provide information as to: 
 (i) how long inmates in the Special Security Unit program had spent at 
 ADX and how long they had been in each phase of the program; 
 (ii) how many inmates were in each phase of the step down program; 
 (iii) how long each inmate had spent at ADX and how long they had 
 been in each phase of the program; and 
 (iv) how many inmates had completed the program, how long they had 
 spent at ADX and how long they had been in each phase of the program 
 94. The questions were forwarded to the United States authorities. By 
 letter dated 26 September 2011, the Department of Justice stated that there 
 were 252 inmates in ADX's General Population Unit. The Special Security 
 Unit program could house up to 32 inmates. There were 17 inmates in phase 
 I, nine in phase II and six in phase III. For the step down program, 
 32 inmates were in J Unit, 32 in K Unit and 25 in D/B Unit. The 
 Department of Justice stated that the Bureau of Prisons obligations under 
 United States law prevented disclosure of information as to the length of 
 time inmates had spent at each stage of the two programs. 
 95. By letters dated 29 September and 7 October 2011, the Section 
 Registrar clarified that the questions put by the Court were not intended to 
 obtain information on specific inmates but rather to provide meaningful 
 assistance as to: the length of time an inmate was likely to spend at ADX 
 before being admitted to either program; how long he was likely to spend in 
 each phase of either program; and how long he was likely to spend in either 
 program before transfer out of ADX. 
 96. On 24 October 2011 the Agent of the Government of the United 
 Kingdom replied, forwarding a letter of the same date from the Department 
 of Justice, which set out the results of a statistical analysis conducted by the 
 Bureau of Prisons. The analysis was based on a random sample of thirty 
 inmates selected from the General Population at ADX and/or each phase of 
 the step down program. On the basis of that sample, an inmate was likely to 
 spend three years at ADX before being admitted to the Step Down or 
 EFTA00031759
26 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 Special Security Unit programs. The likely times in each phase were: nine 
 months in intermediate, eleven months in transition and nine months in pre-
 transfer. Thus, an inmate was likely to spend three years in General 
 Population followed by two years and five months progressing through 
 either program. 
 97. The Department of Justice's letter of 26 September 2011 also 
 stressed that, while generally inmates who were subject to special 
 administrative measures were housed in the Special Security Unit, it was 
 possible for such inmates to be housed at other prisons. Furthermore, if 
 special administrative measure were vacated for an inmate at ADX, he 
 could be transferred from ADX to other prison. This had occurred for seven 
 of the thirteen inmates whose special administrative measures had been 
 vacated. 
 2. Evidence submitted by the applicants 
 98. The applicants submitted general evidence as to the effect of solitary 
 confinement on prisoners and specific evidence as to the prison regime at 
 ADX Florence. 
 99. The applicants also provided a report by a psychiatrist, Dr Terry 
 Kupers, which had been prepared specifically for the present proceedings. 
 He considered that a supermax prison regime did not amount to sensory 
 deprivation but there was an almost total lack of meaningful human 
 communication. This tended to induce a range of psychological symptoms 
 ranging from panic to psychosis and emotional breakdown. All studies into 
 the effects of supermax detention had found such symptoms after sixty 
 days' detention. Once such symptoms presented, it was not sufficient to 
 return someone to normal prison conditions in order to remedy them. 
 If supermax detention were imposed for an indeterminate period it also led 
 to chronic despair. Approximately half of suicides in United States prisons 
 involved the 6-8% of prisoners held in such conditions. The effects of 
 supermax conditions were worse for someone with pre-existing mental 
 health problems. There was also evidence of solitary confinement leading to 
 a range of physical illnesses. Dr Kuper's conclusions were supported by a 
 number of journal articles by psychologists and criminologists, which the 
 applicants provided.'

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 27 
 100. The specific evidence on ADX Florence included a series of 
 statements by Professor Laura Rovner, Director of the Civil Rights Clinic at 
 the University of Denver, which had acted for a number of prisoners at 
 ADX Florence. Professor Rovner's statements were based on her experience 
 of ADX, the evidence of her clients, and various affidavits which had been 
 prepared for litigation in the federal courts regarding ADX Florence. Her 
 latest statement, of 27 May 2011, responded to the six declarations 
 submitted by the Government. Her statement, and the other evidence 
 provided by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. 
 101. Professor Rovner recalled that one of the former wardens of ADX 
 had publicly described the prison as "a clean version of hell". Professor 
 Rovner stated that, despite the evidence set out in the six declarations, 
 conditions at ADX Florence had not changed significantly in the last two 
 years. Solitary confinement for long periods continued. One lawyer, 
 Mr Mark H. Donatelli, had conducted a survey which had found that at least 
 forty-three inmates of ADX Florence had spent eight years or more in 
 "lock -down" conditions there and at previous prisons. 
 Contact with staff could be as little as one minute per day. Some 
 prisoners were placed on "single recreation status", meaning no one else 
 was permitted to be in adjoining recreation cells at the same time. 
 Recreation privileges could be terminated for minor infractions: one 
 prisoner was denied outdoor exercise for sixty days for trying to feed 
 crumbs to birds. When he challenged this sanction through the grievance 
 process, it was increased to ninety days. Upon further appeal he was told 
 that the decision was not punitive but a managerial strategy to impress upon 
 him the importance of adhering to institutional procedures. Indoor 
 recreations were little more than cages with a single pull-up bar for exercise. 
 There was nothing to do in outdoor recreation cages save to pace up and 
 down. There was limited visibility — all that could be seen was the sky 
 through chain linking. Recreation was frequently cancelled owing to staff 
 shortages. 
 The evidence also showed that, despite the consensus in the medical 
 profession that prisoners with mental illnesses should not be held in solitary 
 confinement, ADX continued to house seriously mentally ill prisoners, 
 including those with severe schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Several 
 inmates were too sick to communicate properly with their representatives; a 
 report had been received of one prisoner who was too ill to write, but was 
 living a cell that he had covered in six inches of rubbish and faeces. Several 
 prisoners had stated in witness statements prepared for litigation in the 
 United States courts, that there were mentally ill prisoners at ADX Florence 
 who, because of their conditions, screamed all night, making sleep difficult 
 for others. General medical facilities were also inadequate: there were only 
 two doctors for 3,200 inmates at FCC Florence, and only basic healthcare 
 needs were met. There were also reports from Human Rights Watch which 
 EFTA00031761
28 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 indicated that force feeding of hunger strikers took place in an unnecessarily 
 punitive and painful way. 
 Religious services were extremely limited — one Muslim inmate had only 
 seen an imam three times — and one inmate in a general population unit had 
 received an incident report for intoning the Azan. Books and educational 
 activities were also limited. 
 For inmates, particularly those subjected to special administrative 
 measures, telephone calls, and social visits were highly restricted and 
 subject to monitoring. Contact with other inmates was generally prohibited 
 and, when they were not, communication between cells could only be 
 carried out by yelling, which was prohibited. Visits were limited to one 
 adult visitor at a time, with no physical contact, and required fourteen days' 
 written notice. Evidence in cases brought by inmates who had been 
 subjected to special administrative measures indicated that letters could be 
 limited to three sheets of paper per week and certain family members could 
 be refused clearance to write to or speak with an inmate. Special 
 administrative measures could also mean that an inmate was prohibited 
 from watching news channels on television, from receiving recent 
 newspapers or any Arabic publications whatsoever; one inmate received his 
 newspaper with whole sections removed. International telephone calls were 
 expensive and liable to disruption. 
 Despite the adoption of objective criteria for placement at ADX, it 
 remained the case that all those subjected to special administrative measures 
 or convicted of terrorism offences were liable for placement, regardless of 
 their security risk or their disciplinary record in other institutions. The 
 placement hearing was window dressing: one hearing officer had carried out 
 one hundred hearings and never found an inmate to be unsuitable for 
 placement. There was evidence of hearings taking place post facto, in some 
 cases many years after the transfer to ADX had been carried out. Inmates 
 also received only twenty-four hours' notice of a hearing and did not have 
 the right to legal representation. There was evidence that hearing officers 
 did not read all of the evidence submitted and based their decisions on 
 unreliable evidence. Inmates did not see all the evidence against them. 
 Professor Rovner also provided declarations by Arab Muslim clients, in 
 which they stated that they had never been told the reasons for their 
 placement at ADX and had been sent there after 9 September 2011, despite 
 years of good conduct in other, much less restrictive prisons, both in the 
 United States and elsewhere. 
 Although there had been an increase in the number of admissions to the 
 step down program, the fact remained that many inmates were spending 
 significant periods of time in solitary confinement prior to admission, 
 despite having met the criteria for admission for years. Four clients of the 
 Clinic had only been admitted to the program after periods of between seven 
 and thirteen years in solitary confinement and only then after commencing 
 EFTA00031762
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 29 
 litigation against the Bureau of Prisons. Another two clients had never been 
 admitted, despite their clean disciplinary records and despite periods of 
 eight to nine years at ADX. Even after the changes to procedures governing 
 entry to the program, an inmate's original crime continued to serve as the 
 basis for placement at ADX; thus it was possible for an inmate to be unable 
 to sufficiently mitigate the original reason for placement and so gain 
 admission to the program. Moreover, if an inmate had never been told the 
 reasons for his placement, he could not know what he had to do to gain 
 admission to the program. The program required three years to complete 
 and a prisoner needed one year of clear conduct in general population before 
 being eligible for step down. Even eligibility for the program did not mean 
 that a prisoner would be allowed into it. 
 Conditions in the first phase of the step down program did not differ 
 significantly from general population units. According to one inmate, 
 Mr Rezaq, lockdowns occurred frequently in J Unit, which meant inmates 
 were confined to their cells, and could last days or even weeks. Inmates 
 could also be removed from the program at any time without explanation or 
 due process, even for the most minor infractions. Some had been removed 
 from the program without receiving an incident report or were removed 
 after receiving a report for an incident for which they were soon found not 
 guilty. Yet, following such removals, they were either denied re-admission 
 to the program or forced to spend years going through it again. The Bureau 
 itself had estimated that only 5% of inmates progressed though the program 
 in the minimum three years. Even successful completion of the step down 
 program might only result in a transfer to a "communications management 
 unit", such as those housed at USP Terre Haute or USP Marion, where 
 conditions remained restrictive. 
 According to Professor Rovner, it was difficult to dispute the evidence 
 provided by the Government on special administrative measures (owing to 
 restrictions contained in the measures themselves) but, on the basis of 
 public information, she was able to state that the effect of the measures 
 could amount to solitary confinement, even if an inmate was not detained at 
 ADX. The indefinite prolongation of special administrative measures meant 
 that certain Arab-Muslim inmates had spent between five and thirteen years 
 in solitary confinement both before and after trial. Challenging such 
 measures was impossible for inmates without access to legal representation. 
 Legal aid was not available and, even if pro bono legal representation was 
 obtained, the Department of Justice could still refuse to give the lawyers the 
 necessary clearance; this had happened to her Clinic. 
 102. The applicants also relied on two letters from Human Rights 
 Watch. The first, dated 2 May 2007 to the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
 Prisons, followed a tour the organisation had been given of ADX Florence. 
 The letter expressed concerns that a number of prisoners convicted of 
 terrorism offences had been sent to the prison based on the nature of their 
 EFTA00031763
30 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 crimes and, despite good conduct since their arrival, had remained in 
 general population units and thus outside the step-down programme for up 
 to nine years. The letter made suggestions for improvement in respect of 
 recreation, mail, telephone use, the library. It also noted that progress was to 
 be made on better meeting prisoners' religious needs, such as the provision 
 of a full-time imam and commended the educational programmes available 
 through the prison's television system. In the letter Human Rights Watch 
 expressed serious concerns as to prisoners' inability to do any meaningful 
 exercise in the indoor and outdoor recreation areas, owing to the size of 
 these areas and the lack of any proper equipment. The letter urged the prison 
 authorities to investigate reports of retaliation against prisoners who were on 
 hunger strike in the form of transfer to harsher cells. The letter also said that 
 Human Rights Watch was extremely concerned about the effects of long-
 term isolation and highly limited exercise on the mental health of prisoners 
 and criticised reports of rushed consultations between prisoners and 
 psychologists, as well as the fact that evaluations were carried out via closed 
 circuit television. 
 103. The applicants obtained a second letter from Human Rights Watch, 
 dated 21 August 2008, which stated that Human Rights Watch considered 
 conditions at ADX violated the United States' treaty obligations under the 
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations 
 Convention against Torture. It was unremarkable that "minor adjustments" 
 had been made to the regime but it remained in essence one of "long-term 
 and indefinite incarceration in conditions of extreme social isolation and 
 sensory deprivation". 
 B. The Eighth Amendment and conditions of detention 
 104. The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution provides, inter alia, 
 that cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted. 
 105. The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane 
 conditions of confinement, to ensure inmates receive adequate food, 
 clothing shelter and medical care, and to take reasonable measures to 
 guarantee their safety (Fanner v. Brennan 511 US 825 (1994). Only those 
 deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities are 
 sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation 
 (Wilson v. Seiter 501 U.S. 294, 304 (1991); Rhodes v. Chapman 452 U.S. 
 337, 347 (1981)). A serious deprivation is necessary, because routine 
 discomfort is part of the penalty inmates pay for their crimes (Hudson v. 
 McMillan 503 US I (1992); Sandhi v. Conner 515 US 472 (1995)). Thus, in 
 order to establish that a deprivation violates the Eighth Amendment, a 
 prisoner must satisfy: (i) an objective test by demonstrating a sufficiently 
 serious deprivation; and (ii) a subjective test by showing that the conditions 
 EFTA00031764
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 31 
 of confinement involve the deliberate imposition of pain or deliberate 
 indifference to it (Wilson, cited above). 
 106. In Hutto v. Finney 437 US 678 (1978), the Supreme Court upheld a 
 lower court order limiting periods of punitive isolated confinement to thirty 
 days, in circumstances where the lower court had found that conditions in 
 the prison in question amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The court 
 recognised that confinement in an isolation cell was a form of punishment 
 which was subject to scrutiny under Eighth Amendment standards but 
 rejected the submission that indeterminate sentences to punitive isolation 
 always constituted cruel and unusual punishment. 
 107. Lower federal courts have found that whether an extended term of 
 solitary confinement violates the Eighth Amendment will depend on the 
 particular facts of each situation, including the circumstances, nature and 
 duration of the confinement (DeSpain v. Uphoff 264 F.3d 965 (10th Cir. 
 2001)). Although they have recognised that prolonged conditions of solitary 
 confinement may cause significant psychological damage (Davenport 
 v. DeRobertis 844 F.2d 1310, 1313 (7th Cir. 1988)), the lower COWS have, 
 for the most part, rejected Eighth Amendment claims arising either from 
 conditions of solitary confinement or from periods of confinement to cells 
 for twenty-two or twenty-three hours per day (see, inter alia, Five 
 Percenters 174 F.3d 471 
 (4th 
 Cir. 1999); In re Long Term Admin. 
 Segregation 174 F.3d 464 (4th Cir. 1999); Anderson v. County of Kern 
 45 F.3d 1310 (9th Cir. 1995); Peterkin v. Jeffes 855 F.2d. 1021 (3d cir. 
 1988); Smith v. Romer 107 F.3d 21 (10th Cir. 1997)). However, in Ruiz v. 
 Johnson 37 F. Supp 2d 855 (1999), the highest level of administrative 
 segregation in the Texan prison system was found to reach levels of 
 psychological deprivation that violated the Eighth Amendment. There, the 
 court found there had been deliberate indifference to a systemic pattern of 
 extreme social isolation and reduced environmental stimulation. The 
 objective test was found to have been met in respect of three prisoners who 
 had been in solitary confinement for between twenty-nine and thirty-five 
 years: Wilkerson v. Stalder 639 F. Supp. 2d 654 M.D.La., 2007. 
 108. Lower courts outside the Tenth Circuit (which has jurisdiction over 
 ADX Florence) have ruled that solitary confinement of prisoners with pre-
 existing serious mental illness can be sufficiently harmful to violate the 
 objective test laid down in Wilson, cited above: see Jones 'El v. Berge 164 
 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (2001) (concerning Wisconsin's "supermax" prison) and 
 Madrid v. Gomez 889 F. Supp 1146 (1995) (concerning detention at Pelican 
 Bay State Prison, California). However, the subjective test laid down in 
 Wilson may not be satisfied unless a plaintiff can show that prison officials 
 attributed any deterioration in his mental state to the conditions of his 
 confinement. Negligence in this respect does not suffice; deliberate 
 indifference is required (Scarver v. Litscher 434 F. 3d 972 (7th Cir. 2006)). 
 EFTA00031765
32 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 C. Due process of law 
 109. The Fifth Amendment protects against deprivation of life, liberty or 
 property without due process of law. In the context of prison discipline, due 
 process rights are triggered by an atypical and significant hardship on the 
 inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life (Sandin v. Conner, 
 cited above). This will include transfer to a "supermax" security prison 
 (Wilkinson v. Austin 545 US 209 (2005)). In Wilkinson, the court upheld a 
 system which gave notice of the reasons for placement in the supermax 
 prison, an opportunity to reply and multiple levels of review. Periodic 
 review of administrative segregation is also required to ensure that it is not 
 used as a pretext for indefinite confinement (Hewitt v. Helms 459 US 460 
 (1983)). 
 Sandin has been interpreted by the Tenth Circuit as requiring prisoners to 
 show that their conditions of confinement deviate substantially from the 
 baseline accepted treatment of prisoners (Estate of DiMarco v. Wyoming 
 Department of Corrections 473 F. 3d 1334 (10'h Cir. 2007)). This test was 
 found not to be satisfied by fourteen months' solitary confinement in 
 DiMarco because the prisoner in question had been provided with the 
 ordinary essentials of prison life. 
 D. Litigation challenging conditions of detention at ADX Florence 
 110. In Sattar v. Gonzales 2009 WL 606115 (D.Colo.2009) the United 
 States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed a challenge to 
 conditions of detention at ADX Florence and to the imposition of special 
 administrative measures. The plaintiff had limited contact with his family 
 and attorneys and so the court found that the "severe limitations of ADX 
 confinement" did not amount to the necessary deprivation required by the 
 objective test. 
 A constitutional challenge to the imposition of special administrative 
 measures at ADX was also dismissed by the District Court in Al-Owhali 
 v. Holder 1011 WL 288523 (D. Colo. 2011); the case is now the subject of 
 an appeal. 
 In Georgacarakos v. Wiley, 2010 WL 1291833 (D.Colo. 2010) the 
 District Court found that detention at ADX for five years did not amount to 
 atypical and significant hardship, given the availability of social visits and 
 phone calls, the opportunity to converse with other inmates in the recreation 
 areas, and the possibility of transfer out of ADX via the step down program. 
 Georgacarakos was recently followed in Matthews v. Wiley 744 F. Supp. 2d 
 1159 (D. Colo. 2010). 
 In Magluta v. United States Federal Bureau of Prisons, 29 May 2009, 
 the District Court held that the plaintiff's allegation that detention at ADX 
 had led to a significant deterioration of his mental condition failed to satisfy 
 EFTA00031766
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 33 
 the objective test in Wilson cited above. The plaintiff had not shown that 
 conditions at ADX, even if lonely or uncomfortable, failed to provide basic 
 human necessities; ADX was a prison and confinement was "intended to 
 punish inmates, not coddle them". 
 111. In Hill v. Pugh 75 Fed. Appx. 715 (10'h Cir. (2003)) United States 
 Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected an Eighth Amendment claim 
 that ADX conditions were cruel and unusual. The plaintiff was isolated in 
 his cell twenty-three hours a day for five days a week and twenty-four hours 
 the remaining two days. However, his minimal physical requirements of 
 food, shelter, clothing and warmth had been met and so the conditions 
 showed neither an "unquestioned and serious deprivation of basic human 
 needs" nor "intolerable or shocking conditions". Similar conclusions were 
 reached in Jordan v. the Federal Bureau of Prisons 191 Fed. Appx 639 (lir 
 Cir. 2006), Ajaj v. United States 293 Fed.Appx. 575 (10th Cir. 2008). 
 112. In Rezaq, et at v. Halley, et al, the plaintiffs brought Eighth 
 Amendment claims concerning their placements at ADX at various dates 
 between 1997 and 2003. The District Court granted the Bureau of Prisons' 
 motions for summary judgment: 2010 WL 5157317 (D. Colo. 2010); 2010 
 WL 5464294 (D. Colo. 2010). The court, following the recommendations of 
 the Magistrate Judge, found that the plaintiff's terrorist backgrounds and 
 convictions provided a legitimate penological interest for transferring them 
 to ADX, particularly when only thirty-five of the two hundred and six 
 inmates in federal prisons with international terrorism convictions had been 
 assigned to ADX. The plaintiffs' conditions of confinement there were not 
 so extreme as to be atypical and significant. The conditions were also 
 different from those in Wilkinson v. Austin (see paragraph 109 above) in that 
 ADX offered more opportunities for outdoor exercise, interaction with other 
 inmates and educational programmes. There was also insufficient evidence 
 of significant mental harm: there was no evidence that one of the plaintiff's 
 depression could be attributed to ADX; the remainder of the plaintiffs' 
 emotional problems were typically experienced by prisoners. Finally, owing 
 to the availability of periodical reviews and the step down program, 
 confinement at ADX was not indeterminate. The plaintiffs have appealed to 
 the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, though they have all been 
 transferred out of ADX. 
 113. In Silverstein v. Federal Bureau of Prisons 704 F Supp. 2d 1077 
 (2010), before the District Court the plaintiff alleges that he has been held in 
 solitary confinement at ADX Florence and other institutions since 1983. 
 The Bureau of Prisons has sought summary judgment in its favour in 
 respect of the plaintiff's claims. A decision is awaited; a six-day jury trial 
 was set to begin on 23 January 2012. 
 EFTA00031767
had in the Chemical Bank case. In no uncertain terms, Judge McMahon explained why she had 
 haled the prosecutor back into court: 
 I'll be very up-front with you. I want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Bank kind 
 of situation, so I would like to know about contacts between the United States 
 Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena 
 on the subject of your investigation. 
 Ex. E, p 2. 
 In Chemical Bank, a protective order precluded parties to a civil case from disclosing 
 confidential documents to others. 154 F.R.D. at 92-93. Despite this prohibition, counsel for the 
 defendant approached the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and suggested that it had 
 evidence of criminal violations relating to the case. Id. at 93. A grand jury issued a subpoena, 
 and the defendant produced to the government various confidential documents without 
 complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the protective order. Id. 
 Once this collusion came to light, the district court reprimanded the defendant for its "disregard 
 of the [protective] order[]" and admonished its behavior as "contrary to the traditions of the Bar 
 which dictate that court orders be respected." Id. 
 In addressing the government's application here, Judge McMahon specifically asked 
 whether BoiesN',1;t11t-had acted as the defendant did in Chemical Bank. The prosecutor omitted 
 any mention of his office's previous meetings with the firm, and falsely led the court to believe 
 that Boies Schiller had not encouraged its investigation. Reassured by the misrepresentations, 
 Judge McMahon commented: 
 Nothing in this record suggests to me that or Boies Schiller had anything to 
 do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
 that were the subject of the Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
 advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
 who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
 Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
 files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of

36 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 116. The 21st General Report of the European Committee for the 
 Prevention of Torture, 10 November 2011, addressed solitary confinement, 
 which it defined as whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately 
 from other prisoners or was held together with one or two other prisoners. 
 The Committee observed: 
 "[Solitary confinement] can have an extremely damaging effect on the mental, 
 somatic and social health of those concerned. This damaging effect can be immediate 
 and increases the longer the measure lasts and the more indeterminate it is. The most 
 significant indicator of the damage which solitary confinement can inflict is the 
 considerably higher rate of suicide among prisoners subjected to it than that among 
 the general prison population." 
 The report therefore urged States to minimise the use of solitary 
 confinement. It should be proportionate and, the longer it was used, the 
 stronger the reasons for it had to be. It should be lawful and subject to 
 accountability, with the fullest possible reasons given and records kept. It 
 should be necessary and non-discriminatory. It should never be imposed as 
 part of a sentence and, if imposed as a disciplinary sanction, the maximum 
 period should be fourteen days. In that period, a prisoner should have at 
 least one hour's outdoor exercise per day and other appropriate mental 
 stimulation. 
 The report also stated that the Committee's recommended procedural 
 safeguards should be rigorously followed where administrative solitary 
 confinement was used for preventative purposes, including periodical and 
 external reviews which considered, among other things, whether some of 
 the restrictions imposed were strictly necessary. In such situations, prisoners 
 should have an individual regime plan which attempted to maximise contact 
 with others. Resources should also be made available to attempt to 
 reintegrate the prisoner into the main prison community. 
 For material conditions in solitary confinement, the Committee stated 
 that the cells used should meet the same minimum standards as those 
 applicable to other prisoner accommodation. These included a cell of no less 
 than six square metres, proper cell furnishings, adequate natural and 
 artificial light, heating and ventilation, and sufficiently large exercise areas 
 to allow genuine exertion. 
 The Committee also stated that medical personnel should never 
 participate in decisions on solitary confinement and should report to the 
 prison director whenever a prisoner's health was put seriously at risk by 
 solitary confinement. 
 2. The Inter-American system 
 117. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has found that 
 isolation could in itself constitute inhuman treatment, and a more serious 
 violation could result for someone with a mental disability (Victor Rosario 
 Congo v. Ecuador, case 11.427, 13 April 1999). 
 EFTA00031770
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 37 
 In Montero Aranguren et al (Detention Center of Catia) v. Venezuela, 
 judgment of 5 July 2006, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stated: 
 "...solitary confinement cells must be used as disciplinary measures or for the 
 protection of persons only during the time necessary and in strict compliance with the 
 criteria of reasonability, necessity and legality. Such places must fulfil the minimum 
 standards for proper accommodation, sufficient space and adequate ventilation, and 
 they can only be used if a physician certifies that the prisoner is fit to sustain it. 
 (footnotes omitted)" 
 3. The United Nations 
 118. Isolation for twenty-three hours a day in a two by two metres cell 
 with ten minutes of sunlight per day was found by the United Nations 
 Human Rights Committee to violate Article 7 of the ICCPR in Polay 
 Campos v. Peru, CCPWC/61/D/577/1994, 6 November 1997. 
 119. In its recommendations to State parties, the United Nations 
 Committee against Torture has recommended that: 
 - solitary confinement be strictly and specifically regulated by law and 
 applied only in severe circumstances, with a view to its abolition 
 (Conclusions and Recommendations in respect of Luxembourg, 
 CAT/C/CR/28/2, at paragraph 6(b)); 
 - there should be adequate review mechanisms relating to the 
 determination and duration of solitary confinement (Conclusions and 
 Recommendations in respect of Denmark, CAT/C/CR/28/1 at paragraph 
 7(d)); 
 - solitary confinement for long periods of time may constitute inhuman 
 treatment (Conclusions and Recommendations in respect of Switzerland, 
 A/49/44, paragraph 133). 
 120. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Torture has found that 
 isolation for twenty-two to twenty-four hours per day may amount to ill-
 treatment and, in certain instances, torture (Interim Report of 28 July 2008, 
 A/63/I75, at paragraphs 77-85). The report included a copy of the Istanbul 
 statement on the use and effects of solitary confinement, which was adopted 
 at the International Psychological Trauma Symposium in December 2007. 
 The statement included the following on the effects of solitary confinement: 
 "It has been convincingly documented on numerous occasions that solitary 
 confinement may cause serious psychological and sometimes physiological ill effects. 
 Research suggests that between one third and as many as 90 per cent of prisoners 
 experience adverse symptoms in solitary confinement. A long list of symptoms 
 ranging from insomnia and confusion to hallucinations and psychosis has been 
 documented. Negative health effects can occur after only a few days in solitary 
 confinement, and the health risks rise with each additional day spent in such 
 conditions. 
 Individuals may react to solitary confinement differently. Still, a significant number 
 of individuals will experience serious health problems regardless of the specific 
 EFTA00031771
38 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 conditions, regardless of time and place, and regardless of pre-existing personal 
 factors. The central harmful feature of solitary confinement is that it reduces 
 meaningful social contact to a level of social and psychological stimulus that many 
 will experience as insufficient to sustain health and well being." 
 121. In his Interim Report of 5 August 2011, A/66/268, the current 
 Special Rapporteur for Torture found that where the physical conditions and 
 the prison regime of solitary confinement caused severe mental and physical 
 pain or suffering, when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, 
 indefinitely prolonged, on juveniles or persons with mental disabilities, it 
 could amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
 even torture. The report highlighted a number of general principles to help 
 to guide States to re-evaluate and minimise its use and, in certain cases, 
 abolish the practice of solitary confinement. He stated that the practice 
 should be used only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for 
 as short a time as possible. He further emphasised the need for minimum 
 procedural safeguards, internal and external, to ensure that all persons 
 deprived of their liberty were treated with humanity and respect for the 
 inherent dignity of the human person. 
 IV. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND 
 PRACTICE ON LIFE SENTENCES 
 A. The applicants' possible sentences, the federal sentencing system 
 and presidential pardons 
 I. Evidence from the United States Department of Justice 
 122. In a letter dated 26 November 2010 the United States Department 
 of Justice set out the maximum sentences each of the six applicants would 
 face if convicted. 
 123. The first applicant faces four counts of criminal conduct. The first 
 count, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, carries a 
 maximum sentence of fifteen years in prison. The second count, providing 
 material support to terrorists, carries the same maximum sentence. The third 
 count, conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage 
 property in a foreign country, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
 The sentence for the final count, money laundering, is a maximum of twenty 
 years. None of the counts contained a mandatory minimum sentence. The 
 trial judge would have the discretion to impose a sentence of no 
 imprisonment up to the maximum penalties, to run consecutively or 
 concurrently. 
 124. For the second applicant, the Department of Justice stated that the 
 maximum penalty he faced was not fifty years' imprisonment, as previously 
 EFTA00031772
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 39 
 stated, but thirty-five years' imprisonment. This was because the maximum 
 penalties for his offences were lower at the time of the alleged commission 
 of the offences than the current sentences. The correct maximum penalties 
 on each of the four counts he faced were: five years' imprisonment for the 
 count of conspiracy to provide material support and resources to terrorists; 
 ten years for providing material support and resources to terrorists; ten years 
 for conspiring to provide material support and resources to a designated 
 foreign terrorist organisation; and ten years for providing material support 
 and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. None of the 
 counts carried a mandatory minimum sentence and, as for the first applicant, 
 the trial judge would have the discretion to impose a sentence of no 
 imprisonment up to the maximum penalties, to run consecutively or 
 concurrently. 
 125. For the third applicant, as he is charged with the same offences as 
 the first applicant (save for the money laundering charge), the possible 
 sentences would be the same. 
 126. For the fourth applicant, for the Yemen hostage-taking counts, the 
 maximum sentences are life imprisonment. For the Bly, Oregon counts, the 
 maximum sentences were the same as those for the second applicant. For 
 the Afghanistan counts, the maximum sentences are fifteen years' 
 imprisonment on each count. None of the counts carried a mandatory 
 minimum sentence and the trial judge's discretion in sentencing would be 
 the same as for the first three applicants. 
 127. For the fifth applicant, the maximum sentences are: 
 conspiracy to kill United States nationals - life imprisonment; 
 conspiracy to murder — life imprisonment; 
 conspiracy to destroy buildings and property — life imprisonment; and 
 conspiracy to attack national defence utilities — ten years' imprisonment. 
 The third count, conspiracy to destroy buildings and property, has a 
 mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years' imprisonment. Therefore, if 
 convicted on all four counts, the trial judge's sentencing discretion would 
 range from twenty years' imprisonment to life. 
 128. For the sixth applicant, each of the two hundred and sixty-nine 
 counts of murder with which he is charged carries a mandatory minimum 
 sentence of life imprisonment. The remaining counts carry maximum 
 penalties of between ten years and life imprisonment. 
 129. The Department of Justice's letter also set out the applicable law on 
 federal sentencing. In addition to the need to have regard to the purposes of 
 sentencing (set out in section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code), 
 a trial judge had to consider the non-binding sentencing guidelines of the 
 United States Sentencing Commission, a judicial body. These required the 
 trial judge to have regard inter alia to any mitigating or aggravating factors, 
 the defendant's criminal history, any credit for a guilty plea, and the effect 
 of any assistance given to the United States' authorities. 
 EFTA00031773
40 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 130. The letter further confirmed that, as set out at paragraph 72 of the 
 Court's admissibility decision, there were four ways a sentence of life 
 imprisonment could be reduced. 
 First, it could be reduced by the sentencing court upon the motion of the 
 Director of the Bureau of Prisons upon a finding that "extraordinary and 
 compelling reasons warrant such a reduction". This generally involved 
 inmates with terminal illnesses. 
 Second, if a defendant provided substantial assistance in the investigation 
 of a third party, the Government could move within one year of sentencing 
 for a reduction in the sentence. 
 Third, if the defendant had been sentenced on the basis of sentencing 
 guidelines which were subsequently lowered by the Sentencing 
 Commission (the judicial body responsible for promulgating the guidelines) 
 then the sentencing court could reduce the term of imprisonment. 
 Fourth, the defendant could request commutation by the President. While 
 commutation was exercised sparingly, such relief had, on occasion, been 
 granted for serious offences involving national security. For example, in 
 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of thirteen members of the 
 FALN, a violent Puerto Rican nationalist organisation responsible for 
 bombings in the 1970s and 1980s, who had been convicted of conspiracy to 
 commit armed robbery, bomb-making, sedition and other offences. 
 131. Other reductions were available to those sentenced to less than life 
 imprisonment. Fifty-four days' credit was available each year for exemplary 
 compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations; this allowed for 
 release after 85% of the sentence had been served. Additionally, any 
 defendant had a statutory right of appeal against sentence to a federal court 
 of appeals and, though rare, to the United States Supreme Court. He could 
 also seek review of the sentencing by the trial judge within one year of the 
 sentence being passed. 
 132. The Department of Justice's letter of 22 September 2011 stated that 
 sentences were normally to run concurrently unless the law provided for 
 consecutive sentences or the trial judge positively ordered that any 
 sentences which were imposed were to run consecutively. In the applicants' 
 indictments, the only counts which carried mandatory concurrent sentences 
 were three of the counts faced by the sixth applicant (one count of using and 
 carrying an explosive, and two counts of using and carrying a dangerous 
 device during the bombing of the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es 
 Salaam). 
 The letter also underlined the Department of Justice's view that the 
 federal sentencing guidelines gave the trial judge a broad discretion in 
 sentencing. 
 EFTA00031774
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 41 
 2. Evidence submitted by the applicants 
 133. The applicants submitted a declaration from Ms Denise Barrett, the 
 National Sentencing Resource Counsel for Federal Public and Community 
 Defenders. She stated that a trial judge's discretion in sentencing was not as 
 broad as the Department of Justice had suggested. It remained subject to 
 increases as well as reductions on appeal. The sentencing guidelines 
 allowed for significant increases in sentences if the offences involved 
 terrorism, such that the recommended guideline sentence was the same as 
 the statutory maximum sentence, irrespective of the absence of any prior 
 criminal record. Owing to the possibility of consecutive sentences being 
 imposed, she therefore assessed the possible sentences as: 
 the first applicant, life plus fifty years; 
 the second applicant, thirty-five years; 
 the third applicant, life plus thirty years; 
 the fourth applicant, two life sentences plus ninety-five years; 
 the fifth applicant, three consecutive life sentences plus ten years; 
 the sixth applicant, numerous consecutive life sentences. 
 For the mechanisms for sentence reduction, Ms Barrett noted the 
 following. Compassionate release for the terminally ill or disabled was not 
 automatic and was assessed with reference to additional factors such as the 
 nature of the crime committed and the length of time served. Reduction for 
 substantial assistance to the authorities depended on the initiative of the 
 Government, not the court. Subsequent lowering of the relevant sentencing 
 guidelines could only reduce a sentence if the Sentencing Guidelines 
 Commission made the change retroactive and might not reduce the overall 
 sentence if the person concerned was convicted of other offences and given 
 consecutive sentences. For presidential commutation, the FALN pardons 
 had only been for those who had been convicted of non-violent crimes and 
 had been offered on the condition that the individuals concerned renounce 
 violence. The pardons had nonetheless been very controversial. 
 B. Eighth Amendment case-law on "grossly disproportionate" 
 sentences 
 134. The Eighth Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court 
 of the United States as prohibiting extreme sentences that are grossly 
 disproportionate to the crime (Graham v. Florida 130 S. Ct. 2011, 2021 
 (2010)). There are two categories of cases addressing proportionality of 
 sentences. 
 The first category is a case-by-case approach, where the court considers 
 all the circumstances of the case to determine whether the sentence is 
 excessive. This begins with a "threshold comparison" of the gravity of the 
 offence and the harshness of the penalty. If this leads to an inference of 
 EFTA00031775
42 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 gross disproportionality, the court compares the sentence in question with 
 sentences for the same crime in the same jurisdiction and other jurisdictions. 
 If that analysis confirms the initial inference of gross disproportionality, a 
 violation of the Eighth Amendment is established. 
 In the second category of cases, the Supreme Court has invoked 
 proportionality to adopt "categorical rules" prohibiting a particular 
 punishment from being applied to certain crimes or certain classes of 
 offenders. 
 135. Under the first category, the Supreme Court has struck down as 
 grossly disproportionate a sentence of life imprisonment without parole 
 imposed on a defendant with previous convictions for passing a worthless 
 cheque (Solem v. Helm 463 US 277 (1983)). It has upheld the following 
 sentences: life with the possibility of parole for obtaining money by false 
 pretences (Rummel v. Estelle 445 US 263 (1980)); life imprisonment 
 without parole for possessing a large quantity of cocaine (Hamelin 
 v. Michigan 501 US 957 (1991)); twenty-five years to life for theft under a 
 "three strikes" recidivist sentencing law (Ewing v. California 538 US 11 
 (2003)); forty years' imprisonment for distributing marijuana 
 (Hutto v. Davis 454 US 370 (1982)). 
 136. Examples of cases considered under the second category include 
 Coker v. Georgia 433 US 584 (1977) (prohibiting capital punishment for 
 rape) and Roper v. Simmons 543 US 551 (2005) (prohibiting capital 
 punishment for juveniles under eighteen). In Graham, cited above, the court 
 held that the Eighth Amendment also prohibited the imposition of life 
 imprisonment without parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit 
 homicide. The court found that life imprisonment without parole was an 
 especially harsh punishment for a juvenile and that the remote possibility of 
 pardon or other executive clemency did not mitigate the harshness of the 
 sentence. Although a State was not required to guarantee eventual freedom 
 to a juvenile offender convicted of a non-homicide crime, it had to provide 
 some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated 
 maturity and rehabilitation. The court also held that a sentence lacking in 
 legitimate penological justification (such as retribution, deterrence, 
 incapacitation and rehabilitation) was, by its nature, disproportionate. Such 
 purposes could justify life without parole in other contexts, but not life 
 without parole for juvenile non-homicide offenders. 
 C. Relevant international and comparative law on life sentences and 
 "grossly disproportionate" sentences 
 137. The relevant texts of the Council of Europe, the European Union 
 and other international legal texts on the imposition and review of sentences 
 of life imprisonment, including the obligations of Council of Europe 
 member States when extraditing individuals to States where they may face 
 EFTA00031776
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 43 
 such sentences, are set out in Kafkaris, cited above, at §§ 68-76. Additional 
 materials before the Court in the present cases (and those materials in 
 Kaf;cads that are expressly relied on by the parties) may be summarised as 
 follows. 
 I. Life sentences in the Contracting States 
 138. In his comparative study entitled "Outlawing Irreducible Life 
 Sentences: Europe on the Brink?", 23: I Federal Sentencing Reporter 
 Vol 23, No 1 (October 2010), Professor Van Zyl Smit concluded that the 
 majority of European countries do not have irreducible life sentences, and 
 some, including Portugal, Norway and Spain, do not have life sentences at 
 all. In Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, 
 Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland 
 and Turkey, prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment have fixed periods 
 after which release is considered. In France three such prisoners have no 
 minimum period but it appears they can be considered for release after 
 30 years. In Switzerland there are provisions for indeterminate sentences for 
 dangerous offenders where release can only follow new scientific evidence 
 that the prisoner was not dangerous, although the provisions have not been 
 used. The study concludes that only the Netherlands and England and Wales 
 have irreducible life sentences. 
 2. Council of Europe texts 
 139. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and 
 Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ("CPT") prepared a report 
 on "Actual/Real Life Sentences" dated 27 June 2007 (CPT (2007) 55). The 
 report reviewed various Council of Europe texts on life sentences, including 
 recommendations (2003) 22 and 23, and stated in terms that: (a) the 
 principle of making conditional release available is relevant to all prisoners, 
 "even to life prisoners"; and (b) that all Council of Europe member States 
 had provision for compassionate release but that this "special form of 
 release" was distinct from conditional release. 
 It noted the view that discretionary release from imprisonment, as with 
 its imposition, was a matter for the courts and not the executive, a view 
 which had led to proposed changes in the procedures for reviewing life 
 imprisonment in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The report also quoted 
 with approval the CPT's report on its 2007 visit to Hungary in which it 
 stated: 
 "[A]s regards "actual lifers", the CPT has serious reservations about the very 
 concept according to which such prisoners, once they are sentenced, are considered 
 once and for all as a permanent threat to the community and are deprived of any hope 
 to be granted conditional release". 
 EFTA00031777
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
 did not foment the Government's investigation. 
 Had Judge McMahon known the truth, she likely would not have granted the government's 
 application to modify the Protective Order to allow Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena. 
 3. The government violated due process. 
 The government's conduct cannot be squared with elemental due process. U.S. CONST. 
 amend. V. Pursuant to this guarantee, "[t]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from 
 that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict." Young v. United 
 States, 481 U.S. 787, 803 (1987). The government engages in misconduct and violates due 
 process when it materially misrepresents facts before a court. See United States v. Valentine, 820 
 F.2d 565, 570 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that the government violated due process and reversing 
 conviction when the government mischaracterized the substance of grand jury testimony). 
 The prosecutor may well have known that his representations to Judge McMahon were 
 false (or at best misleading). But the Assistant U.S. Attorney's personal knowledge doesn't 
 matter. "An individual prosecutor is presumed ... to have knowledge of all information gathered 
 in connection with his office's investigation of the case." United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 
 255 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) ("The prosecutor's office is 
 an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise made by one attorney 
 must be attributed, for these purposes, to the Government."). At the barest minimum, a federal 
 prosecutor has a duty to check the entire file to ensure that his representations to a federal judge, 
 submitted on behalf of the office he serves and under oath, are true and complete. The Assistant 
 U.S. Attorney did not discharge that basic function. 
 14 
 EFTA00029834
44 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 The report's conclusion included recommendations that: no category of 
 prisoners should be "stamped" as likely to spend their natural life in prison; 
 no denial of release should ever be final; and not even recalled prisoners 
 should be deprived of hope of release. 
 3. The International Criminal Court 
 140. Article 77 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
 allows for the imposition of a term of life imprisonment when justified by 
 the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual circumstances of the 
 convicted person. Such a sentence must be reviewed after twenty-five years 
 to determine whether it should be reduced (Article 110). 
 4. The European Union 
 141. Article 5(2) of Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on 
 the European arrest warrant provides: 
 "if the offence on the basis of which the European arrest warrant has been issued is 
 punishable by custodial life sentence or life-time detention order, the execution of the 
 said arrest warrant may be subject to the condition that the issuing Member State has 
 provisions in its legal system for a review of the penalty or measure imposed, on 
 request or at the latest after 20 years, or for the application of measures of clemency to 
 which the person is entitled to apply for under the law or practice of the issuing 
 Member State, aiming at a non-execution of such penalty or measure..." 
 5. The United Kingdom 
 142. R. v. Lichniak and R. v. Pyrah [2003) 1 AC 903, the House of 
 Lords considered the compatibility of a mandatory life sentence as imposed 
 in England and Wales with Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. It found that, 
 in its operation, a mandatory life sentence was not incompatible with either 
 Article. 
 Such a sentence was partly punitive, partly preventative. The punitive 
 element was represented by the tariff term, imposed as punishment for the 
 serious crime which the convicted murderer had committed. The 
 preventative element was represented by the power to continue to detain the 
 convicted murderer in prison unless and until the Parole Board, an 
 independent body, considered it safe to release him, and also by the power 
 to recall to prison a convicted murderer who had been released if it was 
 judged necessary to recall him for the protection of the public (Lord 
 Bingham of Comhill at § 8 of the judgment). 
 The House of Lords therefore held firstly, that the appellant's complaints 
 were not of sufficient gravity to engage Article 3 of the Convention and 
 secondly, that the life sentence was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to 
 Article 5 § I of the Convention. Lord Bingham added: 
 EFTA00031778
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 45 
 "If the House had concluded that on imposition of a mandatory life sentence for 
 murder the convicted murderer forfeited his liberty to the state for the rest of his days, 
 to remain in custody until (if ever) the Home Secretary concluded that the public 
 interest would be better served by his release than by his continued detention, I would 
 have little doubt that such a sentence would be found to violate articles 3 and 5 of the 
 European Convention on Human Rights ... as being arbitrary and disproportionate." 
 143. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte 
 Hindley [2001] 1 AC 410, HL and R. v. Anderson [2003] 1 AC 837, HL, the 
 House of Lords found that, under the tariff system then in operation, there 
 was "no reason, in principle, why a crime or crimes, if sufficiently heinous 
 should not be regarded as deserving lifelong incarceration for purposes of 
 pure punishment" (per Lord Steyn at pp. 416H). Lord Steyn also observed: 
 "there is nothing logically inconsistent with the concept of a tariff by saying 
 that there are cases were the crimes are so wicked that even if the prisoner is 
 detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the requirements of 
 retribution and deterrence" (p. 4I7H). 
 144. Under the present statutory framework in England and Wales, 
 Chapter 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, a trial judge can impose a whole 
 life term or order on a defendant convicted of murder. Such a defendant is 
 not eligible for parole and can only be released by the Secretary of State. In 
 R v. Bieber [2009] 1 WLR 223 the Court of Appeal considered that such 
 whole life terms were compatible with Article 3 of the Convention. 
 It found that a whole life order did not contravene Article 3 of the 
 Convention because of the possibility of compassionate release by the 
 Secretary of State. It also found that the imposition of an irreducible life 
 sentence would not itself constitute a violation of Article 3 but rather that a 
 potential violation would only occur once the offender had been detained 
 beyond the period that could be justified on the ground of punishment and 
 deterrence. The court stated: 
 "45. While under English law the offence of murder attracts a mandatory life 
 sentence, this is not normally an irreducible sentence. The judge specifies the 
 minimum term to be served by way of punishment and deterrence before the 
 offender's release on licence can be considered. Where a whole life term is specified 
 this is because the judge considers that the offence is so serious that, for purposes of 
 punishment and deterrence, the offender must remain in prison for the rest of his days. 
 For the reasons that we have given, we do not consider that the Strasbourg court has 
 ruled that an irreducible life sentence, deliberately imposed by a judge in such 
 circumstances, will result in detention that violates article 3. Nor do we consider that 
 it will do so. 
 46. It may be that the approach of the Strasbourg court will change. There seems to 
 be a tide in Europe that is setting against the imposition of very lengthy terms of 
 imprisonment that are irreducible. Thus it may become necessary to consider whether 
 whole life terms imposed in this jurisdiction are, in fact irreducible. 
 EFTA00031779
46 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 Under the regime that predated the 2003 Act it was the practice of the Secretary of 
 State to review the position of prisoners serving a whole life tariff after they had 
 served 25 years with a view to reducing the tariff in exceptional circumstances, such 
 as where the prisoner had made exceptional progress whilst in custody. No suggestion 
 was then made that the imposition of a whole life tariff infringed article 3. 
 Under the current regime the Secretary of State has a limited power to release a life 
 prisoner under section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. 
 At present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in 
 circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is 
 bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the 
 continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading 
 treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to 
 comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power 
 to release the prisoner. 
 49. For these reasons, applying the approach of the Strasbourg court in Kaficaris v 
 Cyprus 12 February 2008, we do not consider that a whole life term should be 
 considered as a sentence that is irreducible. Any article 3 challenge where a whole life 
 term has been imposed should therefore be made, not at the time of the imposition of 
 the sentence, but at the stage when the prisoner contends that, having regard to all the 
 material circumstances, including the time that he has served and the progress made in 
 prison, any further detention will constitute degrading or inhuman treatment." 
 6. Germany 
 145. Article I of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany 
 provides that human dignity shall be inviolable. Article 2(2) provides: 
 "Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity. Freedom of the 
 person shall be inviolable. These rights may be interfered with only pursuant to a 
 law." 
 The compatibility of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for 
 murder with these provisions was considered by the Federal Constitutional 
 Court in the Life Imprisonment case of 21 June 1977, 45 BVerfGE 187 (an 
 English translation of extracts of the judgment, with commentary, can be 
 found in D.P. Kommers, The Constitutional Jurisprudence of the Federal 
 Republic of Germany (2nd ed.), Duke University Press, Durham and 
 London, 1997 at pp. 306-313). 
 The court found that the State could not turn the offender into an object 
 of crime prevention to the detriment of his constitutionally protected right to 
 social worth. Respect for human dignity and the rule of law meant the 
 humane enforcement of life imprisonment was possible only when the 
 EFTA00031780
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 47 
 prisoner was given "a concrete and realistically attainable chance" to regain 
 his freedom at some later point in time. 
 The court underlined that prisons also had a duty to strive towards the re-
 socialisation of prisoners, to preserve their ability to cope with life and to 
 counteract the negative effects of incarceration and the destructive changes 
 in personality that accompanied imprisonment. It recognised, however, that, 
 for a criminal who remained a threat to society, the goal of rehabilitation 
 might never be fulfilled; in that case, it was the particular personal 
 circumstances of the criminal which might rule out successful rehabilitation 
 rather than the sentence of life imprisonment itself. The court also found 
 that, subject to these conclusions, life imprisonment for murder was not a 
 senseless or disproportionate punishment. 
 146. In the later War Criminal case 72 BVerfGE 105 (1986), where the 
 petitioner was eighty-six years of age and had served twenty years of a life 
 sentence imposed for sending fifty people to the gas chambers, the court 
 considered that the gravity of a person's crime could weigh upon whether he 
 or she could be required to serve his or her life sentence. However, a 
 judicial balancing of these factors should not place too heavy an emphasis 
 on the gravity of the crime as opposed to the personality, state of mind, and 
 age of the person. In that case, any subsequent review of the petitioner's 
 request for release would be required to weigh more heavily than before the 
 petitioner's personality, age and prison record. 
 147. In its decision of 16 January 2010, BVerfG, 2 BvR 2299/09, the 
 Federal Constitutional Court considered an extradition case where the 
 offender faced "aggravated life imprisonment until death" (erschwerte 
 lebenslangliche Freiheitsstrafe bis von Tod) in Turkey. The German 
 government had sought assurances that he would be considered for release 
 and had received the reply that the President of Turkey had the power to 
 remit sentences on grounds of chronic illness, disability, or old age. The 
 court refused to allow extradition, finding that this power of release offered 
 only a vague hope of release and was thus insufficient. Notwithstanding the 
 need to respect foreign legal orders, if someone had no practical prospect of 
 release such a sentence would be cruel and degrading (grausam and 
 erniedrigend) and would infringe the requirements of human dignity 
 provided for in Article 1. 
 7. Canada 
 148. The Supreme Court of Canada has found that a grossly 
 disproportionate sentence will amount to cruel and unusual treatment or 
 punishment (see, inter alia, R v. Smith (Edward Dewey) [1987] I SCR 
 1045). In R v. Litton [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, the court considered that, for 
 first degree murder, a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment 
 without eligibility for parole for twenty-five years was not grossly 
 disproportionate. Similarly, in R v. Latimer 2001 1 SCR 3, for second 
 EFTA00031781
48 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 degree murder, a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment 
 without eligibility for parole for ten years was not grossly disproportionate. 
 The court observed that gross disproportionality would only be found on 
 "rare and unique occasions" and that the test for determining this issue was 
 "very properly stringent and demanding". 
 8 South Africa 
 149. In Dodo v. the State (CCT 1/01) [2001] ZACC 16, the South 
 African Constitutional Court considered whether a statutory provision 
 which required a life sentence for certain offences including murder, was 
 compatible with the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, the 
 accused's constitutional right to a public trial and the constitutional 
 prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The 
 court found none of these constitutionals provisions was infringed, since the 
 statute allowed a court to pass a lesser sentence if there were substantial and 
 compelling circumstances. The court did, however, observe that the concept 
 of proportionality went to the heart of the inquiry as to whether punishment 
 was cruel, inhuman or degrading. 
 150. In Niemand v. The State (CCT 28/00) [2001] ZACC 11, the court 
 found an indeterminate sentence imposed pursuant to a declaration that the 
 defendant was a "habitual criminal" to be grossly disproportionate because 
 it could amount to life imprisonment for a non-violent offender. The court 
 "read in" a maximum sentence of fifteen years to the relevant statute. 
 9. Other jurisdictions 
 151. In Reyes v. the Queen [2002] UKPC 11 the Judicial Committee of 
 the Privy Council considered that a mandatory death penalty for murder by 
 shooting was incompatible with section 7 of the Constitution of Belize, 
 which prohibits torture and ill-treatment in identical terms to Article 3 of the 
 Convention. Lord Bingham observed that to deny the offender the 
 opportunity, before sentence is passed, to seek to persuade the court that in 
 all the circumstances to condemn him to death would be disproportionate 
 and inappropriate was to treat him as no human being should be treated. The 
 relevant law was not saved by the powers of pardon and commutation 
 vested by the Constitution in the Governor-General, assisted by an Advisory 
 Council; in Lord Bingham's words "a non-judicial body cannot not decide 
 what is the appropriate measure of punishment to be visited on a defendant 
 for the crime he has committed". 
 152. In de Boucherville v. the State of Mauritius [2008] UKPC 70 the 
 appellant had been sentenced to death. With the abolition of the death 
 penalty in Mauritius, his sentence was commuted to a mandatory life 
 sentence. The Privy Council considered the Court's judgment in Kafkaris, 
 cited above, and found that the safeguards available in Cyprus to prevent 
 EFTA00031782
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 49 
 Kaficaris from being without hope of release were not available in 
 Mauritius. The Mauritian Supreme Court had interpreted such a sentence as 
 condemning de Boucherville to penal servitude for the rest of his life and 
 the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not 
 apply. This meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and 
 arbitrary and so contrary to section 10 of the Mauritian Constitution 
 (provisions to secure protection of law, including the right to a fair trial). It 
 had also been argued by the appellant that the mandatory nature of the 
 sentence violated section 7 of the Constitution (the prohibition of torture, 
 inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment). In light of its 
 conclusion on section 10, the Committee considered it unnecessary to 
 decide that question or to consider the relevance of the possibility of release 
 under section 75 (the presidential prerogative of mercy). It did, however, 
 find that the safeguards available in Cyprus (in the form of the Attorney-
 General's powers to recommend release and the President's powers to 
 commute sentences or decree release) were not available in Mauritius. It 
 also acknowledged the appellant's argument that, as with the mandatory 
 sentence of death it had considered in Reyes, a mandatory sentence of life 
 imprisonment did not allow for consideration of the facts of the case. The 
 Privy Council also considered any differences between mandatory sentences 
 of death and life imprisonment could be exaggerated and, to this end, quoted 
 with approval the dicta of Lord Justice Laws in Wellington and Lord 
 Bingham in Lichniak (at paragraphs 65 and 142 above). 
 153. In State v. Philibert [2007] SCJ 274, the Supreme Court of 
 Mauritius held that a mandatory sentence of 45 years' imprisonment for 
 murder amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of section 
 7 on the grounds that it was disproportionate. 
 154. In State v. Tcoeib [1997] 1 LRC 90 the Namibian Supreme Court 
 considered the imposition of a discretionary life sentence to be compatible 
 with section 8 of the country's constitution (subsection (c) of which is 
 identical to Article 3 of the Convention). Chief Justice Mahomed, for the 
 unanimous court, found the relevant statutory release scheme to be 
 sufficient but observed that if release depended on the "capricious exercise" 
 of the discretion of the prison or executive authorities, the hope of release 
 would be "too faint and much too unpredictable" for the prisoner to retain 
 the dignity required by section 8. It was also observed that life 
 imprisonment could amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment if it 
 was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offence. The High Court 
 of Namibia found mandatory minimum sentences for robbery and 
 possession of firearms to be grossly disproportionate in State v. Vries 1997 
 4 LRC 1 and State v Likuwa [2000] 1 LRC 600. 
 155. In Lau Cheong and Another v. HKSAR [2002] 5 HKCFAR 415, 
 [2002] 2 HKLRD 612, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal rejected a 
 challenge to the mandatory life sentence for murder. It found that the 
 EFTA00031783
50 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 possibility of regular review of the sentence by an independent board meant 
 it was neither arbitrary nor grossly disproportionate and thus it did not 
 amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. 
 156. Section 9 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 also protects 
 against disproportionately severe treatment or punishment. 
 THE LAW 
 I. JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS 
 157. Given their similar factual and legal background, the Court decides 
 that the applications of the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants 
 should be joined pursuant to Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court. 
 Having regard, however, to the nature of the facts and the substantive 
 issues raised by the second applicant, particularly in relation to his 
 complaint concerning detention at ADX Florence, the Court considers that it 
 is not appropriate to join his application but to treat it separately. 
 II. ARTICLE 3 AND THE EXTRADITION 
 158. The applicants made two complaints in relation to their proposed 
 extradition. First, they complained that, if convicted in the United States, 
 they would be detained at ADX Florence and, furthermore, would be 
 subjected to special administrative measures (SAMS). They submitted that 
 conditions of detention at ADX Florence (whether alone or in conjunction 
 with SAMS) would violate Article 3 of the Convention. Second, the 
 applicants complained that, if convicted, they would face sentences of life 
 imprisonment without parole and/or extremely long sentences of 
 determinate length in violation of Article 3 of the Convention. 
 159. Article 3 provides: 
 "No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or 
 punishment." 
 160. The Government contested each of these arguments. 
 161. However, before turning to the merits of each of these complaints, 
 it is necessary for the Court to consider the submissions of the parties as to 
 the relevance, if any, of the extradition context to complaints made under 
 Article 3 of the Convention, as well as the parties' submissions as to the 
 appropriate forum for the applicants' prosecution. Those submissions may 
 be summarised as follows. 
 EFTA00031784
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 51 
 A. The Government 
 162. The Government relied on the reasoning of the House of Lords in 
 Wellington and the Canadian Supreme Court in Bums and Ferras (see 
 paragraphs 66-72, 74 and 75 above). On the basis of those cases, the 
 Government submitted that, in the extradition context, a distinction had to 
 be drawn between torture and other forms of ill-treatment. A real risk of 
 torture in the receiving State should be an absolute bar on extradition. 
 However, for all other forms of ill-treatment, it was legitimate to consider 
 the policy objectives pursued by extradition in determining whether the 
 ill-treatment reached the minimum level of severity required by Article 3. 
 This was the appropriate means of resolving the tension that existed 
 between the Court's judgments in Soering, on the one hand, and Chahal and 
 Saadi, on the other. Article 3 could not be interpreted as meaning that any 
 form of ill-treatment in a non-Contracting State would be sufficient to 
 prevent extradition. Such an absolutist approach to Article 3 would mean, 
 for instance, that practices such as head shaving or shackling could act as a 
 bar to extradition because the Court had found these forms of ill-treatment 
 to be in breach of Article 3 (see Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, §§ 114-
 121, ECHR 2003-XII (extracts); and Henaf v. France, no. 65436/01, §§ 45-
 89, ECHR 2003-XI). 
 163. The Government did not accept the applicants' submission that the 
 possibility of prosecution in the United Kingdom was relevant in 
 determining whether their extradition was compatible with Article 3. This 
 submission appeared to be based on the Court's judgment in Soering, where 
 the Court had found that the possibility of trial in the Federal Republic of 
 Germany was "a circumstance of relevance" in its overall assessment under 
 Article 3 (paragraph 110 of the judgment). However, the facts of Soering 
 were wholly exceptional. Both the United States and the Federal Republic 
 of Germany had jurisdiction and the Federal Republic itself had submitted 
 that extradition to the United States would breach the applicant's 
 Convention rights. In any event, there were no domestic proceedings under 
 way in the United Kingdom for any of the applicants and they could not be 
 prosecuted in the United Kingdom for the full range and gravamen of the 
 conduct alleged against them. The prosecutions were more properly brought 
 in the United States. In any event, the possibility of prosecution in the 
 United Kingdom could only be relevant if the Court were to follow the 
 relativist approach of the House of Lords in Wellington, which the 
 applicants had urged the Court not to do. 
 B. The applicants 
 164. The applicants rejected the submission that Article 3 allowed for a 
 balancing exercise of any kind. The Court had specifically rejected that 
 EFTA00031785
52 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 submission in Saadi, cited above. Even if, in extradition cases, a relativist 
 approach could be taken in respect of ill-treatment which fell short of 
 torture, this was irrelevant to their case because, in their submission, years 
 of solitary confinement at ADX amounted to torture or, at the very least, 
 was at the upper end of the scale of ill-treatment (see further below). 
 Furthermore, none of the policy reasons for taking a relativist approach to 
 ill-treatment arising from life sentences could apply to ill-treatment arising 
 from prison conditions. Detention at ADX was not mandated by United 
 States law and the United States could give an undertaking not to detain the 
 applicants there. Thus, the alternative to detention at ADX was not that they 
 would be fugitives from United States justice, but rather that they would be 
 detained in American prisons which were Article 3 compliant. 
 165. The United Kingdom was the appropriate forum for prosecution of 
 each applicant and it had jurisdiction to try them. For the first and third 
 applicants, the link with the United States was that one of the servers for the 
 website they had run had been based in Connecticut for eighteen months. 
 The case against them was based on material seized in searches of premises 
 in the United Kingdom, which the police had immediately handed to the 
 United States' authorities. The fourth applicant had been the subject of a 
 Metropolitan Police investigation but had never been charged. All the 
 evidence against him came from materials seized during that investigation. 
 The criminal conduct of the fifth and sixth applicants was alleged to have 
 taken place in their London offices. All witnesses were in the United 
 Kingdom and, as with the other applicants, all relevant evidence had been 
 obtained there. The applicants submitted that the fact that the United 
 Kingdom could prosecute them compatibly with Article 3 was a general 
 consideration in assessing the proportionality of their extradition and its 
 consequences. 
 C. The Court's assessment 
 166. The Court begins by noting the parties' submissions as to the 
 appropriate forum for prosecution. It observes, however, that the 
 Government do not intend to prosecute the applicants for any of the 
 offences for which their extradition is sought (cf. Soering, § 16, cited above, 
 where the Federal Republic of Germany had, by its extradition request to 
 the United Kingdom, indicated its intention to prosecute the applicant and, 
 in addition, its extradition request had contained proof that German courts 
 had jurisdiction to try the applicant). Consequently, the Court considers that 
 the question of the appropriate forum for prosecution, and whether this is 
 relevant to the Court's assessment under Article 3, does not therefore arise 
 for examination in the present case. 
 167. The Court further notes that the House of Lords in Wellington has 
 identified a tension between Soering and Chahal, both cited above, which 
 EFTA00031786
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 53 
 calls for clarification of the proper approach to Article 3 in extradition 
 cases. It also observes that the conclusions of the majority of the House of 
 Lords in that case depended on three distinctions which, in their judgment, 
 were to be found in this Court's case-law. The first was between extradition 
 cases and other cases of removal from the territory of a Contracting State; 
 the second was between torture and other forms of ill-treatment proscribed 
 by Article 3; and the third was between the assessment of the minimum 
 level of severity required in the domestic context and the same assessment 
 in the extra-territorial context. It is appropriate to consider each distinction 
 in turn. 
 168. For the first distinction, the Court considers that the question 
 whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in another State 
 cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The Court's own 
 case -law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between 
 extradition and other removals. For example, extradition requests may be 
 withdrawn and the Contracting State may nonetheless decide to proceed 
 with removal from its territory (see Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, § 14, 
 11 December 2008). Equally, a State may decide to remove someone who 
 faces criminal proceedings (or has already been convicted) in another State 
 in the absence of an extradition request (see, for example, Saadi v. Italy, 
 cited above, and Bader and Kanbor v. Sweden, no. 13284/04, ECHR 
 2005 -XI). Finally, there may be cases where someone has fled a State 
 because he or she fears the implementation of a particular sentence that has 
 already been passed upon him or her and is to be returned to that State, not 
 under any extradition arrangement, but as a failed asylum seeker (see D. and 
 Others v. Turkey, no. 24245/03, 22 June 2006). The Court considers that it 
 would not be appropriate for one test to be applied to each of these three 
 cases but a different test to be applied to a case in which an extradition 
 request is made and complied with. 
 169. For the second distinction, between torture and other forms of ill-
 treatment, it is true that some support for this distinction and, in turn, the 
 approach taken by the majority of the House of Lords in Wellington, can be 
 found in the Soering judgment. The Court must therefore examine whether 
 that approach has been borne out in its subsequent case-law. 
 170. It is correct that the Court has always distinguished between torture 
 on the one hand and inhuman or degrading punishment on the other (see, for 
 instance, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 167, Series A 
 no. 25; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, §§ 95-106, ECHR 1999-V). 
 However, the Court considers that this distinction is more easily drawn in 
 the domestic context where, in examining complaints made under Article 3, 
 the Court is called upon to evaluate or characterise acts which have already 
 taken place. Where, as in the extra-territorial context, a prospective 
 assessment is required, it is not always possible to determine whether the ill-
 treatment which may ensue in the receiving State will be sufficiently severe 
 EFTA00031787
4. This court possesses the inherent authority to order suppression. 
 Incident to its inherent power to superintend proceedings, this Court has the authority to 
 suppress the fruits of the government's misrepresentation. See, e.g., United States v. Cortina, 630 
 F.3d 1207, 1214 (7th Cir. 1980) ("The court has inherent authority to regulate the administration 
 of criminal justice among the parties before the bar .... [by] exclud[ing] evidence taken from 
 the defendant by willful disobedience of law." (citation omitted)); United States v. Iambus, 897 
 F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) ("It is within the court's inherent authority to suppress evidence 
 gathered unlawfully in order to maintain the integrity of its own proceedings . . . ."); Benkovitch 
 v. Gorilla, Inc., No. 2:15-cv-7806 (WJM), 2017 WL 4005452, at *2 (D.N.J. Sept. 12, 2017) 
 ("District courts have `inherent authority' to impose a variety of sanctions, including ... 
 suppression of evidence ...."). 
 It does not matter that the government made its misrepresentations to Judge McMahon 
 and not directly to this Court. "As long as a party receives an appropriate hearing, . . . the party 
 may be sanctioned for abuses of process occurring beyond the courtroom . . ." Chambers v. 
 NASCO, Inc., 510 U.S. 32, 57 (1991). "Courts have held that inherent authority sanctions may be 
 imposed for misconduct in another court where the misconduct is . . . in some way related to the 
 case before the sanctioning court." Klein v. Weidner, Civ. No. 08-3798, 2017 WL 2834260, at *6 
 (E.D. Pa. June 30, 2017) (citation and alteration omitted); Manhattan Review LLC v. Year, 16 
 Civ. 0102 (LAK) (JCF), 2017 WL 11455317, *7 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2017) ("The inherent 
 power ... can punish conduct before a different court if it is intimately related to the relevant 
 case." (citing Klein, 2017 WL 2834260, at *4)). Here, the government's misrepresentation to 
 Judge McMahon was not simply "related" to Counts Five and Six; only by the government's 
 deception was it able to obtain the factual predicate for those counts. Accordingly, the Court may 
 exercise its inherent authority to suppress that evidence. And it should. 
 15 
 EFTA00029835
54 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 as to qualify as torture. Moreover, the distinction between torture and other 
 forms of ill-treatment can be more easily drawn in cases where the risk of 
 the ill-treatment stems from factors which do not engage either directly or 
 indirectly the responsibility of the public authorities of the receiving State 
 (see, for example, D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, Reports of 
 Judgments and Decisions 1997-11I, where the Court found that the proposed 
 removal of a terminally ill man to St Kitts would be inhuman treatment and 
 thus in violation of Article 3). 
 171. For this reason, whenever the Court has found that a proposed 
 removal would be in violation of Article 3 because of a real risk of ill-
 treatment which would be intentionally inflicted in the receiving State, it has 
 normally refrained from considering whether the ill-treatment in question 
 should be characterised as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or 
 punishment. For example, in Clutha! the Court did not distinguish between 
 the various forms of ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3: at paragraph 79 of 
 its judgment the Court stated that the "Convention prohibits in absolute 
 terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". In 
 paragraph 80 the Court went on to state that: 
 "The prohibition provided by Article 3 against ill-treatment is equally absolute in 
 expulsion cases. Thus, whenever substantial grounds have been shown for believing 
 that an individual would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to 
 Article 3 if removed to another State, the responsibility of the Contracting State to 
 safeguard him or her against such treatment is engaged in the event of expulsion ..." 
 Similar passages can be found, for example, in Mcunatladov and Askarov 
 v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I and Saadi 
 v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 125, ECHR 2008-... where, in reaffirming this 
 test, no distinction was made between torture and other forms of ill-
 treatment. 
 172. The Court now turns to whether a distinction can be drawn between 
 the assessment of the minimum level of severity required in the domestic 
 context and the same assessment in the extra-territorial context. The Court 
 recalls its statement in Chahal, cited above, § 81 that it was not to be 
 inferred from paragraph 89 of Soering that there was any room for 
 balancing the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons for expulsion in 
 determining whether a State's responsibility under Article 3 was engaged. It 
 also recalls that this statement was reaffirmed in Saadi v. Italy, cited above, 
 § 138, where the Court rejected the argument advanced by the United 
 Kingdom Government that the risk of ill-treatment if a person is returned 
 should be balanced against the danger he or she posed. In Saadi the Court 
 also found that the concepts of risk and dangerousness did not lend 
 themselves to a balancing test because they were "notions that [could] only 
 be assessed independently of each other" (ibid. § 139). The Court finds that 
 the same approach must be taken to the assessment of whether the minimum 
 EFTA00031788
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 55 
 level of severity has been met for the purposes of Article 3: this too can only 
 be assessed independently of the reasons for removal or extradition. 
 173. The Court considers that its case-law since Soering confirms this 
 approach. Even in extradition cases, such as where there has been an Article 
 3 complaint concerning the risk of life imprisonment without parole, the 
 Court has focused on whether that risk was a real one, or whether it was 
 alleviated by diplomatic and prosecutorial assurances given by the 
 requesting State (see Olaechea Cahuas v. Spain, no. 24668/03, §§ 43 and 
 44, 10 August 2006; Youb Saoudi v. Spain (dec.), no. 22871/06, 
 18 September 2006; Salem v. Portugal (dec.), no. 26844/04, 9 May 2006; 
 and Nivette v. France (dec.), no. 44190/98, ECHR 2001-VII). In those 
 cases, the Court did not seek to determine whether the Article 3 threshold 
 has been met with reference to the factors set out in paragraph 89 of the 
 Soering judgment. By the same token, in cases where such assurances have 
 not been given or have been found to be inadequate, the Court has not had 
 recourse to the extradition context to determine whether there would be a 
 violation of Article 3 if the surrender were to take place (see, for example, 
 Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, §§ 66-75, 23 October 2008). Indeed in 
 the twenty-two years since the Soering judgment, in an Article 3 case the 
 Court has never undertaken an examination of the proportionality of a 
 proposed extradition or other form of removal from a Contracting State. To 
 this extent, the Court must be taken to have departed from the approach 
 contemplated by paragraphs 89 and 110 of the Soering judgment. 
 174. Finally, the Court considers that, in interpreting Article 3, limited 
 assistance can be derived from the approach taken by the Canadian Supreme 
 Court in Burns and Ferras (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above). As the 
 applicants have observed, those cases were about the provision of the 
 Canadian Charter on fundamental justice and not the Charter's prohibition 
 on cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. Furthermore, the Charter 
 system expressly provides for a balancing test in respect of both of those 
 rights, which mirrors that found in Articles 8-11 of the Convention but not 
 Article 3 (see paragraph 73 above). 
 175. Instead, the Court considers that greater interpretative assistance 
 can be derived from the approach the Human Rights Committee has taken to 
 the prohibition on torture and ill-treatment contained in Article 7 of the 
 ICCPR. The Committee's General Comment No. 20 (see paragraph 76 
 above) makes clear that Article 7 prevents refoulement both when there is a 
 real risk of torture and when there is a real risk of other forms of ill-
 treatment. Further, recent confirmation for the approach taken by the Court 
 and by the Human Rights Committee can be found in Article 19 of the 
 Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which provides that 
 no one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a 
 serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or 
 other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (see paragraph 80 
 EFTA00031789
56 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 above). The wording of Article 19 makes clear that it applies without 
 consideration of the extradition context and without distinction between 
 torture and other forms of ill-treatment. In this respect, Article 19 of the 
 Charter is fully consistent with the interpretation of Article 3 which the 
 Court has set out above. It is also consistent with the Council of Europe 
 Guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism, quoted at 
 paragraph 79 above. Finally, the Court's interpretation of Article 3, the 
 Human Rights Committee's interpretation of Article 7 of the ICCPR, and 
 the text of Article 19 of the Charter are in accordance with Articles 3 and 
 16 § 2 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, particularly when 
 the latter Article provides that the provisions of the Convention are "without 
 prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national 
 law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or 
 which relates to extradition or expulsion" (see paragraph 78 above). 
 176. The Court therefore concludes that the Chahal ruling (as reaffirmed 
 in Saadt) should be regarded as applying equally to extradition and other 
 types of removal from the territory of a Contracting State and should apply 
 without distinction between the various forms of ill-treatment which are 
 proscribed by Article 3. 
 177. However, in reaching this conclusion, the Court would underline 
 that it agrees with Lord Brown's observation in Wellington that the absolute 
 nature of Article 3 does not mean that any form of ill-treatment will act as a 
 bar to removal from a Contracting State. As Lord Brown observed, this 
 Court has repeatedly stated that the Convention does not purport to be a 
 means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention standards 
 on other States (see, as a recent authority, Al-Skeini and Others v. the United 
 Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 141, 7 July 2011). This being so, treatment 
 which might violate Article 3 because of an act or omission of a Contracting 
 State might not attain the minimum level of severity which is required for 
 there to be a violation of Article 3 in an expulsion or extradition case. For 
 example, a Contracting State's negligence in providing appropriate medical 
 care within its jurisdiction has, on occasion, led the Court to find a violation 
 of Article 3 but such violations have not been so readily established in the 
 extra -territorial context (compare the denial of prompt and appropriate 
 medical treatment for HIV/AIDS in Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, §§ 
 145-158, 22 December 2008 with N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], 
 no. 26565/05, 27 May 2008). 
 178. Equally, in the context of ill-treatment of prisoners, the following 
 factors, among others, have been decisive in the Court's conclusion that 
 there has been a violation of Article 3: 
 - the presence of premeditation (Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited 
 above, § 167); 
 EFTA00031790
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 57 
 - that the measure may have been calculated to break the applicant's 
 resistance or will (ibid, § 167; Ilafcit and Others v. Moldova and Russia 
 [GC], no. 48787/99, § 446, ECHR 2004-VH); 
 - an intention to debase or humiliate an applicant, or, if there was no such 
 intention, the fact that the measure was implemented in a manner which 
 nonetheless caused feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority (Jalloh v. 
 Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 82, ECHR 2006-IX; Peers v. Greece, no. 
 28524/95, § 75, ECHR 2001-III); 
 - the absence of any specific justification for the measure imposed (Van 
 der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, §§ 61-62, ECHR 2003-II; 
 lwaticzuk v. Poland, no. 25196/94, § 58, 15 November 2001); 
 - the arbitrary punitive nature of the measure (see Yankov, cited above, 
 § 117); 
 - the length of time for which the measure was imposed (Ireland v. the 
 United Kingdom, cited above, § 92); and 
 - the fact that there has been a degree of distress or hardship of an 
 intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention 
 (Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, §§ 197-205, ECHR 2005-IX). 
 The Court would observe that all of these elements depend closely upon 
 the facts of the case and so will not be readily established prospectively in 
 an extradition or expulsion context. 
 179. Finally, the Court reiterates that, as was observed by Lord Brown, it 
 has been very cautious in finding that removal from the territory of a 
 Contracting State would be contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. It has 
 only rarely reached such a conclusion since adopting the Chahal judgment 
 (see Saadi, cited above § 142). The Court would further add that, save for 
 cases involving the death penalty, it has even more rarely found that there 
 would be a violation of Article 3 if an applicant were to be removed to a 
 State which had a long history of respect of democracy, human rights and 
 the rule of law. 
 III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION 
 ARISING FROM CONDITIONS AT ADX FLORENCE 
 A. The admissibility of the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
 180. The Court recalls that, in its admissibility decision of 6 July 2010, it 
 declared admissible the first, second and third applicant's complaints 
 concerning detention at ADX Florence and the imposition of special 
 administrative measures post-trial. It declared inadmissible the fourth 
 applicant's similar complaint, on the grounds that his medical condition 
 meant he was unlikely to spend any more than a short period of time at 
 ADX Florence (see paragraphs 144 and 145 of the decision). 
 EFTA00031791
58 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 181. The Court finds the fifth and sixth applicant's complaints in 
 relation to ADX Florence and the imposition of special administrative 
 measures post-trial to be indistinguishable from those made by the first and 
 third applicants. Therefore, the fifth and sixth applicant's complaints are not 
 manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the 
 Convention. The Court notes that they are not inadmissible on any other 
 grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible. 
 B. Merits 
 I. The parties' submissions 
 a. The Government 
 182. The Government recalled that the applicants were suspected of 
 terrorism and the Council of Europe Guidelines on human rights and the 
 fight against terrorism had recognised that such persons could be subjected 
 to more severe restrictions than those applied to other prisoners (see 
 paragraph 114 above). The Court had also recognised that prohibitions on 
 contact and communication for security reasons did not of themselves 
 amount to inhuman treatment or punishment. The Government accepted that 
 such restrictions could not amount to complete sensory isolation and could 
 not be imposed indefinitely. However, in assessing the nature of solitary 
 confinement, factors to be taken into account included the physical 
 conditions of confinement and the possibility of visits. 
 183. On this basis, and in the light of the evidence provided by the ADX 
 officials and the Department of Justice (see paragraphs 82-96 above), the 
 applicants' complaints were unsustainable. The physical conditions of 
 detention at ADX were compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the 
 Court. Even in the highest security units at ADX, there were opportunities 
 for communication with other inmates, recreation, education, religious 
 expression and engagment with the outside world. The mental and social 
 needs of inmates were appropriately catered for and inmates could not be 
 described as being detained in conditions that amounted to sensory 
 isolation, still less indefinite solitary confinement, whether total or relative. 
 The evidence, particularly the Department of Justice's replies to the 
 Rapporteur's questions, showed that there were practical and effective 
 opportunities to enter the step down and special security unit programs, 
 which could ultimately lead to transfer to another prison. Moreover, initial 
 placement at ADX was determined by reference to stated, objective criteria, 
 with full procedural protections through the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 
 Administrative Remedy Program. 
 EFTA00031792
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 59 
 184. The Bureau of Prisons had shown itself willing and able to respond 
 to requests for change in conditions, not least the relaxation of conditions in 
 H Unit to allow phase three inmates to eat together, the expansion of Arabic 
 language books in the library, and the discontinuation of strip searches 
 before inmates could leave their cells. All of these factors meant conditions 
 at ADX Florence were distinguishable from C.B. v. Bulgaria, no. 42346/98, 
 11 March 2004 and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, ECHR 2001-1II and, in 
 fact, were much less severe than in Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], 
 no. 59450/00, ECHR 2006-IX, where the Court had found no violation of 
 Article 3. 
 185. Finally, inmates had recourse to the courts to challenge their 
 conditions of detention (see the summary of relevant Eighth Amendment 
 jurisprudence set out at paragraph 105-110 above). A detailed examination 
 of the federal courts' consideration of the challenges brought by ADX 
 inmates, showed that the allegations made in respect of ADX were 
 unfounded, and that the United States' courts applied a legal analysis which 
 was in reality no different from that applied by this Court. Moreover, these 
 decisions showed that the United States were both able and willing to 
 protect the interests of ADX inmates, assess their claims and uphold them 
 where appopriate. The Government also stated that, within the materials 
 provided by the applicants, the Court could only properly place reliance on 
 the decisions of the United States courts, rather than the untested statements 
 of inmates at ADX or reports based upon them. Among these decisions, the 
 Government placed particular emphasis on the conclusions reached by the 
 Magistrate Judge in Rezaq (summarised at paragraph 112 above). They also 
 continued to rely on the accuracy, fairness and good faith of the declarations 
 which had been provided to the Court by the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
 officials. 
 b. The applicants 
 L The first, third, fifth and sixth applicants 
 186. The above applicants invited the Court to proceed on the basis that, 
 if convicted, they would be detained at ADX Florence and subjected to 
 special administrative measures. They also adopted the submissions of the 
 third party interveners that the Eighth Amendment did not offer equivalent 
 protection to Article 3 (see paragraph 197 below). 
 187. The applicants invited the Court to consider that, throughout their 
 detention in the United Kingdom, they had never been considered 
 physically dangerous and were being held in much less stringent conditions 
 than those at ADX. For instance, the first applicant was being held in a unit 
 were he was never shackled, spent nine hours outside his cell every day and 
 participated in common activities with other prisoners, which included 
 educational classes, cooking for themselves and tending a vegetable garden. 
 EFTA00031793
60 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 He also had weekly "open" visits with his family (sitting in a large hall 
 without intervening glass screens). Even if he were to be convicted in the 
 United Kingdom and classified as a High Risk Category A prisoner (which 
 he was not) his conditions of detention would be less restricted and he 
 would enjoy access to even more educational, religious, sport and 
 recreational facilities than at present. Many of these activities would involve 
 association with large groups of prisoners. 
 188. In respect of the procedures for placement at ADX, the applicants 
 relied on the evidence they had submitted which showed that the criteria for 
 placement at ADX Florence was subjective, the transfer hearing was mere 
 window dressing, and inmates had great difficulty in challenging the 
 imposition of special administrative measures. Even on Mr Synsvoll's 
 evidence (see paragraph 89 above) the Bureau of Prisons was at the mercy 
 of the wishes of other Department of Justice agencies such as the FBI, 
 meaning that the measures could not be challenged through its 
 Administrative Remedy Program. In the applicants' submission, these faults 
 in the Bureau's procedures meant that the ADX regime did not comply with 
 the procedural requirements for solitary confinement which the Court had 
 laid down in Onoufriou v. Cyprus, no. 24407/04, § 70, 7 January 2010. 
 189. The applicants further submitted that, having regard to the Court's 
 case -law and the international materials summarised at paragraphs 114— 121 
 above, the conditions of detention at ADX amounted to solitary 
 confinement of an indefinite duration and did not comply with the 
 substantive requirements of Article 3. 
 190. All ADX Florence prisoners who were subjected to special 
 administrative measures were detained at H Unit. It was a place of almost 
 complete social isolation. Communication between inmates and with the 
 outside world was severely curtailed and at the total discretion of the 
 authorities. Contact with prison staff was minimal, as was telephone contact 
 with the outside world. Educational activities and library access were 
 limited and confined to in-cell activity. Recreation alone in an empty cage 
 was not recreation in any meaningful sense and recreation periods were 
 frequently cancelled. 
 191. The very fact of being subjected to special administrative measures 
 meant H Unit inmates were not eligible for the step down program. The 
 program itself was highly capricious. Admission was at the discretion of 
 staff and inmates could be returned to their original unit at any stage for a 
 disciplinary violation or other undefined reason without explanation or due 
 process. This might include something as minor as a disrespectful attitude to 
 staff. As Professor Rovner had observed, despite the increase in the number 
 of inmates admitted to the step down program, it remained a minority of 
 inmates who progressed through it; significant numbers of inmates spent 
 extremely long periods of time at ADX and, in the case of terrorist inmates, 
 they could spent up to thirteen years in solitary confinement before being 
 EFTA00031794
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 61 
 admitted to the program. Other inmates with good conduct records had 
 spent years but had never been admitted to the program. 
 192. The applicants also submitted that the scientific evidence on the 
 detrimental effect of solitary confinement on mental health was unequivocal 
 (see paragraph 99 above) and not disputed by the Government, yet the 
 solitary confinement regime in place at ADX failed entirely to recognise the 
 serious harm it caused to its inmates' mental health. The regime failed to 
 provide mental healthcare which was appropriate to the very serious needs 
 of the patient-inmates. Even on Dr Zohn's evidence, those with serious 
 mental health problems such as schizophrenia were detained at ADX 
 Florence. 
 193. In this connection, the first, third and fifth applicants provided the 
 following information on their mental health. 
 The first applicant had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress 
 disorder, which had worsened in the prison unit where he was detained. 
 The third applicant had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, 
 recurrent depressive disorder (with his current episode assessed as "mild" as 
 opposed to previous, severe depressive episodes), and obsessive compulsive 
 disorder in conjunction with other anxiety symptoms. The latter had 
 worsened in detention, though his depressive symptoms had improved. 
 Before his Asperger syndrome had been diagnosed in June 2009, a 
 psychiatrist had predicted a high risk of serious depression leading to 
 suicide if the third applicant were to be extradited and placed in solitary 
 confinement for a long period. The third applicant also submitted a 
 statement prepared by an American criminologist, detailing the heightened 
 difficulties experienced by those with Asperger syndrome in federal prisons 
 and the absence of proper facilities within the Bureau of Prisons to treat the 
 condition. 
 The fifth applicant had a recurrent depressive disorder and had suffered 
 several mental breakdowns while in detention in the United Kingdom. His 
 most recent psychiatrist's report assessed his current episode as moderate to 
 severe. The recommended treatment was medication with psychological 
 treatment and support, including productive activity, opportunities for 
 interaction with others and exercise. 
 ii. The fourth applicant 
 194. The fourth applicant asked the Court to reconsider its decision to 
 declare his complaint under this heading inadmissible, which it had done on 
 the grounds that, as a result of his medical conditions (see paragraph 37 
 above), there was no real risk of his spending anything more than a short 
 period of time at ADX Florence. The fourth applicant submitted a letter 
 from Professor Andrew Coyle of the International Centre for Prison Studies, 
 who had given evidence in the fourth applicant's domestic proceedings. The 
 letter, dated 1 February 2011, noted that the fourth applicant continued to be 
 EFTA00031795
62 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 detained in the United Kingdom in a non-medical facility, subject to a 
 comprehensive health and social care plan and regular daily support. 
 Professor Coyle stated that, because the United Kingdom prison authorities 
 saw no need to transfer the fourth applicant to a medical setting, the United 
 States prison authorities might have regard to this fact and conclude that he 
 could be held at ADX Florence rather than a Bureau of Prison's medical 
 facility. The fourth applicant also submitted evidence that one Arab Muslim 
 who had been convicted of terrorism offences, Omar Abdel Rahman, had 
 been detained at ADX Florence, despite severe heart problems, blindness 
 and diabetes. When his condition worsened, Abdel Rahman was transferred 
 to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, 
 Missouri and thereafter to a Federal Medical Centre at Butner, North 
 Carolina. He continued to rely on the fact that his disabilities would 
 exacerbate any ill-treatment inherent in detention at ADX Florence. 
 195. The fourth applicant submitted that, even if he were not detained at 
 ADX Florence, if he were subjected to special administrative measures, 
 detention at a Bureau of Prisons medical facility could be at least as 
 restrictive as detention at ADX and could involve the same degree of 
 solitary confinement as at ADX. Thus, even if there were no risk of 
 detention at ADX, there was still a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to 
 Article 3 at another facility. 
 196. The fourth applicant also submitted that the Eighth Amendment did 
 not offer equivalent protection to Article 3. The Supreme Court of the 
 United States had only recently (and by narrow majorities) decided that it 
 was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment on 
 minors (Roper and Graham, cited above) and it was clear that, in respect of 
 interrogation techniques used at Guantanamo Bay, the United States did not 
 adopt the same definitions of torture and other forms of ill-treatment as this 
 Court. 
 c. The third party interveners 
 197. The third party interveners (see paragraph 7 above) submitted that 
 there was a substantial gap between the protection offered by Article 3 of 
 the Convention and the protection offered by the Eighth Amendment. 
 Article 3 did not require an applicant to show deliberate imposition of pain 
 or deliberate indifference to it (Alver v. Estonia, no. 64812/01, § 55, 
 8 November 2005; Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, §§ 74-75, ECHR 
 2001 -III), whereas this was a specific requirement in order to show a 
 violation of the Eighth Amendment (the subjective test set out in Wilson: 
 see paragraph 105 above). Article 3 also provided much greater protection 
 against mental suffering and psychological harm arising from conditions of 
 detention (Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, §§ 197-205, ECHR 
 2005 -IX and Hunimatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 121, 
 29 November 2007); the United States courts did not even consider a 
 EFTA00031796
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 63 
 significant deterioration of a detainee's mental condition to be sufficient for 
 an Eighth Amendment violation unless there was also a deprivation of basic 
 physical needs such as food, shelter, clothing or warmth (see Hill and 
 Magluta, cited at paragraph 110 above). 
 198. Limited protection was provided by the due process clause of the 
 Fifth Amendment (see paragraph 109 above). Indeed, the Tenth Circuit's 
 construction of that clause provided no additional protection to the Eighth 
 Amendment. The Wilkinson case (see also paragraph 109 above) only 
 required the barest administrative review of the decision to place an inmate 
 in a supermax prison and the procedures could be informal and non-
 adversarial without any requirement for a judge or neutral arbiter. Prison 
 officials could continue to rely on the initial reasons for placement, 
 including the crime for which the inmate was in prison. The wide discretion 
 afforded to officials, the deference afforded by the courts, and the vague 
 criteria for placement at ADX (and for entry to the step down program) 
 meant there was no meaningful review at all. 
 199. There were also significant procedural obstacles to prisoners 
 seeking to vindicate their constitutional rights through the federal courts. 
 The Prison Litigation Reform Act 1996 barred prisoners from bringing 
 court claims if all administrative remedies had not been exhausted, a rule 
 which had been enforced strictly by the courts to prevent otherwise 
 compelling cases from proceeding. The Act prevented prisoners from 
 receiving compensation for mental and emotional injuries unless they also 
 showed physical injury, even in respect of official conduct which was 
 deliberately and maliciously intended to harm. The Act further allowed 
 prison officials to seek to terminate a court order in favour of a prisoner 
 after the order had been in force for two years. 
 2. The Court's assessment 
 a. General principles 
 L Article 3 and detention 
 200. As the Court has frequently stated, Article 3 of the Convention 
 enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. It 
 prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or 
 punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim's behaviour 
 (see, among other authorities, Lobito v. Italy [GC], no 26772/95, § 119, 
 ECHR 2000-IV; A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, § 99, 14 October 2010). 
 201. In order to fall under Article 3, ill-treatment must attain a minimum 
 level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level is relative; it 
 depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the 
 treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the state of 
 EFTA00031797
B. At A Minimum, This Court Should Order A Hearing At Which Maxwell 
 May Inquire Into The Circumstances Surrounding The Government's 
 Misrepresentations To Judge McMahon 
 If the Court is disinclined to grant relief on the present record, then at a minimum it 
 should hold an evidentiary hearing to probe the government's misstatements to Judge McMahon 
 and the extent to which the prosecutor's office had, in fact, coordinated with Boies Schiller prior 
 to the issuance of the grand jury subpoena. These factual issues go directly to whether the 
 predicate finding for Judge McMahon's ruling—namely, that no Chemical Bank collusion had 
 occurred —was mistaken. See, e.g., United States v. Paredes-Cordova, No. SI 03 CR. 987DAB, 
 2009 WL 1585776, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2009) ("An evidentiary hearing is normally required 
 to address motions to suppress where a factual issue is in dispute."). 
 An evidentiary hearing is warranted for an additional reason as well: If it turns out that 
 the prosecutor knew (or was reckless in not knowing) that Boies Schiller had previously 
 approached his office, both before and after the Maxwell depositions, in an effort to stir up a 
 criminal prosecution and dangled the deposition transcripts as a carrot, then suppression would 
 be warranted on that basis alone. Cf. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978); United 
 States v. Rajaratnani, 719 F.3d 139, 146 (2d Cir. 2013) ("Franks instructs a district court to hold 
 a hearing to determine whether the alleged misstatements or omissions in the warrant or wiretap 
 application were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth and, if so, whether 
 any such misstatements or omissions were material."). 
 CONCLUSION 
 For these reasons, this Court should: (1) suppress all evidence the government obtained 
 from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 
 2016 depositions and all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. 
 Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this Motion. 
 16 
 EFTA00029836
64 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 
 162, Series A no. 25, and Gafgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 88, 
 ECHR 2010-...). Although the question whether the purpose of the 
 treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into 
 account, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a 
 finding of violation of Article 3 (see Peers, cited above, § 74). 
 202. For a violation of Article 3 to arise from an applicant's conditions 
 of detention, the suffering and humiliation involved must go beyond that 
 inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form 
 of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, 
 § 56, ECHR 2009-...). Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often 
 involve an element of suffering or humiliation. However, the State must 
 ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with 
 respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution 
 of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the 
 unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the 
 practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are 
 adequately secured (see Kudla v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 92-94158, 
 ECHR-XI, and Cenbauer v. Croatia, no. 73786/01, § 44, ECHR 2006-HI; 
 A.B. v. Russia, cited above, § 100). 
 203. When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of 
 the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations 
 made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 
 2001 -II). The length of the period during which a person is detained in the 
 particular conditions also has to be considered (see, among other authorities, 
 Ciorap v. Moldova, no. 12066/02, § 64, 19 June 2007; Alver v. Estonia, no. 
 64812/01, 8 November 2005; Ostrovar v. Moldova, no. 35207/03, § 79, 
 13 September 2005). 
 204. In addition to these general principles, the following principles are 
 relevant to the present case. 
 ii. Solitary confinement 
 205. The circumstances in which the solitary confinement of prisoners 
 will violate Article 3 are now well-established in the Court's case-law. 
 206. Complete sensory isolation, coupled with total social isolation, can 
 destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which 
 cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason 
 (Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 51, ECHR 2003-II). 
 207. Other forms of solitary confinement which fall short of complete 
 sensory isolation may also violate Article 3. Solitary confinement is one of 
 the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison (A.B. v. 
 Russia, cited above, § 104) and, as the Committee for the Prevention of 
 Torture has stated, all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate 
 mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long term, to have 
 EFTA00031798
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 65 
 damaging effects, resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social 
 abilities (see lorgov v. Bulgaria, no. 40653/98, § 83, II March 2004) 
 Indeed, as the Committee's most recent report makes clear, the damaging 
 effect of solitary confinement can be immediate and increases the longer the 
 measure lasts and the more indeterminate it is (see the Committee's 21M 
 General Report, summarised at paragraph 116 above). 
 208. At the same time, however, the Court has found that the prohibition 
 of contact with other prisoners for security, disciplinary or protective 
 reasons does not in itself amount to inhuman treatment or punishment (see 
 Messina v. Italy (no. 2) (dec.), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999-V, quoted with 
 approval by the Grand Chamber in Ramirez Sanchez v. France, cited above, 
 § 12; Ocalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 191, ECHR 2005-IV). In 
 many States Parties to the Convention more stringent security measures, 
 which are intended to prevent the risk of escape, attack or disturbance of the 
 prison community, exist for dangerous prisoners (see, Ramirez Sanchez v. 
 France [GC], no. 59450/00, § 138, ECHR 2006-IX; and, as recent 
 examples, Alboreo v. France, no. 51019/08, § 110, 20 October 2011 [not 
 yet final] and Madonia v. Italy (dec.), no. 1273/06, 22 September 2009). 
 209. Thus, whilst prolonged removal from association with others is 
 undesirable, whether such a measure falls within the ambit of Article 3 of 
 the Convention depends on the particular conditions, the stringency of the 
 measure, its duration, the objective pursued and its effects on the person 
 concerned (see Rohde v. Denmark, no. 69332/01, § 93, 21 July 2005). 
 210. In applying these criteria, the Court has never laid down precise 
 rules governing the operation of solitary confinement. For example, it has 
 never specified a period of time, beyond which solitary confinement will 
 attain the minimum level of severity required for Article 3 (see Madonia, 
 cited above). The Court has, however, emphasised that solitary 
 confinement, even in cases entailing relative isolation, cannot be imposed 
 on a prisoner indefinitely (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, §§ 136 
 and 145, where the applicant was held in solitary confinement for eight 
 years and two months). 
 211. Equally, although it is not for the Court to specify which security 
 measures may be applied to prisoners, it has been particularly attentive to 
 restrictions which apply to prisoners who are not dangerous or disorderly 
 (see, for example, A.B. v. Russia, cited above, § 105 and CsiiHog v. 
 Hungary, no. 30042/08, § 36, 7 June 2011); to restrictions which cannot be 
 reasonably related to the purported objective of isolation (see Csii1158, cited 
 above, § 34,); and to restrictions which remain in place after the applicant 
 has been assessed as no longer posing a security risk (see, for example, 
 Khider v. France, no. 39364/05, §§ 118 and 119 , 9 July 2009). 
 212. Finally, in order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness resulting from a 
 decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, the decision must be 
 accompanied by procedural safeguards guaranteeing the prisoner's welfare 
 EFTA00031799
66 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 and the proportionality of the measure. First, solitary confinement measures 
 should be ordered only exceptionally and after every precaution has been 
 taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules. Second, 
 the decision imposing solitary confinement must be based on genuine 
 grounds both ab initio as well as when its duration is extended. Third, the 
 authorities' decisions should make it possible to establish that they have 
 carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the 
 prisoner's circumstances, situation and behaviour and must provide 
 substantive reasons in their support. The statement of reasons should be 
 increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by. Fourth, a system of 
 regular monitoring of the prisoner's physical and mental condition should 
 also be put in place in order to ensure that the solitary confinement 
 measures remain appropriate in the circumstances (Onoufriou, cited above, 
 § 70). Lastly, it is essential that a prisoner should be able to have an 
 independent judicial authority review the merits of and reasons for a 
 prolonged measure of solitary confinement (Ramirez Sanchez v. France, 
 cited above, § 145 above; A.B. v. Russia, cited above, § Ill). 
 iii. Recreation and outdoor exercise in prison 
 213. Of the elements relevant for the assessment of the conditions of 
 detention, special attention must be paid to the availability and duration of 
 outdoor exercise and the conditions in which prisoners may take it. The 
 Court has frequently observed that a short duration of outdoor exercise 
 limited to one hour a day was a factor that further exacerbated the situation 
 of the applicant, who was confined to his cell for the rest of the time without 
 any kind of freedom of movement (see Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 
 41833/04, § 88, 27 January 2011; Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, § 69, 21 
 December 2010, § 69, Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, § 54, 7 October 
 2010). 
 214. The physical characteristics of outdoor exercise facilities also 
 featured prominently in the Court's analysis. In Moiseyev v. Russia, the 
 exercise yards in a Moscow prison were just two square metres larger than 
 the cells and hardly afforded any real possibility for exercise. The yards 
 were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with an opening to the sky 
 protected with metal bars and a thick net. The Court considered that the 
 restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities 
 available for recreation and recuperation (see Moiseyev v. Russia, 
 no. 62936/00, § 125, 9 October 2008). The Court examined the 
 characteristics of outdoor exercise in Mandie and Jovio v. Slovenia, nos. 
 5774/10 and 5985/10, 20 October 2011. The Court found that the 
 applicants' situation (in overcrowded conditions) was further exacerbated 
 by the fact that they were confined to their cell day and night, save for two 
 hours of daily outdoor exercise, and an additional two hours per week in the 
 recreation room. As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it was hard to 
 EFTA00031800
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 67 
 see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any 
 meaningful way. It was true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, 
 listen to radio and read books in the cell. The Court found, however, that 
 this could not make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spend time 
 outside the overcrowded cell (see paragraph 78 of the judgment). 
 iv Detention and mental health 
 215. The Court has held on many occasions that the detention of a 
 person who is ill may raise issues under Article 3 of the Convention and that 
 the lack of appropriate medical care may amount to treatment contrary to 
 that provision (see Slawomir Musial v. Poland, no. 28300/06, § 87, 
 20 January 2009 with further references therein). In particular, the 
 assessment of whether the particular conditions of detention are 
 incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill 
 persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability, in 
 some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being 
 affected by any particular treatment. The feeling of inferiority and 
 powerlessness which is typical of persons who suffer from a mental disorder 
 calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has (or 
 will be) complied with. There are three particular elements to be considered 
 in relation to the compatibility of an applicant's health with his stay in 
 detention: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the 
 medical assistance and care provided in detention, and (c) the advisability of 
 maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of an 
 applicant (ibid. and Dybeku v. Albania, no. 41153/06, § 41, 18 December 
 2007). 
 b. Application of the general principles to the facts of the case 
 L The case of the fourth applicant 
 216. The Court turns first to the case of the fourth applicant, who asks 
 the Court to reconsider its decision to declare his complaint in respect of 
 ADX inadmissible. The Court will only re-examine complaints which have 
 been declared inadmissible in exceptional circumstances where a clear 
 mistake has been made either in the establishment of facts that are relevant 
 to the admissibility requirements or in the Court's assessment (Ohnez and 
 Ohnez v. Turkey (dec.), no. 39464/98, 5 July 2005). 
 217. Those circumstances do not obtain in the fourth applicant's case. 
 Indeed, as the letter from Professor Coyle recognises, the fourth applicant is 
 not detained in a medical facility but is subject to a comprehensive health 
 and social care plan and regular daily support. On the basis of the 
 information provided by the parties as to the regime at ADX, the Court does 
 not consider that it would be possible for such a plan, or such regular 
 support, to be provided at ADX. It may well be that, as the fourth applicant 
 EFTA00031801
68 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 submits, Omar Abdel Rahman was detained at ADX Florence, despite 
 severe heart problems, blindness and diabetes. However, the fourth 
 applicant's disabilities are much more severe, not least the fact that both his 
 forearms have been amputated. This fact alone would appear to make 
 detention at ADX impossible. The Court therefore refuses the fourth 
 applicant's request. 
 ii. The cases of the first, third fifth and sixth applicants. 
 218. For the above applicants, the Government have accepted that, 
 although detention at ADX would not be inevitable if they were extradited 
 and convicted in the United States, there is a real risk of detention there. The 
 Court will proceed on this basis. 
 219. In considering whether detention at ADX would violate Article 3, 
 the Court observes that it does not appear to be in dispute that physical 
 conditions at ADX Florence — that is, the size of cells, the availability of 
 lighting and appropriate sanitary facilities and so on — meet the 
 requirements of Article 3. Instead, the complaints made by the applicants 
 are principally directed first, at the alleged lack of procedural safeguards 
 before placement at ADX and second, at ADX's restrictive conditions and 
 lack of human contact. 
 220. For the first, the Court finds no basis for the applicants' submission 
 that placement at ADX would take place without any procedural safeguards. 
 The evidence submitted by the United States' authorities shows that not all 
 inmates who are convicted of international terrorism offences are housed at 
 ADX. Therefore, while it may well be the case that, as Professor Rovner 
 states, inmates convicted of terrorism offences were sent to ADX soon after 
 11 September 2001 (despite years of good conduct in other, less secure 
 federal prisons), the applicants have not shown that they would be detained 
 at ADX merely as a result of conviction for terrorism offences. Instead, it is 
 clear from the declarations submitted by the Government, particularly that 
 of Mr Milusnic, that the Federal Bureau of Prisons applies accessible and 
 rational criteria when deciding whether to transfer an inmate to ADX. 
 Placement is accompanied by a high degree of involvement of senior 
 officials within the Bureau who are external to the inmate's current 
 institution. Their involvement and the requirement that a hearing be held 
 before transfer provide an appropriate measure of procedural protection. 
 There is no evidence to suggest that such a hearing is merely window 
 dressing. Even if the transfer process were unsatisfactory, there would be 
 recourse to both the Bureau's administrative remedy programme and the 
 federal courts, by bringing a claim under the due process clause of the 
 Fourteenth Amendment, to cure any defects in the process. Despite the third 
 party interveners' submission that recourse to the courts is difficult, the fact 
 that Fourteenth Amendment cases have been brought by inmates at ADX 
 shows that such difficulties can be overcome. 
 EFTA00031802
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 69 
 221. For the second complaint, ADX's restrictive conditions, it is true 
 that the present applicants are not physically dangerous and that, as the 
 Court has observed at paragraph 211 above, it must be particularly attentive 
 to any decision to place prisoners who are not dangerous or disorderly in 
 solitary confinement. However, as the applicants' current detention in high 
 security facilities in the United Kingdom demonstrates, the United States' 
 authorities would be justified in considering the applicants, if they are 
 convicted, as posing a significant security risk and justifying strict 
 limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world. There is 
 nothing to indicate that the United States' authorities would not continually 
 review their assessment of the security risk which they considered the 
 applicants to pose. As Ms Rangel has indicated, the Federal Bureau of 
 Prisons has well-established procedures for reviewing an inmate's security 
 classification and carrying out reviews of that classification in six-monthly 
 program reviews and three-yearly progress reports. Moreover, as the 
 Department of Justice's most recent letters show, the United States' 
 authorities have proved themselves willing to revise and to lift the special 
 administrative measures which have been imposed on terrorist inmates thus 
 enabling their transfer out of ADX to other, less restrictive institutions (see 
 paragraph 97 above). 
 222. The Court also observes that it is not contested by the Government 
 that conditions at ADX Florence are highly restrictive, particularly in the 
 General Population Unit and in phase one of the Special Security Unit. 
 It is clear from the evidence submitted by both parties that the purpose of 
 the regime in those units is to prevent all physical contact between an 
 inmate and others, and to minimise social interaction between inmates and 
 staff. This does not mean, however, that inmates are kept in complete 
 sensory isolation or total social isolation. Although inmates are confined to 
 their cells for the vast majority of the time, a great deal of in-cell stimulation 
 is provided through television and radio channels, frequent newspapers, 
 books, hobby and craft items and educational programming. The range of 
 activities and services provided goes beyond what is provided in many 
 prisons in Europe. Where there are limitations on the services provided, for 
 example restrictions on group prayer, these are necessary and inevitable 
 consequences of imprisonment (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v. the 
 United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 68, ECHR 2007-V). The restrictions 
 are, for the most part, reasonably related to the purported objectives of the 
 ADX regime (cf. CsiiHog, cited above, concerning unnecessary restrictions, 
 such as a prohibition on tea-bags and books). 
 The Court also observes that the services provided by ADX are 
 supplemented by regular telephone calls and social visits and by the ability 
 of inmates, even those under special administrative measures, to correspond 
 with their families. The extent of those opportunities would be of 
 EFTA00031803
70 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 considerable assistance to the applicants who would, by their extradition, be 
 separated from their families in the United Kingdom. 
 The Court finds that there are adequate opportunities for interaction 
 between inmates. While inmates are in their cells talking to other inmates is 
 possible, admittedly only through the ventilation system. During recreation 
 periods inmates can communicate without impediment. Indeed, as 
 Mr Milusnic indicates, most inmates spend their recreation periods talking 
 (see his declaration at paragraph 85 above). 
 In addition, although it is of some concern that outdoor recreation can be 
 withdrawn for periods of three months for seemingly minor disciplinary 
 infractions, the Court places greater emphasis on the fact that, according to 
 Mr Milusnic, inmates' recreation has only been cancelled once for security 
 reasons and that the periods of recreation have been increased from five to 
 ten hours per week. 
 All of these factors mean that the isolation experienced by ADX inmates 
 is partial and relative (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 135). 
 223. The Court would also note that, as it emphasised in Ramirez 
 Sanchez, cited above, § 145, solitary confinement, even in cases entailing 
 relative isolation, cannot be imposed indefinitely. If an applicant were at 
 real risk of being detained indefinitely at ADX, then it would be possible for 
 conditions to reach the minimum level of severity required for a violation of 
 Article 3. Indeed, this may well be the case for those inmates who have 
 spent significant periods of time at ADX. However, the figures provided by 
 the United States' authorities, although disputed by the applicants, show 
 that there is a real possibility for the applicants to gain entry to the step 
 down or special security unit programs. First, the Department of Justice's 
 letter of 26 September 2011 shows that while there were 252 inmates in 
 ADX's General Population Unit, 89 inmates were in the step down 
 program. The figures provided in that letter for the special security unit 
 program, when compared with the November 2010 figures given by 
 Mr Milusnic, demonstrated that inmates are progressing through that 
 program too. Second, Ms Rangel's declarations show that inmates with 
 convictions for international terrorism have entered the step down program 
 and, in some cases, have completed it and been transferred to other 
 institutions. Ms Rangel's declaration is confirmed by the Rezaq et a! v. 
 Nalley et a/ judgment of the District Court where the petitioners, all 
 convicted international terrorists, had brought proceedings to obtain entry to 
 the step down program but, by the time the matter came to judgment, had 
 completed the program and been transferred elsewhere (see paragraph 112 
 above). 
 224. Finally, to the extent that the first, third and fifth applicants rely on 
 the fact that they have been diagnosed with various mental health problems, 
 the Court notes that those mental health conditions have not prevented their 
 being detained in high-security prisons in the United Kingdom. On the basis 
 EFTA00031804
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 71 
 of Dr Zohn's declaration, it would not appear that the psychiatric services 
 which are available at ADX would be unable to treat such conditions. The 
 Court accordingly finds that there would not be a violation of Article 3 in 
 respect of these applicants in respect of their possible detention at ADX. 
 IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 ARISING FROM THE 
 APPLICANTS' POSSIBLE SENTENCES 
 A. The admissibility of the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
 225. The first, third and fourth applicants' complaints under this head 
 were declared admissible by the Court in its decision of 6 July 2010. The 
 fifth and sixth applicants' complaints are indistinguishable from those made 
 by the first, third and fourth applicants; those complaints are not, therefore, 
 manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the 
 Convention. The Court notes that they are not inadmissible on any other 
 grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible. 
 B. Merits 
 I. The parties' submissions 
 a. The Goverment 
 226. The Government relied on the Court's rulings in Kafkaris and 
 Liger v. France, no. 19324/02, ECHR 2006-..., and the United Kingdom 
 court's rulings in Wellington and Bieber (see paragraphs 64-72 and 144 
 above). In particular, they submitted that, in Wellington, the House of Lords 
 had been correct to find that, while an irreducible life sentence might raise 
 an issue under Article 3, it would not violate Article 3 at the time of its 
 imposition unless it was grossly or clearly disproportionate. 
 227. The Government further submitted that, unless a life sentence was 
 grossly or clearly disproportionate, an irreducible life sentence would only 
 violate Article 3 if the prisoner's further imprisonment could no longer be 
 justified for the purposes of punishment and deterrence (see Wellington, 
 cited above). No court could determine at the outset of the sentence when 
 that point would be reached and, in a particular case, it might never be 
 reached at all. Therefore, in the extradition context, unless a life sentence 
 was grossly or clearly disproportionate, its compatibility with Article 3 
 could not be determined in advance of extradition. 
 228. In the present cases, none of the six applicants' sentences were 
 grossly disproportionate and all the sentences were reducible, as required by 
 EFTA00031805
72 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 Kafkaris.The Government referred to the four mechanisms for sentence 
 reduction outlined in the Department of Justice's letter of 26 November 
 2010 (see paragraph 130 above): substantial assistance to the authorities in 
 the investigation of a third party, recommendation for compassionate release 
 by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, commutation of the sentence by 
 the President or pardon, reduction of the sentence based on the the 
 sentencing guidelines which were subsequently lowered. In the 
 Government's submission, the first three mechanisms separately and all 
 four mechanisms cumulatively, were more than sufficient to establish that 
 any life sentence imposed on the applicants would be both de jure and de 
 facto reducible. 
 229. The Government observed that the first, third, fourth and fifth 
 applicants only faced the possibility of discretionary life sentences. In this 
 respect, the Court of Appeal in Bieber had correctly concluded that this 
 Court would not find a violation of Article 3 if an irreducible life sentence 
 was deliberately imposed by a judge, when that judge considered that the 
 offence was so serious that punishment and deterrence required the offender 
 to spend the rest of his days in prison (see paragraph 45 of Bieber, quoted at 
 paragraph 144 above). In the Government's view, this was especially so 
 when a discretionary life sentence by its very nature avoided the risk of 
 arbitrariness of mandatory life sentences. Accordingly, given the serious 
 nature of the allegations made against these applicants, and the full range of 
 protections available in the United States (including the Eighth 
 Amendment's protection from grossly disproportionate sentences), there 
 were no substantial grounds for believing that the imposition of 
 discretionary life sentences would violate Article 3. 
 230. For the sixth applicant, the Government submitted that, as a general 
 principle, a mandatory and irreducible life sentence would not violate 
 Article 3, especially if it were imposed on an adult offender following 
 conviction for an offence of the utmost severity. Under United States federal 
 law a mandatory life sentence was reserved for a narrow category of 
 offenders and the most serious criminal conduct. Given, therefore, that any 
 mandatory life sentence (even if, for present purposes, it were irreducible) 
 would only be imposed on the sixth applicant if he were convicted of 
 participation in an act which had caused a massive loss of life, such a 
 sentence would not be grossly disproportionate. 
 b. The applicants 
 231. The applicants submitted that a violation of Article 3 would arise, 
 not just because their sentences would in practice be irreducible, but also 
 because the sentences were grossly disproportionate. Their likely sentences 
 were, in effect, mandatory sentences which left no room for consideration of 
 their individual cases. They relied on the views expressed by the House of 
 Lords and Privy Council in Lichniak, Reyes, de Boucherville, as well as the 
 EFTA00031806
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 73 
 rulings in Dodo, Philibert, and Tcoeib (see paragraphs 142, 149 and 151-
 154 above). They also relied on academic materials detailing the inhumane 
 and degrading effects sentences of life imprisonment without parole had on 
 prisoners, particularly in the United States.' In their cases, the effects would 
 be exacerbated by the requirement that they serve the sentences at ADX 
 Florence and by the already poor mental health of some of the applicants. 
 232. It was not correct that, as the Government had suggested, no 
 Article 3 issue could arise in respect of discretionary life sentences imposed 
 by a judge. As Ms Barrett's evidence showed (see paragraph 133 above), 
 United States trial judges had a limited sentencing discretion and the 
 sentencing guidelines called for any offence involving terrorism to be 
 punished by the available statutory maximum sentence. Therefore, it was 
 highly likely that, where applicable, life sentences would be imposed. 
 Moreover, it was not necessary for a life sentence to be mandatory for it to 
 be disproportionate and thus in violation of Article 3. Several of the 
 applicants risked life sentences for non-murder offences; in those 
 circumstances, their sentences would be disproportionate because they 
 could be imposed for non-murder offences without any real judicial 
 discretion. 
 233. The applicants did not accept that the four reduction mechanisms 
 relied on by the Government meant that their sentences would be de facto 
 reducible. Proper regard had to be given to the practical realities of their 
 situation. First, they were not in a position to provide "substantial 
 assistance" to the authorities. Second, compassionate release would only 
 arise if they became terminally ill and, even then, the Bureau might not 
 exercise its discretion in favour of release. In any event, hope of release to 
 die of a terminal illness outside prison was not real hope of release. Third, 
 release as a result of a change in the sentencing guidelines was speculative, 
 did not automatically led to reductions, and would not apply if other, 
 consecutive sentences were imposed. Finally, there was no record of any 
 presidential pardon or commutation for a terrorism offence; the pardons 
 issued in respect of the FALN were not comparable. 
 234. The extradition context was relevant insofar as any applicant 
 sentenced to life imprisonment in a Contracting State could bring repeated 
 applications to the Court complaining about his or her continued 
 incarceration; by contrast, the present applicants had no means of 
 challenging their incarceration once extradited. It was not correct, therefore, 
 that an Article 3 issue could only arise after a substantial part of the 
 sentence had been served and continued detention served no purpose (cf. 
 I. Johnson and McGunigall-Smith, "Life Without Parole, America's Other Penalty: Notes 
 on Life Under Sentence of Death by Incarceration" 2008 Prison Journal 88; Appleton and 
 Grover, "The Pros and Cons of Life Without Parole" 2007 47:4 British Journal of 
 Criminology 597-615; Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch The Rest of their 
 Lives: Life without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States, 2005.

 Bieber and Wellington, cited above); an Article 3 issue could also arise at 
 the time when the sentence was imposed. Moreover, it was irrelevant at 
 what point a violation of Article 3 would arise in the United States: the 
 principled approach which the Court had always taken to Article 3 meant 
 that, whenever a risk of ill-treatment in the receiving State was clear and 
 foreseeable, there would be a violation of Article 3. 
 2. The Court's assessment 
 a. General considerations 
 235. The Court takes note of the parties' submissions as to whether the 
 applicants' likely sentences are irreducible within the meaning of that term 
 used in Kaftans. However, given the views expressed by the House of 
 Lords in Wellington and the Court of Appeal in Bieber in respect of 
 Kaftans (summarised at paragraphs 64-72 and 144 above), the Court 
 considers it necessary to consider first whether, in the context of removal to 
 another State, a grossly disproportionate sentence would violate Article 3 
 and second, at what point in the course of a life or other very long sentence 
 an Article 3 issue might arise. 
 236. For the first issue, the Court observes that all five Law Lords in 
 Wellington found that, in a sufficiently exceptional case, an extradition 
 would be in violation of Article 3 if the applicant faced a grossly 
 disproportionate sentence in the receiving State. The Government, in their 
 submissions to the Court, accepted that proposition. 
 Support for this proposition can also be found in the comparative 
 materials before the Court. Those materials demonstrate that "gross 
 disproportionality" is a widely accepted and applied test for determining 
 when a sentence will amount to inhuman or degrading punishment, or 
 equivalent constitutional norms (see the Eighth Amendment case-law 
 summarised at paragraphs 134-136 above, the judgments of the Supreme 
 Court of Canada at paragraph 148 above, and the further comparative 
 materials set out at paragraphs 151— 156 above). 
 237. Consequently, the Court is prepared to accept that while, in 
 principle, matters of appropriate sentencing largely fall outside the scope of 
 the Convention (Leger, cited above, § 72), a grossly disproportionate 
 sentence could amount to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 at the moment 
 of its imposition. However, the Court also considers that the comparative 
 materials set out above demonstrate that "gross disproportionality" is a strict 
 test and, as the Supreme Court of Canada observed in Latimer (see 
 paragraph 148 above), it will only be on "rare and unique occasions" that 
 the test will be met. 
 238. The Court also accepts that, in a removal case, a violation would 
 arise if the applicant were able to demonstrate that he or she was at a real 
 risk of receiving a grossly disproportionate sentence in the receiving State. 
 EFTA00031808
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 75 
 However, as the Court has recalled at paragraph 177 above, the Convention 
 does not purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose 
 Convention standards on other States. Due regard must be had to the fact 
 that sentencing practices vary greatly between States and that there will 
 often be legitimate and reasonable differences between States as to the 
 length of sentences which are imposed, even for similar offences. The Court 
 therefore considers that it will only be in very exceptional cases that an 
 applicant will be able to demonstrate that the sentence he or she would face 
 in a non-Contracting State would be grossly disproportionate and thus 
 contrary to Article 3. 
 239. The Court now turns to the second issue raised by the Court of 
 Appeal and House of Lords. It considers that, subject to the general 
 requirement that a sentence should not be grossly disproportionate, for life 
 sentences it is necessary to distinguish between three types of sentence: (i) a 
 life sentence with eligibility for release after a minimum period has been 
 served; (ii) a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment without the 
 possibility of parole; and (iii) a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment 
 without the possibility of parole. 
 240. The first sentence is clearly reducible and no issue can therefore 
 arise under Article 3. 
 241. For the second, a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment 
 without the possibility of parole, the Court observes that normally such 
 sentences are imposed for offences of the utmost severity, such as murder or 
 manslaughter. In any legal system, such offences, if they do not attract a life 
 sentence, will normally attract a substantial sentence of imprisonment, 
 perhaps of several decades. Therefore, any defendant who is convicted of 
 such an offence must expect to serve a significant number of years in prison 
 before he can realistically have any hope of release, irrespective of whether 
 he is given a life sentence or a determinate sentence. It follows, therefore, 
 that, if a discretionary life sentence is imposed by a court after due 
 consideration of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, an Article 3 
 issue cannot arise at the moment when it is imposed. Instead, the Court 
 agrees with the Court of Appeal in Bieber and the House of Lords in 
 Wellington that an Article 3 issue will only arise when it can be shown: 
 (i) that the applicant's continued imprisonment can no longer be justified 
 on any legitimate penological grounds (such as punishment, deterrence, 
 public protection or rehabilitation); and (ii) as the Grand Chamber stated in 
 Kaflcaris, cited above, the sentence is irreducible de facto and de lure. 
 242. For the third sentence, a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment 
 without the possibility of parole, the Court considers that greater scrutiny is 
 required. The vice of any mandatory sentence is that it deprives the 
 defendant of any possibility to put any mitigating factors or special 
 circumstances before the sentencing court (see, for instance, Reyes and de 
 Boucherville at paragraphs 151 and 152 above). This is no truer than for a 
 EFTA00031809
76 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a 
 sentence which, in effect, condemns a defendant to spend the rest of his 
 days in prison, irrespective of his level of culpability and irrespective of 
 whether the sentencing court considers the sentence to be justified. 
 However, in the Court's view, these considerations do not mean that a 
 mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is 
 per se incompatible with the Convention, although the trend in Europe is 
 clearly against such sentences (see, for example, the comparative study 
 summarised at paragraph 138 above). Instead, these considerations mean 
 that such a sentence is much more likely to be grossly disproportionate than 
 any of the other types of life sentence, especially if it requires the sentencing 
 court to disregard mitigating factors which are generally understood as 
 indicating a significantly lower level of culpability on the part of the 
 defendant, such as youth or severe mental health problems (see, for 
 instance, Hussain v. the United Kingdom and Prem Singh v. the United 
 Kingdom, judgments of 21 February 1996, Reports 1996-I at 
 paragraphs 53 and 61 respectively and the Canadian case of Bums, at 
 paragraph 93, quoted at paragraph 74 above). 
 The Court concludes therefore that, in the absence of any such gross 
 disproportionality, an Article 3 issue will arise for a mandatory sentence of 
 life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the same way as for a 
 discretionary life sentence, that is when it can be shown: (i) that the 
 applicant's continued imprisonment can no longer be justified on any 
 legitimate penological grounds; and (ii) that the sentence is irreducible de 
 facto and de lure (Kafkaris, cited above). 
 b. The present cases 
 243. The Court now turns to the facts of each case. It is convenient first 
 to consider the cases of the first, third, fourth and sixth applicants who face, 
 at most, discretionary life sentences. 
 First, the Court observes that it is by no means certain that, if extradited, 
 these applicants would be convicted of the charges against them. If they are, 
 it is also by no means certain that discretionary life sentences would be 
 imposed, particularly when none of the charges they face carries a 
 mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Nonetheless, the Court 
 considers that it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that discretionary life 
 sentences are possible. 
 Second, it is necessary to consider whether such sentences would be 
 grossly disproportionate. In this connection the Court observes that, while 
 the offences with which these applicants are charged vary, all of them 
 concern involvement in or support for terrorism. Given the seriousness of 
 terrorism offences (particularly those carried out or inspired by Al-Qaeda) 
 and the fact that the life sentences could only be imposed on these 
 applicants after the trial judge considered all relevant aggravating and 
 EFTA00031810
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 77 
 mitigating factors, the Court considers that discretionary life sentences 
 would not be grossly disproportionate in their cases. 
 Third, as the Court has observed, in respect of a discretionary life 
 sentence, an Article 3 issue will only arise when it can be shown: (i) that the 
 applicant's continued incarceration no longer serves any legitimate 
 penological purpose; and (ii) the sentence is irreducible de facto and de lure. 
 Given that none of these applicants has been convicted, still less has begun 
 serving any sentences which might be imposed upon conviction (cf. 
 Kafkaris and Leger, cited above, and lorgov v. Bulgaria (no. 2), 
 no. 36295/02, 2 September 2010), the Court considers that they have not 
 shown that, upon extradition, their incarceration in the United States would 
 not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Indeed, if they are convicted 
 and given discretionary life sentences, it may well be that, as the 
 Government have submitted, the point at which continued incarceration 
 would no longer serve any purpose may never arise. It is still less certain 
 that, if that point were ever reached, the United States' authorities would 
 refuse to avail themselves of the mechanisms which are available to reduce 
 their sentences (see paragraph 130 above and Kafkaris, cited above, § 98). 
 Accordingly, the Court finds that these applicants have not demonstrated 
 that there would be a real risk of treatment reaching the threshold of Article 
 3 as a result of their sentences if they were extradited to the United States. 
 The Court therefore finds no violation of Article 3 in their cases. 
 244. Finally, the Court turns to the case of the fifth applicant. He faces 
 two hundred and sixty-nine counts of murder and thus multiple mandatory 
 sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Court 
 does not find a mandatory life sentence would be grossly disproportionate 
 for such offences, particularly when the fifth applicant has not adduced any 
 evidence of exceptional circumstances which would indicate a significantly 
 lower level of culpability on his part. Indeed, if he is convicted of these 
 charges, it is difficult to conceive of any mitigating factors which would 
 lead a court to impose a lesser sentence than life imprisonment without the 
 possibility of parole, even if it had the discretion to do so. Moreover, for the 
 reasons it has given in respect of the first, third, fourth and sixth applicants, 
 the Court considers that he has not shown that incarceration in the United 
 States would not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Therefore, he 
 too has failed to demonstrate that there would be a real risk of treatment 
 reaching the threshold of Article 3 as a result of his sentence if he were 
 extradited to the United States. Accordingly, the Court finds that there 
 would be no violation of Article 3 in his case. 
 EFTA00031811
78 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 V. THE FIFTH AND SIXTH APPLICANTS' REMAINING 
 COMPLAINTS 
 A. The remaining complaints 
 245. In their initial application to the Court, the fifth and sixth applicants 
 made ten further complaints. 
 246. First, they alleged that the diplomatic assurances provided by the 
 United States were not sufficient to remove the risk of their being removed 
 from the federal criminal justice system and designated as enemy 
 combatants in violation of Articles 3, 5, 6 and 8 of the Convention. In 
 particular, they relied on the fact that one of their indicted co-accused, 
 Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, was detained and brought before a Military 
 Commission at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (where he was allegedly 
 tortured) only to be later transferred to stand trial in a Federal District Court 
 in New York. 
 Second, they complained that the diplomatic assurances were not 
 sufficient to remove the risk that they would be subjected to extraordinary 
 rendition. 
 Third, relying on Article 2 of the Convention the fifth applicant argued 
 that, as a result of his recurrent depressive disorder, his extradition would 
 carry an extremely high risk that he would commit suicide. 
 Fourth, the fifth and sixth applicants complained that there was a real risk 
 that they would be subjected to "special administrative measures" pre-trial 
 in violation of Articles 3, 6, 8 and 14. 
 Fifth, the applicants alleged that there would be a real risk of a flagrant 
 denial of justice in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention because the 
 extensive publicity which the United States Government's counter-terrorism 
 efforts had attracted would prejudice any jury, particularly when they were 
 to stand trial in New York. This would be exacerbated by the public 
 controversy surrounding the President's decision to transfer other high 
 profile terrorist suspects such as Khalik Sheikh Mohammed and Ahmed 
 Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, from Guantanamo to New York for trial. 
 Sixth, also under Article 6, the applicants argued that the case against 
 them had been significantly weakened as new evidence had emerged in the 
 course of their extradition proceedings. Notwithstanding this new evidence, 
 their trial would be prejudiced by the fact that any jury would hear evidence 
 linking them to a conspiracy to murder which involved Osama bin Laden 
 and Al Qaeda. 
 Seventh, the applicants argued that further prejudice would arise if CS/1, 
 Mr Al-Fadl, were to give evidence when it was not clear what pressure had 
 been put on him or inducements given to him by the prosecuting authorities 
 in order to secure his testimony. 
 EFTA00031812
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 79 
 Eighth, the sixth applicant alleged that any jury in his case would be 
 further prejudiced by the fact that he had been designated as a global 
 terrorist by the President of the United States. 
 Ninth, under Article 8 the applicants alleged that there would be a 
 disproportionate interference with their private and family life in the United 
 Kingdom if they were to be extradited. The first applicant relies on the fact 
 that his extradition would result in permanent separation from his wife, 
 children and grandchildren, who were all British residents. 
 Tenth, the applicants alleged that there would be a violation of Article 13 
 of the Convention if they were extradited as they would have no effective 
 remedy for the violations of the Convention they would suffer in the United 
 States. 
 247. In making these complaints, the fifth and sixth applicants 
 considered that it was of some relevance that, rather than extraditing them to 
 the United States in violation of the Convention, it would be possible for 
 them to be tried in the United Kingdom. The crimes of which they were 
 accused were justiciable in the United Kingdom; the vast bulk of the 
 evidence against them had been obtained by the United Kingdom authorities 
 and the majority of defence witnesses were in the United Kingdom but 
 would not travel to the United States to give evidence for fear of arrest; and, 
 despite their representations as to what would happen to the applicants in 
 the United States, the United Kingdom Government had failed to give 
 proper consideration to prosecuting them in the United Kingdom. 
 B. The Court's assessment 
 248. The Court observes that the first and second complaints, which 
 relate to an alleged risk of designation as enemy combatants and 
 extraordinary rendition, are substantially the same as those made by the 
 first, third and fourth applicants in their applications to the Court. Those 
 complaints were rejected by the Court in its admissibility decision of 6 July 
 2010: see paragraphs 104-110 and 113-116 of the decision. Having regard 
 to the similar Diplomatic Notes provided by the United States in respect of 
 the fifth and sixth applicants there is no basis to reach a different conclusion 
 in their case. Accordingly, these complaints must be rejected as manifestly 
 ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention. 
 249. In respect of the third complaint, the fifth applicant's risk of 
 suicide, the Court considers it appropriate to distinguish between the risk 
 during pre-trial and post-trial periods of detention. 
 In respect of the former, the Court notes that the first and third applicants 
 complained that the imposition of special administrative measures pre-trial 
 would have an adverse effect on their mental health. Insofar as they related 
 to their possible conditions of pre-trial detention, the Court rejected those 
 complaints as manifestly ill-founded. It found that it had not been suggested 
 EFTA00031813
80 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 that, prior to extradition, the United Kingdom authorities would not advise 
 their United States counterparts of the applicants' mental health conditions 
 or that, upon extradition, the United States' authorities would fail to provide 
 appropriate psychiatric care to them. The Court also noted that it had not 
 been argued that psychiatric care in United States federal prisons was 
 substantially different to that provided at HMP Long Lartin (where the first 
 and third applicants were being detained). There was also no reason to 
 suggest that the United States' authorities would ignore any changes in the 
 applicants' conditions or that, if they did present any suicidal tendencies or 
 symptoms of self-harm, they would refuse to alter the conditions of their 
 detention to alleviate any risk to them. 
 The Court finds that similar considerations must apply in respect of the 
 fifth applicant's complaint concerning his pre-trial detention. Accordingly, 
 insofar as it relates to the risk of suicide before his trial would take place, 
 the complaint must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded. Insofar as the 
 complaint relates to the risk of suicide in post-trial detention at ADX 
 Florence, the Court finds that no separate issue arises from the Article 3 
 complaint considered above. 
 250. The Court turns to the fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth complaints, 
 which relate, respectively, to the imposition of special administrative 
 measures pre-trial, the prejudicial effect of extensive pre-trial publicity, the 
 prejudice arising from inducements or pressure placed on Mr Al-Fadl to 
 testify against them, and the further prejudicial effect of the sixth applicant's 
 designation as a global terrorist. The Court notes that similar complaints 
 were made by the first, third and fourth applicants and rejected in the 
 admissibility decision (paragraphs 125-135, 159-160, 163 and 166). There 
 are no grounds to distinguish the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
 under these headings and, accordingly, these complaints must also be 
 rejected as manifestly ill-founded. 
 251. As regards the sixth complaint, that the evidence had significantly 
 weakened against the fifth and sixth applicants, the Court recalls that it is 
 not its task to assess the evidence against an accused, still less, in an 
 extradition case, to evaluate the strength of the requesting State's case 
 against an applicant. This complaint must also be rejected as manifestly ill-
 founded. 
 252. For the ninth complaint, that extradition would be a 
 disproportionate inference with their family and private life in the United 
 Kingdom, the Court reiterates that it will only be in exceptional 
 circumstances that an applicant's private or family life in a Contracting 
 State will outweigh the legitimate aim pursued by his or her extradition (see 
 King v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 9742/07, 26 January 2010). There 
 are no such exceptional circumstances in the fifth and sixth applicants' case, 
 particularly given the gravity of the offences with which they are charged. 
 This complaint is therefore manifestly ill founded. 
 EFTA00031814
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 81 
 253. Finally, since none of the above complaints are "arguable", no 
 issues arise under Article 13 of the Convention. The tenth complaint is 
 therefore also manifestly ill founded. 
 254. The Court's conclusion in respect of the fifth and sixth applicant's 
 ten further complaints make it unnecessary to consider what relevance, if 
 any, should be attached to their submission that they could be prosecuted in 
 the United Kingdom. 
 VI. THE SECOND APPLICANT 
 255. The Court notes that the second applicant has made similar 
 submissions under Article 3 as to the length of his likely sentence and 
 conditions at ADX Florence. For the latter, he has relied in particular on the 
 fact that his schizophrenia necessitated his transfer from high security 
 conditions at HMP Long Lartin to Broadmoor Hospital. There he has 
 significant freedom within the security of the hospital and has participated 
 in group activities as therapeutic measures. He is under the care of a 
 consultant psychiatrist, who considers it necessary to continue his 
 compulsory hospitalisation. 
 256. The Court considers that it is not in a position to rule on the merits 
 of the second applicant's complaints, particularly in respect of ADX 
 Florence, but requires further submissions from the parties. For that reason, 
 it decides to adjourn the examination of the second applicant's complaints. 
 Those complaints will now be considered under a new application number, 
 no. 17299/12. 
 VII. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT 
 257. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the 
 Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties 
 declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand 
 Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if referral of 
 the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of 
 the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the 
 Convention. 
 258. It considers that the indications made to the Government under 
 Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see above § 4) must continue in force until 
 the present judgment becomes final or until the Panel of the Grand Chamber 
 of the Court accepts any request by one or both of the parties to refer the 
 case to the Grand Chamber under Article 43 of the Convention. 
 EFTA00031815
82 BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
 FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 
 1. Joins the applications brought by the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth 
 applicants; 
 2. Adjourns its examination of the application brought by the second 
 applicant; 
 3. Declares admissible the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
 concerning detention at ADX Florence, the imposition of special 
 administrative measures post-trial, and the length of their possible 
 sentences, and the remainder of their applications inadmissible; 
 4. Holds that there would be no violation of Article 3 of the Convention as 
 a result of conditions at ADX Florence and the imposition of special 
 administrative measures post-trial if the first, third, fifth and sixth 
 applicants were extradited to the United States; 
 5. Holds that there would be no violation of Article 3 of the Convention as 
 a result of the length of their possible sentences if the first, third, fourth, 
 fifth and sixth applicants were extradited to the United States; 
 6. Decides to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the 
 Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of 
 the proceedings that the applicants should not be extradited until further 
 notice. 
 Done in English, and notified in writing on 10 April 2012, pursuant to 
 Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.

 Hello 
 I hope you are doing great. This is the statement that 
 it in? Should it be as a signed declaration? She is comfortable having it attributed to her name. 
 "I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more request that 
 Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of myself, but all of the other 
 girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and 
 the government has the responsibility to make sure that she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will 
 happen or that any of her victims will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, 
 abusing her position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would 
 fit with her long history of anti-social behavior. 
 would like to submit. What format would you like me to send 
 EFTA00031821
Drawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has lived since that time, 
 I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children and young women is evidence of 
 her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has demonstrated a complete failure to accept to 
 responsibility in any way for her actions and demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in 
 procuring victims for Epstein. She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, 
 consistent with what many of her victims have described. She has frequently lied to others, including 
 repeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle relying on Epstein 
 and others to fund her lavish existence. 
 Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and that she is willing to 
 harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She will not hesitate to leave the 
 country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially for her actions because she lacks 
 empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. She would in fact be highly motivated to flee 
 in order to reduce the possibility of continued imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously 
 complained. Her actions over the last several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that 
 being comfortable is more important to her than being connected. Even more concerning, is if she is let out she 
 has the ability to once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a 
 lifetime. I implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her 
 incarcerated until her trial."

 Will, 
 Apologies for piling on, but if you could please also make slides that have the following excerpts of the attached 
 deposition testimony, that would be a huge help as well: 
 1) 
 2 ) 
 3) 
 • The cover page of both days of testimony (so the caption and date shows) 
 • The following five excerpts (I think you should be able to just control-F to locate): 
 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls 
 for sexual massages? If you know. 
 A. I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Q. List all the people under the age of 18 that you interacted 
 with at any of Jeffrey's properties? 
 A. I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than 
 obviously who was 17 at this point. 
 Q: Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in 
 sexual activities in Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach house? 
 EFTA00031836
A: ice, not that I recall. . . . 
 Q. Do you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or 
 devices used in sexual activities? 
 A. No. 
 4) 
 Q. Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have 
 identified as having been involved in three-way sexual 
 activities, with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual 
 activities? 
 A. I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with 
 anyone when I was with him other than myself. 
 Q. I want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that 
 in the 1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein 
 was having sexual activities with anyone other than yourself 
 and the blond and brunette on those few occasions when they 
 were involved with you? 
 A. That is my testimony, that is correct. 
 5) 
 Q. Is it your testimony that you've never given anybody a 
 massage? 
 A. I have not given anyone a massages 
 Q. You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your 
 testimony? 
 A. That is my testimony. 
 Q. You never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage is your testimony? 
 A. I never gave  [Minor Victim-2]  a massagg, 
 Thank you! Very much appreciated.

Fantastic, thanks! Attached is a sample slide for a model. All the slides will be this same format—the document is an 
 excerpt from flight records. The records are attached — could you please make slides excerpting the records (and flagging 
 the date) for the following flight dates: 
 • November 11, 1996. 
 • May 9, 1997 
 • May 3, 1998 
 • August 18, 1994 
 • August 20, 1994 
 • January 3, 1995 
 • February 12, 1995 
 No need for any introductory material - I'll just drag these slides into my presentation once you prep them. Thanks a ton! 
 This is a big help.

 everyone a chance to weigh in on the substance, in particular, we wanted to circulate sooner rather than later.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00031852
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00031853
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 EFTA00031870
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 EFTA00031871
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent

 According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
 Objection to Proposed Redactions of Government's Omnibus Response & 
 Exhibit 5 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 On behalf of defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully oppose certain of the redactions 
 proposed by the government to their Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant's 
 Pre -Trial Motions ("Response"), submitted to the Court on February 26, 2021. 
 Specifically, we oppose the redactions proposed by the government contained on pages 1-128 
 and 187-88 of the Response as well as certain of the redactions in Exhibit 5. We believe 
 additional redactions are appropriate to pages 129-134 of the Response. We hereby attach our 
 proposed redactions to pages 129-134, 187-88 and Exhibit 5. 
 The Response and its Exhibits are clearly "judicial documents" presumptively subject to the 
 public access rights under both the common law and First Amendment. Lugosch v. Pyramid 
 Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006); Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49 (2d 
 Cir. 2019). Ms. Maxwell also specifically asserts her right to an open and public trial 
 pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise 
 II), 478 U.S. 1, 7 (1986). 
 Objections to Redactions Proposed on Pages 1-128 
 The government's proposed redactions on pages 1-128 all relate to materially inaccurate 
 statements made by a prosecutor for the government to Chief Judge McMahon. They also 
 relate to a sealed proceeding in which the government circumvented decades-old precedent in 
 this Circuit which held that civil litigation materials subject to a protective order cannot be 
 obtained absent notice to, and an opportunity to object by, individuals with a privacy interest 
 in those documents. Numerous civil litigants in the Second Circuit are negotiating protective 
 orders every day in reliance on Martindell and have the right to know that the protective 
 orders may be of little to no utility when their civil opponent seeks to have them used as a tool 
 EFTA00029844
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal

 SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
 Southern District of New York 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 EFTA00031879
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ 11 unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 EFTA00031880
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

 Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
 three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
 down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
 Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either

 I apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the 
 order, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it 
 doesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents — that may be because they're not referenced in any 
 will? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless 
 somebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any documents 
 on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with El and/or MI tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore 
 it if I've misread.

 for a criminal prosecution against them. 
 In circumstances such as these, "it is most important 'to have a measure of accountability and 
 for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.'" Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119 
 (quoting United States v. Amodeo (Amodeo II), 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1995)). 
 Although the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an "ongoing 
 investigation," they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the 
 same materials they obtained via their ex pane and in camera procedure are being released to 
 the public under the= unsealing process, without objection from the government. The 
 name of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and 
 Magistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot 
 alone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to 
 demonstrate that denial of public access is "essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly 
 tailored to serve that interest." United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting 
 Press -Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13-14). 
 Ms. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case 
 to determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge 
 McMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have now become 
 "judicial documents" by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers, 
 however, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those 
 materials. 
 Objections to Redactions Proposed on Pages 187-188 
 Ms. Maxwell also objects to the government's proposed redactions on pages 187-188. The 
 language at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed 
 supports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary 
 on a NY Times podcast. Yet now the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms. 
 Maxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 "stopped writing in her journal about 
 a month after that first meeting with Epstein" and the rest of her diary is "personal in nature 
 and ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein." 
 How that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could now 
 be "confidential" is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has 
 not acted as though the contents are "confidential." 
 Objections to Government's Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5 
 For similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the 
 government to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials hig ' • ched Exhibit 
 5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation o The 
 government has offered no explanation for their need to protect her "privacy" interests when 
 she has profited with her numerous podcasts, Netflix appearances and other media 
 participation, wherein she shares the same information. With the support oand

 Following up on this, I understand from that she was able to provide you with a 12 TB drive last week— could you 
 please let us know when we will be able to get the materials? I expect a judge will ask us about discovery as early as this 
 week. 
 Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that 
 was collected (including reproducing the materials that you previously gave us, but which are not searchable), or have you 
 and figured out a way to categorize the prior productions so they're useful for us? We would strongly prefer to just

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
 can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing

 Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
 visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial numbers.

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
 the following loose storage devices: 
 o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
 o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
 o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
 o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
 o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
 The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
 The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
 match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
 might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
 thanks very much,

 Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
 unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
 convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
 size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
 file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
 in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
 EFTA00031892
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will

 Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 EFTA00031893
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
 back was lacking.

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 - The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 EFTA00031898
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
 they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
 search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
 transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
 mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
 and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
 was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
 able to review them as well.)

 Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working

 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the

 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a

 more than 600,000 items.

 that the defendant intended the natural meaning of the words she used, not the allegedly truthful

I am a very close friend of Ms. and her guardian, Ms. 
 of Calderitas, Mexico. Ms. was abused by 
 Jeffrey Epstein on numerous occasions at his townhome in New 
 York and his caribbean island home in the Virgin Islands. They 
 both have expressed their interest in asking me to register her claim 
 as a victim in any case involving Mr. Epstein's estate, which she 
 believes she may have a claim. 
 She does not have legal representation yet, but is in negotiations to 
 retain and attorney soon.

Q. Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in 
 sexual activities in Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach house? 
 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form and foundation. 
 A. No, not that I recall. 
 question: 
 awyer asked the following 
 Q. Do you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or devices 
 used in sexual activities? 
 MR. PAGLIUCA: Obiection to form adation, 
 A. No. 
 The defendant now argues that these questions are ambiguous because they contain 
 "numerous undefined terms," such as "sex toy or device" and "sexual activities." (Def. Mot. 4 at 
 14). She asks, for instance, whether "bath oil" would count as a sex toy or device. (Id.). Yet this 
 argument is simply another attempt to imbue ambiguity after the fact into commonly used words 
 with common sense meanings. The mere fact that a term could apply equally to several different 
 objects does not automatically mean that the question is impermissibly vague and can never fonn 
 the basis of a perjury charge. See, e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Positivism and the Separation of Law and 
 Morals, 71 Han'. L. Rev. 593, 607 (1958) ("A legal rule forbids you to take a vehicle into the 
 public park. Plainly this forbids an automobile, but what about bicycles ... ?"). Instead, it is well-
 settled that "[t]he jury should determine whether the question—as the declarant must have 
 understood it, giving it a reasonable reading—was falsely answered." Lighte, 782 F.2d at 372. So 
 130 
 EFTA00029848
long as the question involves a phrase "which could be used with mutual understanding by a 
 questioner and answerer," it is not fundamentally ambiguous. Id. at 375 (internal quotation matks 
 omitted); see United States v. Jenkins, 727 F. App'x 732,735 (2d Cir. 2018) ("An individual of 
 ordinary intelligence would not think that a question asking for information regarding `real estate, 
 stocks, bonds, . .. or other valuable property' would allow omission of information regarding 
 money market funds ...."). 
 The use of broad or inclusive terms does not render the question fundamentally ambiguous. 
 As the Second Circuit explained in the context of the term "employment activities," "[t]tle bmad 
 language of the question is not fundamentally ambiguous; it is instead designed to capture all 
 employment activities in an applicant's recent history." United States v. Polos, 723 F. App'x 64, 
 65-66 (2d Cir. 2018). So too here. A "sex toy or device" is an intelligible phrase with an 
 understood meaning. See Sex Toy, Oxford English Dictionary Online, 
 https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/176989 (last visited February 12, 2021) ("[A] device or object 
 designed for sexual stimulation (as a dildo, vibrator, etc.) or to enhance sexual pleasure or 
 performance.").

 The defendant's objections to the next colloquy in the indictment are similarly unavailing. 
 Shortly after the above exchange, the following conversation occurred: 
 O. At any time in any of Mr. Epstein's properties, did you engagenir
 sexual  activities with any woman other than when you had three-
 !way sexual activities with Mr. Epstein? 
 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form. 
 1 3 1 
 EFTA00029849
A. Can you repeat the question? 
 Q. At any timlitry of Mr. Epstein's properties, did you engage 
 in sexual activi with any woman other than when you had three-
 way sexual activities with Mr. Epstein? 
 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection. 
 A. No. 
 Q. Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have 
 identified as having been involved in three-way sexual activities, 
 with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities? 
 A. I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone 
 when I was with him other than myself. 
 Q. I want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that in the 
 1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein was having 
 sexual activities with anyone other than yourself and the blond and 
 brunette on those few occasions when they were involved with you? 
 A. That is my testimony, that is correct. 
 The defendant primarily argues that her answers were literally true. In the defendant's 
 telling, the phrase "[w]hen I was with him," refers not to the duration of the defendant's 
 relationship with Epstein, but instead to only those moments when she was in the act of having sex 
 with Epstein and either the blond or brunette identified above. (Def. Mot. 4 at 16). 
 tt 
 thgginvalil l 
 tlenters involved a 
 beca4reeivities by defitr And in any event, 
 she further argues, because the question asked the defendant about the 1990s and 2000s, it 
 therefore covered any 'sexual activities' spanning more than a millennium." (Id. at 16-17). 
 132 
 EFTA00029850
The defendant, therefore, argues that the questioner asked whether a logically impossible 
 event occurred or will occur at some point over the course of a millennium. But the defendant's 
 professed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain 
 and obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human 
 life span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex 
 with Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly understood the question when 
 she answered it in July 2016, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the 
 questions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she now assigns to those questions: whether, 
 during the course of her relationship with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself 
 having sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to show that she was. 
 See, e.g., Indictment I 1 (stating that the defendant "assisted, facilitated, and contributed to" 
 Epstein's sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant's answers were not"literally true 
 under any conceivable interpretation of the questions." Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the 
 defendant's professed confusion now and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant 
 motion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at 1221 ("A 
 defense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving 
 it in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is 
 considered as a whole."). Accordingly, a jury should be permitted to determine what meaning the 
 defendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false. 
 Finally, the defendant answered the following questions: 
 Q. Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at 
 any of Mr. Epstein's properties? 
 A. First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a massage. 
 133 
 EFTA00029851
Q. I will ask that question if you want, but I was focusing on people 
 other than Mr. Epstein right now. 
 A. I don't give massages. 
 Q. Let's just tie that down. It is your testimony that you've never 
 given anybody a massage? 
 A. I have not given anyone a massage. 
 Q. You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your testimony? 
 A. That is my testimony. 
 Q. You never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage is your testimony? 
 A. I never gave  [Minor Victim-21a massage. 
 (Ex. 11 at 112:17-113:12). 
 The defendant argues that these questions were fundamentally ambiguous because the 
 deposition elsewhere discussed both sexual and professional massages. It was unclear, she 
 explains, what kind of massage the questioner meant. (Def. Mot. 4 at 17.) The defendant's 
 argument is, yet again, misguided. This line of questioning used broad language, and at no point 
 during this set of questions didounsel suggest that the questions were limited to sexual 
 or professional massages. Cf. Lighte, 782 F.2d at 376 (concluding that the word "you" was 
 ambiguous when the prior two questions asked about the defendant "as an individual" and then 
 switched "without indication" to the defendant "as trustee"). The defendant's answers were 
 unequivocal, with no expressions of confusion or internal contradictions. Cf Markiewicz, 978 
 F.2d at 809 (explaining that a question was ambiguous as to whether it asked about the deponent's 
 personal or professional capacities, in light of the deponent's confusion in the next questions). A 
 properly instructed jury could conclude that the defendant meant what she said: she never gave 
 anyone a massage, including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. 
 134 
 EFTA00029852
Govemment has reviewed the full report and confirmed that there is nothing exculpatory contained 
 therein. To the contrary, the report inculpates the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is not 
 entitled to its immediate disclosure. The Government will produce an unredacted version of this 
 document together with all other witness statements in advance of tria1.67
 Fourth, the defense requests production of pages from a personaldiary that is in the custody 
 of a civilian third party and is not in the custody or control of the Government. (Def. Mot. 10 at 
 10). Leaving aside the fact that the defense cites no authority for the proposition that the 
 Government has an obligation to obtain the personal papers of a third party, see United States v. 
 Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228,239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) ("The Government's `Brady obligations extend 
 only to materials within prosecutors' possession, custody or control or, in appropriate cases, that 
 of the Department of Justice, perhaps another part of the Executive Branch, or a comparable state 
 authority involved in the federal prosecution.' (quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 
 3d 736, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2018))), the Government has already represented that it has asked the third 
 party at issue about the materials the defendant purports to seek and that no such materials exist 
 In particular, to the extent the defense is concerned with whether there are diary entrie 
 the Government has already indicated in response to the defendant's second bail 
 motion that it is aware of none. (See Dkt. No. 100 at 11 n. 2 aPPeditill 
 67 As is the case with the other redacted document referenced in this motion, the redacted copy 
 defense counsel attached as Exhibit D was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for 
 one of Epstein's devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was 
 recovered from the device. 
 187 
 EFTA00029853
. In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory 
 evidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this 
 representation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be 
 denied. 
 Fifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the 
 Government to produce copies o fall subpoenas it has issued for the defendant's records as part of 
 its investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. 10 at 11). This incredibly broad request is nothing more 
 than a fishingexpedition inappropriately seekingthe details of investigative requests made through 
 the grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government 
 to provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other 
 materials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the 
 defendant's records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of 
 requests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the 
 defense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable 
 material that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In 
 the absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the 
 reasons discussed above in Sections I and IV, the defendant is not entitled to discovery or a hearing 
 relating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress 
 subpoena returns. 
 Sixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any 
 Brady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. 10 at 11-13). The motion for disclosure of Brady material 
 should be denied as moot because the Government has conducted a search for any such material 
 and has already disclosed any potentially exculpatory information in its possession of which it is

 Subject: Maxwell 
 PCU — Please join me in congratulating on the arrest this morning of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
 repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
 were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
 perseverance and creativity by in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
 than all of our paralegals. 
 will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given 
 current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in 
 bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.

 This is odd - the guy in USVI sent me a seemingly very different email yesterday. Will forward.

 I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient 
 way to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to 
 discuss anything. 
 Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
 connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
 others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
 copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
 our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
 contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request. 
 Best, 
 Parvin

 Subject: RE: 
 One of the difficulties in answering this question is that we don't have the pros memo. Here's what I've 
 been able to learn from what we do have: 
 We do have the transcripts of their grand jury testimony (although not the AUSA preamble). She is not 
 mentioned in the introductory part of the agent's testimony where the are walking through the various 
 targets and subjects of the investigation. By contrast, Epstein, and lare (pp. 5-6). 
 In fact, she only comes up once in the entire grand jury presentation, namely in the context of the 
 agent's summary of how met Epstein. Specifically, the agent testifies as follows: 
 I'm sorry, the question you asked me was: How did they meet? They met by a friend of Mr. 
 Epstein's. Jane Doe Number One was working at Mar-a-Lago and a friend of Mr. Epstein's, 
 Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 Would you like the spelling? 
 THE REPORTER: Yes, please. 
 THE WITNESS: G-H-I-S-L-A-I-N-E, Maxwell, who was a friend of Mr. Epstein, met Jane Doe 
 Number One at Mar-a-Lago and Jane Doe Number One soon after began working and providing 
 massages for Mr. Epstein 
 The fact that she has to spell it strongly suggests the name also didn't come up during whatever 
 preamble the AUSA provided. But either way, that's it. 
 As you know, she is not mentioned in the NPA and, according the lawyer at OPR who is running the NPA 
 investigation, Maxwell does not come up much, if at all, in the documents they have reviewed in 
 connection with that issue. 
 There were no federal search warrants, so there would be no applications in which target subjects would 
 be identified. There was a local search warrant, but we don't have a copy because we don't have the 
 SDFL file and we haven't asked Palm Beach county for theirs. Presumably we will get that at some point. 
 Maxwell was added to the caption of the FBI file at some point, and she does come up in some of the 
 302s (including the and interviews in a manner we're now familiar with). 
 That said, we have the FBI file, including all of their 302s, and we plan to produce those. 
 I think the proposal to get the physical file from SDFL makes sense and is manageable. We'll have to 
 work through how to do that, but OPR has at least some of that material which we could get quickly and 
 start with (including the pros memo), and once we figure out how to get the rest, 24 boxes of material is 
 a doable project.

 Thanks — yes, having an understanding of how (if at all) Maxwell fits into the Florida evidence and 
 investigation (beyond just the simple view that she wasn't the focus) would be helpful.

 other search warrant applications done as part of the SDFL investigation, but will take a look to confirm.

 Subject: RE: legal / coordination question 
 Glad you are reaching out. There has been quite a bit of news in the UK about FBI/DOJ interest in Prince 
 Andrew. Right now I have open afternoons today and tomorrow, but have events both nights. So if there is a 
 time that works between 1:30 and 5 pm GMT (8:30-noon EDT), let me know. I have some time late in my day 
 on Thursday. Friday is pretty much flat out. 
 Thanks,

 PCU - Please join me in congratulating on the arrest this morning of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
 repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
 were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
 perseverance and creativity by in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
 than all of our paralegals.

 UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
 Southern District of New York 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00029935
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00029936
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 My colleagues and I are the team of prosecutors working on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, and 
 we wondered if we might be able to set up a call with you for sometime this week, to ask you some logistical questions 
 we're hoping you might either be able to answer or to point us in the right direction on. Would that be possible? If 
 there are a few times in the coming days that you're free, we can try to figure out a slot that works for everyone.

 Marc and Andy, 
 I'm writing to ask for one point of clarification regarding the estate's position regarding the assertion of attorney-client 
 privilege. You previously conveyed to us that the estate asserted privilege with respect to devices the FBI seized from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI in 2019. We accordingly assembled a firewall team to conduct a 
 privilege review of the contents of those devices. 
 The FBI is also in possession of a computer that the Palm Beach Police Department seized from Epstein's residence in Palm 
 Beach in 2005, which our office has not reviewed. Is the estate also asserting privilege with respect to devices such as this 
 one that were seized in Florida in 2005? 
 Thank you,

 We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
 call to discuss. 
 1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
 (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
 not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
 2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
 must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
 on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
 advise which way you would like to proceed. 
 3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
 the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
 missing attachments, if they exist. 
 4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
 by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
 afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
 "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
 EFTA00029942
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
 These fall into the following buckets: 
 a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
 "date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
 seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
 were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
 reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
 files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
 intentional or are we missing those documents? 
 Please let us know your responses as soon as possible. 
 Thanks,

 Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
 contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
 we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload 
 those materials right away.

 Chris, 
 We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
 let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
 responses: 
 1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
 the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
 the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
 Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
 legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
 2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
 new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
 if you would like to provide one for us. 
 3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
 similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
 recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
 each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
 showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
 5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
 SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
 CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
 the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
 have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
 6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
 note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
 was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
 none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
 EFTA00029945
SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566, though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
 they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
 these images would not have CART numbers. 
 7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
 them.

 We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
 call to discuss. 
 1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
 (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
 not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
 2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
 must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
 on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
 advise which way you would like to proceed. 
 3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
 the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
 missing attachments, if they exist. 
 4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
 by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
 afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 EFTA00029946
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
 "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
 provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
 These fall into the following buckets: 
 a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
 "date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
 seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
 were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
 you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
 c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
 reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
 files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
 metadata for these files. 
 7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
 intentional or are we missing those documents? 
 Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

 SEALED ORDER 
 SARAH NETBURN United States Magistrate Judge 
 *1 The United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
 New York has moved, pursuant to the All Writs Act, Title 28, 
 United States Code, Section 1651, for an order relieving Boies 
 Schiller & Flexner LLP (the "Law Finn") of its obligations 
 under the protective order issued on November 29, 2018, 
 in Jane Doe 43 v. Jeffrey Epstein. et al. I7-CV-616 (IGK) 
 (SN) (S.D.N.Y.). The purpose of such order is to permit the 
 Law Firm to comply with a grand jury subpoena and provide 
 materials to the Government in connection with a federal 
 grand jury investigation. The motion is DENIED without 
 prejudice. 
 BACKGROUND 
 The Law Firm represented Jane Doe 43, a plaintiff in a civil 
 suit against Jeffrey Epstein and others. The case involves 
 allegations of sex trafficking. Because of the sensitive nature 
 of some of the discovery, the parties entered into a Protective 
 Order that deemed certain information to be "Confidential 
 Information."' Protective Order, at ECF No. 177. As 
 relevant here, the Protective Order provides that Confidential 
 Information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose 
 other than the civil case. Id. at 1 4. At the conclusion of 
 the case, the Protective Order requires the destruction of 
 Confidential hard-copy documents or electronic files. Id. at 1 
 12. The Protective Order further prohibits the distribution of 
 Confidential electronic non-file copies without a court order. 
 Id. The Protective Order contemplates that a subpoena for 
 Confidential Information may be received and precludes the 
 receiving party from complying with the subpoena absent a 
 court order. Id. at ¶ 13. Finally, the Protective Order permits 
 modification by the Court "at any time for good cause shown 
 following notice to all parties and an opportunity for them to 
 be heard." Id. at 1 15. 
 The United States Attorney has served a grand jury subpoena 
 on the Law Firm for documents that are covered by the 
 Protective Order. 2 The Government has represented that 
 the subpoena was validly issued as part of an ongoing 
 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for possible 
 violations of, Title IS, United States Code, Section 591 and 
 I 594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and Section 2422(b) 
 (unlawfully enticing minors). The production of the materials 
 pursuant to the subpoena is solely for the purposes of the 
 Investigation and is subject to the protections and restrictions 
 of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The Law Finn 
 has indicated its willingness to comply with the subpoena so 
 long as it is authorized to do so by a court order modifying 
 the Protective Order. 
 DISCUSSION 
 *2 The All Writs Act provides, in relevant part, that "all 
 courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs 
 necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions 
 and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." 28 
 U.S.C. § 1651(a). The All Writs Act permits a court, in its 
 "sound judgment," to issue orders necessary "to achieve the 
 rational ends of law" and "the ends of justice entrusted to 
 it." United States v. New York Telephone Co 434 U.S. 
 159, 172.73 (1977) (internal quotation marks and citations 
 omitted). The All Writs Act provides a "residual source of 
 authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by 
 statute." Penn. Bureau of Con. v. U.S. Marshals Serv. 
 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985). "Although the Act empowers federal 
 courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, 
 it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever 
 compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient 
 or less appropriate." Id. The Court finds that it is authorized 
 under the All Writs Act to modify the Protective Order. 
 The Court, however, declines to exercise its discretion to 
 modify the Protective Order on the record before it. Before 
 modifying a protective order on which parties to a civil 
 action presumptively relied, the Court of Appeals for the 
 Second Circuit has directed district courts to find either 
 that: (1) the protective was improvidently granted or (2) the

 EFTA00029951
IN RE APPLICATION TO UNSEAL CIVIL DISCOVERY..., Slip Copy (2021) 
 government has established exceptional circumstances or a 
 compelling need. In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 
 945 F.2d 1221, 1224 (2d Cir. 1991); see also ? Martindell 
 v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp. 594 F.2d 291 (2d 
 Cir. 1979). Because the Government does not argue that 
 the Protective Order was improvidently granted (nor could 
 it), and because the Government has not, on this record, 
 established exceptional circumstances or a compelling need, 
 the motion to modify is denied. 
 The Government argues that the presumption against 
 modifying protective orders articulated in Martindell and In 
 re Grand Jury does not apply here for two reasons. First, the 
 Government argues that the standard from those cases applies 
 only to their specific procedural posture, specifically a motion 
 to quash (In re Grand Jury) or an informal request without a 
 grand jury subpoena (Martindell). This is a distinction without 
 a difference. Nothing in those decisions cabins the rule to 
 the procedural posture presented, and there is no logical 
 reason to think a different standard should apply when the 
 subpoena's recipient does not move to quash. If anything, 
 the presumption of confidentiality applies more forcefully 
 where, as is the case here, the Government's confidential 
 application deprives the interested party of the chance to 
 quash the subpoena. 
 Second, the Government argues that the presumption does not 
 apply because the Protective Order protects only documents 
 exchanged in pretrial litigation. It is true that the Court of 
 Appeals has said the presumption may not apply in some 
 cases because the expectation of continued confidentiality 
 was unreasonable. See ? SEC v. TheStreet.com 273 F.3d 
 222, 231 (2d Cir. 2001) ("[S]ome protective orders may 
 not merit a strong presumption against modification. For 
 instance, protective orders that are on their face temporary 
 or limited may not justify reliance by the parties."); see also 
 In re "Agent Orange" Prod. Liah. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 
 147 (2d Cir. 1987) ("[A]ppellants ... could not have relied 
 on the permanence of the protective order. The ... order by 
 its very terms was applicable solely to the pretrial stages of 
 the litigation."). But this is not a case where the "conditions 
 contemplated by the Court for revisiting the Protective Order 
 have now occurred." ? Allen v. City of N.Y. 420 F. Supp. 2d 
 295, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). All parties to the Protective Order 
 have not been given notice and an opportunity to be heard. See 
 Protective Order ¶ 15. And although the Order contemplates 
 the disclosure of Confidential Information during trial, see id. 
 1 14, that condition never arose. Instead, the parties settled, 
 thereby foreclosing the possibility of atrial. Reliance on the 
 continued effect of the Protective Order was and is, therefore, 
 entirely reasonable. See SEC v. TheStreet.com 273 F.3d 
 222, 230 (2d Cir. 2001) ("In some cases, settlement would not 
 be possible but for the parties' reliance on a protective order.... 
 Thus, another compelling reason to discourage modification 
 of protective orders in civil cases is to encourage testimony in 
 pre-trial discovery proceedings and to promote the settlement 
 of disputes."). 
 *3 In response to an identical application seeking to modify 
 a protective order in a different case between Epstein and an 
 alleged victim, another judge in this District has reached a 
 different conclusion. That judge found that Epstein's reliance 
 on the protective order in that case was not reasonable, and 
 therefore modified its terms to allow the Law Firm to respond 
 to the grand jury subpoena. I reach a different conclusion. 
 Courts look to four factors when assessing whether reliance 
 on a protective other was reasonable: "(I) the scope of the 
 protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the 
 level of inquiry the court undertook before granting the order, 
 and (4) the nature of reliance on the order"? I In re Ethylene 
 Propylene 255 
 F.R.D. 308, 318 (D. Conn. 2009). The Protective Order is 
 not a blanket order that might be disfavored; instead, the 
 definition of Confidential Information is limited and subject 
 to objective standards, and the parties may designate material 
 only in "good faith" after attorney review. Protective Order 
 11
 3 , 8. The Court entered the Protective Order after briefing, 
 oral argument, and a direction from the Court to make 
 modifications to their proposals. See ECF Nos. 163-177. The 
 Protective Order's language also specifically contemplated 
 that confidentiality would not be waived a parte where the 
 government has subpoenaed documents that were exchanged 
 in discovery but never used at trial. Protective Order ¶ 15 
 ("This Protective Order may be modified ... following notice 
 to all parties and an opportunity for them to be heard."). 
 Finally, no Confidential Information was filed with the Court 
 after the entry of the Protective Order such that the parties 
 could anticipate its public disclosure. 3 On this record, the 
 Court finds that the parties' reliance on the Protective Order 
 was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality should 
 apply. 
 Thus the Martindell/In re Grand Jury Subpoena test applies 
 here. Under that standard, the Government's arguments 
 for exceptional circumstances and compelling need are 
 WESTLAW © 2021 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 
 EFTA00029952
IN RE APPLICATION TO UNSEAL CIVIL DISCOVERY..., Slip Copy (2021) 
 unpersuasive. The Government argues that it needs the 
 protected documents because issuing subpoenas to other 
 sources would alert the investigation's targets, possibly 
 leading them to destroy evidence or flee prosecution. But 
 the Government has not offered any affirmations or facts 
 suggesting that the evidence in the Law Firm's possession 
 cannot be obtained from other sources without compromising 
 the investigation. Instead, it relies on the general desire 
 for secrecy. That abstract concern, which applies to all 
 confidential grand jury investigations, is not "a showing 
 of exceptional circumstances or compelling need." In re 
 Grand Jury, 945 F.2d at 1224.4 Indeed, if anything, the 
 extraordinary posture of the case requires the Court to police 
 carefully government intrusions into areas of protections 
 agreed to by civil litigants and so-ordered by the Court. 
 The Government is attempting to side-step these protections 
 by serving a subpoena only upon a party who is willing 
 (and perhaps eager) to comply with the Government's 
 investigation. 
 *4 The subject matter of the Government's investigation 
 is obviously serious. But to pierce the Protective Order, the 
 Government must demonstrate not that this investigation is 
 an extraordinary circumstance, but that the reason for seeking 
 the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is 
 a need to modify the Protective Order. The Government has 
 not met that standard. 
 CONCLUSION 
 The motion for an order relieving the Law Firm of its 
 obligations under the Protective Order to comply with the 
 grand jury's subpoena is DENIED without prejudice. This 
 order does not preclude the Law Firm from producing 
 material in its possession responsive to the subpoena that 
 is not covered by the Protective Order. It also does not 
 preclude the Law Firm from disclosing to the Government 
 an inventory of material in its possession that was marked 
 confidential pursuant to the Protective Order in order to allow 
 the Government to renew its application to the Court to 
 establish extraordinary circumstances or a compelling need 
 for the materials it seeks. 
 Because the Government's application is filed in connection 
 with an on-going criminal investigation, this Order and all 
 other documents filed within this Miscellaneous Case will 
 remain UNDER SEAL until further Court Order. 
 SO ORDERED.

 1 The Protective Order covers "information whose public release would violate common law and 
 statutory privacy interests, including information reflecting medical or psychological conditions, medical or 
 psychological treatment, prescriptions for controlled substances, non-public personal financial information, 
 sexual activity or sexual contact, education records, email addresses, telephone numbers, home addresses, 
 social security numbers and similarly personally identifying information for parties and third-party witnesses, 
 any information subject to? I NY. Civil Rights Law § 50 or? 151, or any other information deemed private by 
 a Court of competent jurisdiction to include the tort of publication of private facts." Protective Order, 1 3. 
 2 Because the Government has not provided the Court with a copy of the subpoena, the scope of that subpoena 
 is unknown. 
 3 The other decision found that reliance on a protective order is not reasonable when the order contemplates 
 that the confidential material may become public if used at trial. But that is an argument in favor of finding 
 reliance on all protective orders unreasonable. The public has a strong presumption in favor of accessing 
 trial documents. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) ("[The First 
 Amendment] provides the public and the press a constitutional right of access to all trials, criminal or civil.")

 4 The Government also argues that the Confidential Information covered by the Protective Order is not the 
 sort of sensitive information that has been protected in the past, such as trade secrets. The fact that the 
 protected material here is not of a specific type that has arisen in prior cases does not suggest that this case 
 is extraordinary.

 FYI, the lawsuit was resolved and has now been dismissed, but Judge Koeltl handled this differently from the other case 
 (opinion attached). I plan to ask for a copy of the materials disclosed to Maxwell's team when we speak to

 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 JANE DOE, 
 Plaintiff, 
 - against - 
 DARREN K. INDYKE, RICHARD D. KAHN, 
 AND GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 Defendants. 
 20-cv-484 (JGK) 
 MEMORANDUM OPINION 
 AND ORDER 
 JOHN G. KOELTL, District Judge: 
 The plaintiff brought this action under a pseudonym as "Jane 
 Doe" against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their 
 capacities as appointed executors of the estate of Jeffrey E. 
 Epstein (together, the "Epstein Estate"), and Ghislaine Maxwell, 
 seeking declaratory relief and damages for sexual assault, sexual 
 battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent 
 infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment. The 
 plaintiff now moves for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the 
 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons explained below, 
 the motion is granted, subject to certain conditions. 
 I 
 The plaintiff filed the complaint in this action on January 
 17, 2020. For the purposes of this motion, the substance of the 
 claims is relevant only insofar as to note that on June 29, 2020, 
 Ms. Maxwell was indicted on criminal charges in this District. See 
 ECF No. 1, 20-CR-330. On September 14, 2020, Magistrate Judge 
 EFTA00029956
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 2 of 8 
 Freeman issued an order staying this case, pending the outcome of 
 the criminal prosecution of Ms. Maxwell. See ECF No. 8. 
 After the complaint was filed, the Epstein Estate set up the 
 Epstein Victim's Compensation Program (the "Program") and the 
 administrator started accepting claims on June 25, 2020. See ECF 
 No. 47. On November 29, 2020, the plaintiff accepted an offer of 
 compensation from the Program, which requires her to dismiss with 
 prejudice her claims against the defendants in this action. See 
 ECF No. 94. To satisfy the requirement, the plaintiff sought 
 dismissal with prejudice by stipulation pursuant to Rule 
 41(a) (1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See ECF 
 No. 87. The stipulation provided that "each party shall bear its

 stipulation, counsel for Ms. Maxwell declined to sign the

 accordance with the terms set forth in the partially-executed 
 stipulation.

 files a responsive pleading or with consent of all parties], an 
 action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court 
 order, on terms that the court considers proper." Fed. R. Civ. P. 
 41(a) (2); see also Paysys Int'l, Inc. v. Atos IT Servs. Ltd., 901 
 F.3d 105, 108 (2d Cir. 2018).1 "Rule 41(a)(2) dismissals are at the 
 district court's discretion and only will be reviewed for an abuse 
 of that discretion." D'Alto v. Dahon Cal., Inc., 100 F.3d 281, 283 
 (2d Cir. 1996). Once the district court articulates its terms for 
 dismissal, "plaintiff . . . has the choice between accepting the 
 conditions and obtaining dismissal and, if [the plaintiff] feels 
 that the conditions are too burdensome, withdrawing [the 
 plaintiff's] dismissal motion and proceeding with the case on the 
 merits." Paysys, 901 F.3d at 109. 
 III 
 Ms. Maxwell objects to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss with 
 prejudice insofar as the motion incorporates the terms set forth 
 in the stipulation and requests that any dismissal be subject to 
 two conditions. First, Ms. Maxwell requests that the provision in 
 the stipulation that "each party shall bear its own attorney's 
 fees and costs of suit" be stricken and that additional language 
 be inserted to preserve her rights to seek her costs as the 
 prevailing party in this action, and to sue plaintiff for damages 
 in a subsequent action. Second, Ms. Maxwell requests that she be 
 provided with the unredacted copy of the release that the 
 2 Unless otherwise noted, this Memorandum Opinion and Order omits all 
 alterations, citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks in quoted text. 
 3 
 EFTA00029958
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 4 of 8 
 plaintiff has signed under the Program. The release allegedly 
 includes the plaintiff's name and the compensation for the 
 release. 
 A 
 Ms. Maxwell's request regarding costs and fees has two 
 components: (1) the provision that "each party shall bear its own 
 attorney's fees and costs of suit" should be stricken; and (2) the 
 condition should include the language that "[n]othing herein shall 
 be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking fees or costs 
 related to this matter from plaintiff or from [the Epstein 
 Estate.]" See Proposed Order at 2, ECF No. 93-2. 
 The provision of the stipulation that "each party shall bear 
 its own attorney's fees and costs of suit" is indeed inconsistent 
 with the provision in the stipulation proposed by the plaintiff 
 that "nothing herein shall be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell 
 from seeking fees or costs related to this matter from the 
 [Epstein Estate]." Accordingly, the provision must be modified to 
 state that "the plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear 
 their own attorney's fees and costs of suit." 
 In addition, Ms. Maxwell also requests that the condition 
 specify that she may seek fees and costs from the plaintiff in 
 addition to the Epstein Estate. Ms. Maxwell argues that she is the 
 prevailing party in this litigation and, pursuant to Rule 54(d), 
 she should be allowed to seek costs from the plaintiff. Moreover, 
 Ms. Maxwell claims she should not be prejudiced from bringing a 
 4 
 EFTA00029959
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 5 of 8 
 separate action against the plaintiff for damages—including 
 attorney's fees incurred in this action—for the torts of abuse of 
 process and malicious prosecution. Ms. Maxwell is correct that 
 under Second Circuit law, she is the prevailing party for the 
 purposes of Rule 54(d). See Carter v. Inc. Vill. of Ocean Beach, 
 759 F.3d 159, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that where a 
 plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its case against one defendant 
 with prejudice, that defendant was a prevailing party under Rule 
 54(d)) . And under Rule 54(d), "costs—other than attorney's fees—
 should be allowed to the prevailing party." Fed. R. Civ. P. 
 54(d) (1) . Therefore, a condition that precludes Ms. Maxwell from 
 seeking costs from the plaintiff would prejudice her from 
 exercising the rights she would normally have under Rule 54(d), 
 and therefore, cannot be included. See Cross Westchester Dev. 
 Corp. v. Chiulli, 887 F.2d 431, 432 (2d Cir. 1989) ("The purpose 
 of authorizing terms and conditions on a voluntary dismissal is to 
 protect the defendant from prejudice."). 
 Furthermore, the stipulation in the amended form—that is, 
 "the plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear their own 
 attorney's fees and costs of suit"—should not affect Ms. Maxwell's 
 ability to bring a future claim against the plaintiff for abuse of 
 process or malicious prosecution. Accordingly, the condition 
 related to costs and fees, in its entirely, is as follows: "The 
 plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear their own 
 attorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing herein shall be 
 5 
 EFTA00029960
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 6 of 8 
 construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking fees or costs 
 related to this matter from the Epstein Estate and from the 
 plaintiff." 
 8 
 With respect to the second request, Ms. Maxwell seeks to be 
 provided with an unredacted copy of the release that would 
 indicate who the plaintiff is and the amount of compensation that 
 the plaintiff has received. On the one hand, the plaintiff has an 
 understandable interest in maintaining her anonymity, and the 
 Court entered an order to protect it. See ECF No. 32. On the other 
 hand, it is important for Ms. Maxwell to know the name of the 
 plaintiff so that if Ms. Maxwell is sued by the plaintiff, she can 
 use the release as well as the dismissal with prejudice as a 
 defense in that lawsuit. Further, if the plaintiff were to appear 
 as a witness against Ms. Maxwell in Ms. Maxwell's criminal trial, 
 it would be important for Ms. Maxwell to be able to use the 
 release as possible impeachment material against the plaintiff. 
 Each party's interest can be protected by requiring that the 
 unredacted copy of the release be provided to Ms. Maxwell, but 
 that it not be disclosed for any purpose without the prior 
 approval of this Court. This will assure that the unredacted copy 
 of the plaintiff's release is used only for a proper purpose. 
 C 
 Because the conditions added to the stipulation affect the 
 rights of each of the parties, each of the parties should be given 
 6 
 EFTA00029961
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 7 of 8 
 an opportunity to decide whether that party is prepared to proceed 
 with the dismissal as provided in the partially-executed 
 stipulation and with the changes provided by the Court. Each of 
 the parties must indicate that party's acceptance of the 
 conditions specified by the Court by March 19, 2021. If any party 
 does not agree by that date, the motion to dismiss is denied and 
 the case will be stayed. If all parties agree by that date, the 
 case will be dismissed with prejudice subject to the stipulation 
 with the changes proposed by the Court. 
 CONCLUSION 
 The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the 
 parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, the arguments 
 are either moot or without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the 
 motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted, subject to the 
 following conditions: 
 (1) The plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear 
 their own attorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing 
 herein shall be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from 
 seeking fees or costs related to this matter from the 
 Epstein Estate and from the plaintiff; 
 (2) The plaintiff shall provide an unredacted and signed 
 copy of the General Release (the "Release") the 
 plaintiff executed with the Program by March 23, 2021, 
 together with a certification of its authenticity. The 
 Release is subject to the Order on Plaintiff's Anonymity

 in this action and shall not be disclosed except 
 pursuant to an Order of this Court. 
 Each of the parties must indicate that party's acceptable of 
 the terms of the stipulation and the additional conditions 
 specified above by March 19, 2021. If any party fails to agree by 
 that date, the motion to dismiss is denied and the case will be 
 stayed. If all parties agree by that date, this case will be 
 dismissed with prejudice, subject to the stipulation with the 
 changes proposed by the Court.

 Re: United States v. Chislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of 
 August 10, 2020 (the "Defense Letter" or "Def. Ltr."), requesting that the Court order the 
 Government to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses 1I months prior to trial, and 
 requesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of 
 the Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied. 
 A. The Defendant's Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses 
 For the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the 
 Court for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2020 (Dkt. 28) 
 (denying the defendant's request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and 
 attorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements "concerning this case"); Order 
 dated July 30, 2020 (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant's application for a protective order that would 
 allow the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant's most recent 
 application, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the 
 form of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the "Indictment"), 
 fully 11 months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of 
 discovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
 had no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
 including for witness lists and 3500 material. 
 In the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production, 
 arguing that "almost six weeks since" the arrest of the defendant, the Government is "just now 
 beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would 
 begin as soon as the Court entered a protective order." Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the 
 Government somehow delayed that initial production is nonsense. As the Court is aware, the 
 EFTA00029966
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 41 Filed 08/13/20 Page 2 of 5 
 Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
 August 13, 2020 
 Page 2 
 protective order was docketed on Friday, July 31, 2020'—the timing of which was principally the 
 result of the defendant's own refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed protective order. The 
 Government then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than 12,000 
 pages the following Wednesday, August 5, 2020. Additionally, the Government continues to 
 produce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense 
 counsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than 150,000 pages, principally consisting of 
 financial records.2 Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of 
 electronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial 
 discovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has 
 now produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 21, 2020, and 
 approximately 11 months prior to trial. 
 In sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations, 
 providing more than 165,000 pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks following the 
 entry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the 
 general topics and sources of the materials. 
 Against this backdrop, the Defense Letter claims that over the course of just five days, 
 defense counsel determined, having "expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level 
 content," Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based 
 on the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the 
 defendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied. 
 Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in 
 the litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately 11 months before 
 trial —nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel, 
 United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975), although the opinion acknowledged 
 the ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the 
 Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to do so in that case 
 because the defendant there, as here, had made "only an abstract, conclusory claim that such 
 disclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial." Id. at 301-02. In United States v. 
 Rueb, 00 Cr. 091 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at '8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001), while the Court ordered 
 the Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial, 
 following the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those 
 circumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District 
 of New York opinion from 2009 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court 
 ' The Defense Letter states that the protective order was "entered" by the Court on July 30, 2020. 
 While that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on 
 July 31, 2020. 
 2 The Government's most recent discovery transmittal letter also included the months and years of 
 birth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether 
 she will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline 
 for any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.

 ordered disclosure of a certain victim identity shortly after the indictment, the Court noted that the 
 Government had already confirmed to the defendant the identities of three of the four relevant 
 victims, and that a fourth victim, whose identity was at issue, was the subject of a charge that failed 
 to identify the date of her alleged rape or any prior encounters between the victim and the 
 defendant. 2009 WL 427111, at *2. None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the 
 Indictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the 
 defendant's conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.' 
 To the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges 
 against her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such 
 motion can be made in December with all other motions and following the completion of 
 discovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of 
 this case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be 
 meaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery. See United States v. 
 Mahabub, 13 Cr. 908 (AJN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2014) (denying a 
 motion for a bill of particulars that sought, among other things, the "alleged victim and noting that 
 "[a] bill of particulars is not required unless the charges of the indictment are so general that they 
 do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused. The government can also 
 discharge its obligation to disclose this information by other means, such as by presenting evidence 
 in discovery. . . . A bill of particulars is not meant to provide the details of the government's 
 evidence, or to be used as an investigative tool.") (emphasis added, quotations and citations 
 omitted); see also United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *7 
 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars and noting that such motions 
 are not "a general investigative tool, a discovery device or a means to compel the government to 
 disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial") (emphasis added) (quotations and 
 citation omitted); cf. United States v. Sindone, 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *2 
 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars to identify "the unnamed 
 alleged victim(s)" but instructing the government to disclose the name of any victim it did not 
 intend to call as a witness at trial by 14 days prior to the start of trial). 
 Alternatively, to the extent defense counsel is unable to assess or comprehend the discovery 
 produced by the Government, the Government is more than willing to discuss with the defense 
 3 Defense counsel's invocation of the protective order in support of its argument, Def. Ltr. at I, 3, 
 should be of little comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the 
 defendant's counsel who represent her in both this criminal matter as well as in certain civil 
 matters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials 
 in discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant's counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing 
 that they purportedly had received "critical new information" from the criminal case that it could 
 not disclose "because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action," and further noting 
 publicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in 
 the civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
 No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. 1100). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to 
 scrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal 
 standards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.

 any such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the 
 Government a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared 
 to engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure 
 of 3500 material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce 
 reasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2021 to permit the defense to investigate witnesses. 
 But particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government's strong desire to protect the 
 privacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant's request, the 
 Government respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly 
 three months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial 
 motions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the 
 identity of its witnesses. 
 B. The Defendant's Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement 
 The defendant's requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the 
 Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request 
 that the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") should also 
 be denied.' 
 As an initial matter, the defendant's argument that she is being treated "worse" than other 
 inmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is 
 entirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has 
 never before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison. 
 Additionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her 
 person or space as appropriate.5 It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific "privileges given to 
 other pretrial detainees" the defendant believes she is being denied. 
 More generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized 
 assessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons 
 including safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the 
 determination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style 
 accommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will 
 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made little 
 or no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government 
 learned of the defendant's specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time 
 from the Defense Letter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues 
 as appropriate. Moreover, as noted below, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the GOP's 
 plan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and 
 ultimately modify) that plan. 
 5 Defense counsel claims that prison staff "constantly observe" the defendant "including her phone 
 conversations with defense counsel." This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is 
 able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
 MDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete 
 calls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.

 continue to evaluate where the defendant should be housed within the facility and that the 
 defendant will be placed into the general population if and when BOP is assured that such 
 placement would not pose a threat to the orderly operation of the institution. The defendant 
 identifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that, 
 as detailed below, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery 
 in this case. 
 Regarding the defendant's request in connection with access to discovery, the Government 
 understands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government's 
 first discovery production at the time the Defense Letter was filed—she received the materials on 
 Tuesday, August II. While it is correct that GOP's initial plan was to provide three hours per day 
 of access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including 
 those with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2021-as of earlier this week, and given 
 the volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity 
 to access to her discovery from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day of the week. Although this 
 arrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and 
 is subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on 
 an ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this 
 application should be denied as moot. 
 C. Conclusion 
 For the reasons set forth above, the defendants' requests, as set forth in the Defense Letter, 
 should be denied.

 MEMORANDUM 
 OPINION AND ORDER 
 ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 On August 10, 2020, the Defendant filed a letter motion related to two issues. Dkt. No. 
 38. First, the Defendant seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense counsel 
 immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Second, the 
 Defendant seeks an order directing the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to release the Defendant into 
 the general population and to provide her with increased access to the discovery materials. For 
 the reasons that follow, Defendant's requests are DENIED without prejudice. 
 I. The Disclosure of Alleged Victims' Identities 
 The Defendant first seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense 
 counsel immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Dkt. 
 No. 38 at I. Her request is premature. Production of discovery, which may itself identify 
 alleged victims and relevant witnesses to the defense, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
 not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
 including witness lists and § 3500 material. The Court is mindful of the factors pointed to by the 
 Defendant —in particular the fact that charges in this matter relate to conduct that allegedly took 
 place many years ago—and anticipates that such a schedule would require the disclosure of 
 1 
 EFTA00029971
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 2 of 4 
 alleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify 
 such relief at this very early stage. Following the close of discovery, the parties should meet and 
 confer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors. If the parties are unable to 
 reach agreement as to a pretrial disclosure schedule, the Defendant may renew her request. The 
 denial is therefore without prejudice. 
 II. The Defendant's Conditions of Confinement 
 In her August 10, 2020 letter motion, the Defendant also sought "an order directing 
 [BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with 
 increased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully 
 participate in the preparation of her defense." Dkt. No. 38 at 1. The Government responded that 
 the BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement so that she has access to 
 discovery materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 41 at 5. The Defendant's 
 reply credited the GOP's change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to "confirm these 
 changes in an order to the BOP" and "that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the 
 same privileges given to other detainees." Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5. 
 The Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that 
 allow her access to discovery materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the 
 preparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary. 
 Should facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient 
 access to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court. 
 The Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell "be monitored 
 in the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. 
 2 
 EFTA00029972
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 3 of 4 
 Maxwell the same privileges given to other detainees." Dkt. No. 42 at 5. In a footnote, the 
 defense clarifies that "[a]s long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same manner, and receives 
 the same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general 
 population." Dkt. No. 42 at 5 n.4. 
 The Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant's request for an order directed to 
 BOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that "[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is 
 able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
 MDC staff," thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell's ability to communicate with her counsel is in 
 no way interfered. Dkt. No. 41 at 4 n.5. And as to the more general implementation of 
 surveillance procedures, the Court credits GOP's duty to ensure the safety and security of the 
 Defendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 
 (1979) ("Prison administrators ... should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption 
 and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal 
 order and discipline and to maintain institutional security."). Nor does the Defendant provide 
 any basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5. 
 Though pretrial detainees "may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance 
 with due process of law," Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535, it does not follow that surveillance measures 
 are punitive just because the Defendant deems them "onerous." Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The 
 Defendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the 
 surveillance measures are motivated by improper purposes. 
 As a result, Defendant's request is denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to 
 continue to adequately participate in her defense, however, the Court hereby ORDERS the 
 Government to provide written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to the 
 3 
 EFTA00029973
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 4 of 4 
 conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal 
 materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
 III. Conclusion 
 For the reasons stated above, Defendant's requests contained in Dkt. No. 38 are DENIED 
 without prejudice. Following the close of discovery, the parties shall meet and confer on an 
 appropriate schedule for pre-trial disclosures, including the disclosure of § 3500 material, exhibit 
 lists, and witness lists, taking into account all relevant factors. The Government is hereby 
 ORDERED to submit written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to the 
 conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal 
 materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
 SO ORDERED.

 Hi 
 The two drives from PAE are encrypted, so I can't edit them myself and add the iPhone from the shared. I think it will be fairly easy and 
 quick for me to burn two password-protected discs containing the iPhone images, so if you are okay with me doing so, I'll get started 
 on that. If we produce the PAE drive and the password-protected disc, I'll change the language in the cover letter (defense's is 
 attached) to reflect that.

 As an update, the PAE drive that will be delivered to Maxwell is ready to go at my desk. The password is WO-6290_20201104 and, if 
 needed, I can prepare a cover letter containing the password to be included separately from the drive. 
 I've given the other PAE drive to to start making an internal copy for us. Given the large size of data and massive amount of 
 individual file paths on that drive, he estimates it will take a couple days to make the copy. If a delay in getting the drive to defense is 
 an issue, we can connect with and see if there is another solution. 
 Thanks so much! Happy to chat more about this if needed too,

 discovery. Attached please find a copy of the cover memo. 
 I also dropped off a hard drive and CD containing a new discovery production for Maxwell. Attached please find the two 
 cover letters. 
 Last week, we sent out via FedEx a hard drive containing a separate production, which included replacements of 
 numerous files that Maxwell has been unable to review from prior productions. The accompanying cover letters are 
 attached. Would you please confirm that the drive has been provided to Maxwell? 
 Thanks very much, as always, for your help.

 and reviewed dozens of hours of the limited videotape evidence the FBI 
 has thus far been able to recover in the face of technical data recovery 
 issues. 
 The investigation has determined principally that the two prison officers 
 responsible for the SHU area during the night of August 9 and early 
 morning hours of August 10 — Michael Thomas and Tova Noel — did not 
 conduct any of the required institutional "counts" at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 
 5 a.m., nor did they conduct most of the "rounds" they were required to 
 conduct every 30 minutes. In particular, it appears that no prison official 
 observed Epstein from approximately 9:30 pm on the evening of August 
 9 until his body was discovered at approximately 6:30 a.m. the next 
 morning. Thomas and Noel also falsified numerous forms, indicating 
 that they had performed the required rounds and counts overnight 
 although they did not actually do so. Instead, Thomas and Noel were 
 performing other tasks, using the computer, talking, or sleeping during 
 their overnight shift. In addition, the investigation has determined that, 
 contrary to MCC policy and a directive from the Chief Psychologist and 
 then -Warden, Epstein was left without a cellmate from the morning of 
 August 9 through his death on the morning of August 10. It is not clear 
 that either Thomas or Noel was specifically made aware of the directive, 
 although Thomas had been on duty in the SHU during Epstein's prior 
 suicide attempt and they were both trained on MCC policy and had the 
 ability to assign Epstein a new cellmate.

 Nine Trev Prosecution 
 will be presenting on this 
 important gang-violence prosecution, which culminated in a trial 
 conviction last week. 
 In the spring of 2018, our Office began an investigation into high-
 ranking members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, a violent set of the 
 Bloods gang. Working with our law enforcement partners from the 
 NYPD, HSI, and ATF, the team built a racketeering case against some 
 of the highest ranking and most violent members of Nine Trey. Our 
 investigation resulted in charges against 14 members and associates of 
 the gang, including its leaders and shooters. 
 Nine Trey was responsible for distributing large amounts of heroin and 
 fentanyl, as well as brazen acts of violence across New York City, 
 including two shootings in Times Square, a shooting inside the Barclays 
 Center, and other shootings, robberies, and slashings near residential 
 housing complexes. Our investigation included the use of multiple 
 cooperating witnesses, including a world-famous rap artist, who 
 promoted the gang through his music and used the gang for protection 
 and to taunt rivals. 
 Of the 14 defendants, nine pled guilty; three pled guilty pursuant to 
 cooperation agreements; and two were convicted of racketeering and 
 narcotics offenses following trial.

 "Hard Knocks" Prosecution 
 will present on this ar-reac ling sex-tratcking opera ton, 
 w is t ey ave investigated and prosecuted in partnership with the FBI 
 and NYPD. 
 The investigation began when the FBI's Child Exploitation and Human 
 Trafficking Task Force received a tip from a non-profit organization 
 about the sex trafficking of minor victims in and around New York City. 
 Many of these minor victims were residing, or had resided, at a particular 
 foster care facility in Westchester County, the Hawthorne Residential 
 Treatment Facility. The investigation expanded as minor victims 
 identified other minor victims and particular pimps for whom they had 
 worked, including pimps who had used significant violence to force them 
 into prostitution. 
 As part of this investigation, the team has charged 19 defendants in eight 
 separate cases, involving dozens of victims. To date, 13 have been 
 convicted, including two following jut,' trials.

 Dear Mr. Berman 
 Further to my email of yesterday, I have come across some notes that someone sent me in February 
 regarding North Yorkshire Police and child procurer for the elite, Jimmy Savile. The informant mentions 
 ex Surrey Police officer, Mark Williams-Thomas, who is now a well-respected and reputable 
 investigative journalist who has written several books. 
 http://www.williams-thomas.co.uk/ 
 https://www.mirrorco.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-investigator-claims-two-13510102 
 As a police officer, he specialized in major crime and child abuse. I am told that Surrey police DID 
 investigate allegations against Jimmy Savile but they could not pin anything on him, partly due to 
 North Yorkshire Police not disclosing the information that they had on him. Mr. Williams-Thomas might 
 be a helpful contact, particularly with regard to North Yorkshire Police obstruction in child abuse 
 investigations. 
 Also, if you managed to listen to the YOUTUBE interview with ex MI5 operative and now barrister, 
 Michael Shrimpton, he alleges that Thames Valley Police, whom I believe also obstructed the 
 international Project Spade, Toronto-led investigation, has (or had), German operatives (or spies) 
 embedded in Thames Valley Police. Peter and Barbara Hofschroer, were seriously abused by the 
 criminal activities of North Yorkshire Police. There are strong indications that North Yorkshire Police 
 have close allies at extremely senior levels, in both the Austrian and German police, and the Austrian 
 judiciary. I cannot say what, exactly, but have seen the results of obvious transnational criminal 
 collusion. 
 Regards, 
 Yours sincerely, 
 Jean James

 New York, NY 10007 
 Dear Judge Nathan: 
 New York, New York 10011 
 March 31, 2021 
 United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
 S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 This week's filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating 
 issues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to 10 years, the government has added 
 two serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made 
 this move late in the game — with trial set for July 12th—is obvious tactical gamesmanship. 
 Adding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in 
 the government's possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of power. More than 
 doubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from 1994 to 2004 (previously 
 1997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation; 
 requests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed 
 and are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to 
 the new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required. 
 Even more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell's 
 constitutional rights. Her liberty interests now clash with her right to effective assistance of 
 counsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell's detention, its 
 deleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be 
 strong enough to withstand the stress of trial. 
 Counsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This 
 decision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for 
 trial. However, the government's continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names 
 of accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the 
 close of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented 
 trial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested 
 an opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of 
 moving the trial date. 
 EFTA00030015
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 192 Filed 03/31/21 Page 2 of 3 
 LAW OFFICES OF 13O13131 C. STERNHEIM 
 To be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay 
 her trial but rests squarely on the government's late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution. 
 At the initial appearance on July 14, 2020, the defense agreed to the July 12ih trial date 
 based on the government's representation that is would not file a superseding indictment: 
 The trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's 
 approval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is 
 one, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I 
 assume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial 
 schedule but other schedule as well. 
 July 14, 2020 Transcript at 16 -17 (emphasis added). 
 In response, the Court made the following inquiry: 
 Let me go ahead and ask, Mss Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I 
 will ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments 
 adding either defendants or additional charges? 
 Id. at 17. 
 The government confirmed: 
 MS. Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we 
 do not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment. 
 Id. 
 Based on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July 12, 2021 trial date and her 
 lawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date. 
 It was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government 
 belatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The 
 timing suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial 
 motions and government concern about the now-apparent weakness of its case. The government 
 may be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and 
 relied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel's readiness for trial and 
 Ms. Maxwell's prolonged detention. 
 This is no longer the "two-week" trial as represented by the government. By adding 
 charges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally 
 destroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time allotted. The continual media 
 attention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely 
 require the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that constitutional right 
 can be guaranteed.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 192 Filed 03/31/21 Page 3 of 3 
 LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM 
 Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a fair trial with effective assistance of counsel. If counsel feel 
 that additional time is required to guarantee those constitutional rights, Ms. Maxwell will suffer 
 the consequence by her continued detention. The Court has the power — and, indeed, the 
 discretion — to accommodate this constitutional clash. Granting a continuance and releasing Ms. 
 Maxwell on the most restrictive conditions of home detention. Surely, the Court can impose 
 conditions that "clip her wings" and satisfy perceived flight concerns without keeping Ms. 
 Maxwell locked in a BOP cage. 
 As counsel has notified the government, Ms. Maxwell is requesting an in-person 
 arraignment. She will not waive that right, most especially in light of media coverage and the 
 debacle that occurred during a remote proceeding in a related civil case before Judge Preska. 
 In addition, Ms. Maxwell is requesting a bail hearing at which witnesses will testify regarding 
 the purported strength of the government's case. Further, we request that these proceedings be 
 scheduled to coincide with an evidence review session at the U.S. Attorney's Office to be 
 attended by Ms. Maxwell with counsel. 
 Your consideration is greatly appreciated. 
 Very truly yours,

 Thank you for the updated spreadsheets and the information regarding the timing of the review at 500 Pearl. 
 I believe we will be able to have an attorney, investigator and paralegal present at the Bronx warehouse to take photos of 
 the "excluded from transportation" items. Please let us know the particulars for that visit when you have a moment.

 Good morning, 
 Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
 VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
 I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
 can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

 Good evening, 
 Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
 thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
 at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
 the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
 logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
 To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
 previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
 detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
 • These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
 see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
 able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
 spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
 about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
 • These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
 we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
 available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
 to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
 opposed to 18 items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
 the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
 and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
 statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
 to produce for you to review. 
 Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
 at the Bronx warehouse.

 Laura, 
 Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
 modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
 • The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
 Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
 that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
 next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
 have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
 • Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
 500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
 will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
 as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
 may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
 photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
 portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
 • In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
 segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
 witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
 not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
 contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
 review the original recordings themselves. 
 • In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
 will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
 500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
 private meeting space for the defense team. 
 • Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
 2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
 MDC. 
 • Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
 As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
 13 th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
 produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
 Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
 yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
 whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
 • For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
 exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
 to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
 devices and "fragile" items. 
 o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
 inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
 of these same items are insufficient. 
 o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
 which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
 inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
 consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
 o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
 warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
 Court. 
 • For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
 seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
 contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
 outside of those recordings. 
 • As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
 is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
 courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
 for inspection. 
 • We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
 appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
 • We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
 disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
 available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
 • We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
 Street. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
 scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

 Counsel, 
 Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
 arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
 also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
 Physical Evidence 
 • It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
 certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
 preparation of her defense. 
 • We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
 o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
 of transport. 
 o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
 Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
 o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
 productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
 seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
 cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
 o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
 to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
 from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
 o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
 include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
 to you from the search of the New York residence. 
 • The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
 would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
 • Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
 player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
 recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
 equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
 understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
 produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
 not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
 we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
 that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
 EFTA00030025
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
 confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
 • We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
 review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
 cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
 the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
 • As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
 AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
 of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
 proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
 the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
 we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
 defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
 consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
 • The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
 cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
 that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
 above -listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
 images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
 these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
 office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
 • We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
 be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
 defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
 from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

 All, 
 EFTA00030026
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
 case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
 First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
 which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
 physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
 Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
 own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
 which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
 In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
 Physical Evidence 
 • All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
 and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
 accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
 o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
 pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
 photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
 o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
 with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
 o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
 and where they are. 
 • We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
 from Judge Nathan to do so. 
 • Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
 bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
 of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
 March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
 • The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
 confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
 we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
 we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
 review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
 basis. 
 • The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
 view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
 leave of the Court in advance. 
 • We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
 Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
 separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
 government. 
 • Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
 below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
 discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
 • Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
 understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
 for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
 located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
 • During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
 defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly

 All, 
 Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
 discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
 In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
 Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
 • There are three categories of these images: 
 o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
 been previously provided to you) 
 o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
 previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
 o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
 Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
 • The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
 and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
 o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
 be viewed using Cellebrite. 
 o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
 devices. 
 o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
 image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
 other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
 o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
 to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
 • Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
 there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
 to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
 Regarding the physical evidence: 
 • Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
 associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
 FBI New York office's current investigation.

• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
 items (1B 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
 Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
 you will have all evidence in one place. 
 • The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
 following conditions: 
 o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
 place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
 o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
 o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
 o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
 To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
 to be physically present for this review. 
 o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
 may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
 the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
 are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
 presence of nudity. 
 o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
 • To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
 the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
 items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
 Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
 necessary. 
 • The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
 single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
 that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
 anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
 downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
 o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
 residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
 your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
 all of those discs. 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

 Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
 when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
 At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
 Thanks, 
 Laura

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
 Thank you,

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

 Counsel, 
 In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

 Chris, 
 I am going to be tied up for a bit the morning on the 12th. Would it work on your end to meet at the warehouse at 11am, 
 please? The warehouse will be open until 4:30pm, though I'm told I can request additional time in advance if you think 
 the review will take more than 5'A hours. 
 Also, I am working on gathering information in response to Laura's email and expect to be able to respond to it later this 
 evening.

 My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
 for the logistics. 
 Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
 First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
 Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
 NY Evidence List 
 • Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
 • Item 1B13 (1 box) 
 Florida Evidence List 
 . Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
 Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
 photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
 Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
 those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
 Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
 physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
 Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
 recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
 files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
 which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
 date. 
 Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
 "Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
 I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
 agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
 resolve any of them as needed this week. 
 Thank you,

 Hi Laura, 
 The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
 building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
 attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
 AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
 The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
 week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
 review.

 Good morning, 
 Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
 VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
 I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
 can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

 Good evening, 
 Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
 thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
 at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
 the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
 logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
 To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
 previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
 detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
 • These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
 see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
 able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
 EFTA00030038
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
 about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
 • These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
 we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
 available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
 to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
 opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
 the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
 and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
 statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
 to produce for you to review. 
 Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
 at the Bronx warehouse.

 Laura, 
 Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
 modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
 • The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
 Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
 that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
 next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
 have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
 • Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
 500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
 will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
 as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
 may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
 photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
 portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions.

 segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
 witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
 not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
 contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
 review the original recordings themselves. 
 • In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
 will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
 500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
 private meeting space for the defense team. 
 • Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
 2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
 MDC. 
 • Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
 As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
 13 th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
 produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
 Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
 yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
 whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
 • For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
 exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
 to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
 devices and "fragile" items. 
 o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
 inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
 of these same items are insufficient. 
 EFTA00030040
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
 which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
 inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
 consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
 o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
 warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
 Court. 
 • For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
 seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
 contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
 outside of those recordings. 
 • As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
 is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
 courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
 for inspection. 
 • We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
 appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
 • We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
 disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
 available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
 • We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
 Street. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
 scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 Counsel, 
 Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
 arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
 also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
 Physical Evidence 
 • It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
 certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
 preparation of her defense. 
 • We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
 EFTA00030041
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
 of transport. 
 o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
 Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
 o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
 productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
 seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
 cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
 o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
 to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
 from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
 o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
 include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
 to you from the search of the New York residence. 
 . The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
 would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
 • Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
 player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
 recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
 equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
 understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
 produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
 not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
 we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
 that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
 • The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
 confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
 • We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
 review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
 cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
 the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
 • As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
 AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
 of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
 proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
 the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
 we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
 defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
 consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
 . The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
 Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
 cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
 that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
 above -listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
 images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
 these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
 office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
 EFTA00030042
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
 be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
 defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
 from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 All, 
 We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
 case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
 First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
 which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
 physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
 Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
 own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
 which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
 In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
 Physical Evidence 
 • All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
 and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
 accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
 o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
 pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
 photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
 o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
 with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
 o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
 and where they are. 
 • We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
 from Judge Nathan to do so. 
 EFTA00030043
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
 bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
 of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
 March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
 • The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
 confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
 we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
 we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
 review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
 basis. 
 • The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
 view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
 leave of the Court in advance. 
 • We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
 Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
 separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
 government. 
 • Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
 below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
 discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
 Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
 • Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
 understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
 for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
 located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
 • During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
 defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
 confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
 previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
 Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
 Thank you.

 Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
 < 
 All, 
 Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
 discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
 In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
 EFTA00030044
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
 • There are three categories of these images: 
 o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
 been previously provided to you) 
 o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
 previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
 o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
 Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
 • The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
 and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
 o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
 be viewed using Cellebrite. 
 o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
 devices. 
 o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
 image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
 other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
 o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
 to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
 • Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
 there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
 to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
 Regarding the physical evidence: 
 • Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
 associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
 FBI New York office's current investigation. 
 • The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
 items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
 Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
 you will have all evidence in one place. 
 • The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
 following conditions: 
 o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
 place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
 o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
 o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
 o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
 To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
 to be physically present for this review. 
 o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
 may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
 the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
 are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
 presence of nudity. 
 o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
 • To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
 the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
 items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
 Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
 necessary. 
 • The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
 single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
 EFTA00030045
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
 anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
 downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
 o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
 residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
 your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
 all of those discs. 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

 Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
 when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
 At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
 Thanks, 
 Laura

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

 Counsel, 
 In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them. 
 Best,

 Case name: United States v. Turkiye Hall( Bankasi AS, a/k/a "Halkbank" 
 Docket number: S6 15 Cr. 867 (RMB) 
 Brief description of the charges/claims: In October 2019, USAO-SDNY charged Halkbank with fraud, money laundering, 
 and sanctions offenses related to the bank's participation in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on 
 Iran. As set forth in the indictment, an investigation by USAO-SDNY and the FBI revealed that Halkbank and its officers, 
 agents, and co-conspirators directly and indirectly used money service businesses and front companies in Iran, Turkey, 
 the United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere to violate and to evade and avoid prohibitions against Iran's access to the U.S. 
 financial system, restrictions on the use of proceeds of Iranian oil and gas sales, and restrictions on the supply of gold to 
 the Government of Iran and to Iranian entities and persons. Halkbank knowingly facilitated the scheme, participated in 
 the design of fraudulent transactions intended to deceive U.S. regulators and foreign banks, and lied to U.S. regulators 
 about Halkbank's involvement. USAO-SDNY previously tried and convicted Halkbank's former Deputy General Manager 
 of International Banking at Halkbank for his participation in the scheme. 
 Current case status: Trial is scheduled for May 2021. On December 23, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed proceedings in 
 the district court pending expedited resolution of Halkbank's mandamus petition challenging the district court's denial 
 of a motion to dismiss pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

 Case name: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
 Docket number: 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 Brief description of the charges/claims: In July 2020, USAO-SDNY charged Maxwell in a six-count indictment with 
 facilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The 
 charges resulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-
 conspirators, including Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom 
 EFTA00030054
minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein's abusive behavior, 
 and she took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel 
 to Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and 
 subjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in 
 illegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. In a later effort to cover 
 up her crimes, Maxwell lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with 
 minor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
 Current case status: Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, and the Court has denied two separate bail motions, 
 most recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July 2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021.

 Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 : We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
 explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
 and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
 their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
 important differences, including: 
 - The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
 for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
 At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
 the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
 for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
 There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
 room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
 Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can 
 therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access 
 for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
 Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
 receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
 long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
 amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
 As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
 compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
 MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

 Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 All: 
 I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
 sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
 Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
 counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
 general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
 population). 
 Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
 the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
 originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
 new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
 Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
 Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
 review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
 concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which 
 requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
 videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
 each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
 Defenders. 
 At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
 Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
 although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
 letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
 cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
 different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera 
 was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that 
 the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to 
 e lain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with and 
 before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to 
 the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation 
 being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
 Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
 explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
 Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
 counsel/discovery access are as follows: 
 Accommodation N.laxwell Rivera 
 EFTA00030061
Review of electronic 
 discovery (NB: each 
 defendant has laptop access) 
 13 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (91 hours total) 
 3 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (21 hours total) 
 Counsel visits (by video) 3 hours per day/5 days per 
 week (15 hours total) 
 Four hours per week (plus an 
 additional two hours 
 scheduled through the 
 Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
 total) 
 Weekend legal calls As needed Not available 
 The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
 criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
 you were all aware of this issue.  We are also happ to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
 meantime, we are working with to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
 explanation for the Court.

 Apologies — I looked at this as soon as you sent it, but apparently my outlook was frozen and it was hanging in 
 cyberspace. I thought it looked good, although there were some typos which I fixed. I also had a couple of

 Hi Please see our proposed letter, which I understand you would like to review, as well as 
 declarations from associate wardens at the MDC and MCC. The GC and PC chiefs have signed off on 
 these drafts. 
 With apologies for the time sensitivity, our contacts at MCC/MDC have asked to leave early today 
 (before 1/1:30), and have asked us to finalize the declarations as soon as possible.

 Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 : We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
 explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
 and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
 their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
 important differences, including: 
 - The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
 for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
 At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
 the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
 for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
 There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
 room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
 Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can 
 therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access 
 for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
 Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
 receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
 long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
 amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
 As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
 compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
 MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

 Thanks, . Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you 
 know (that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences 
 between MCC and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

 Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
 All: 
 I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
 sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
 Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
 counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
 general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
 population). 
 Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
 the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
 originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
 new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
 Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
 Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
 review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
 concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which 
 requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
 videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
 each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
 Defenders. 
 At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
 Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
 although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
 letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
 cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
 different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera 
 was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that 
 the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to 
 e lain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with and 
 before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to 
 the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation 
 being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
 Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
 explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
 Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
 counsel/discovery access are as follows: 
 Accommodation N.laxwell Rivera 
 EFTA00030066
Review of electronic 
 discovery (NB: each 
 defendant has laptop access) 
 13 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (91 hours total) 
 3 hours per day/7 days per 
 week (21 hours total) 
 Counsel visits (by video) 3 hours per day/5 days per 
 week (15 hours total) 
 Four hours per week (plus an 
 additional two hours 
 scheduled through the 
 Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
 total) 
 Weekend legal calls As needed Not available 
 The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
 criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
 you were all aware of this issue.  We are also happ to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
 meantime, we are working with to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
 explanation for the Court.

 Subject: Gail Collins on Epstein, Acosta and "everything that happens in this country winds up in the hands 
 of New York prosecutors"

 Trump Doesn't Know About Labor 
 Thank God we've got so many inept cabinet members. 
 By Gail Collins 
 July 10, 2019 
 So, did you enjoy the parade for the U.S. women's soccer team? People sure did seem happy. I believe this is partly 
 because the players are terrific and partly because many Americans are desperate to think about something other than 
 Donald Trump. 
 And, good Lord, his crack team of cabinet members. On Wednesday, Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta tried to hold back the 
 outrage that's been building since people learned that, as a federal prosecutor in South Florida, he had brokered a very 
 lenient punishment for Jeffrey Epstein, a rich guy who liked to have sex with underage girls. 
 Explanation: It was a good deal. You know how this administration feels about good deals. 
 "The Palm Beach state attorney's office was ready to let Epstein walk free," Acosta said in his calm, sort of toneless voice. 
 "Our prosecutors ... presented the ultimatum." Which was that Epstein, who had molested a parade of teenagers, some 
 only 14, had to serve at least a little jail time. The punishment Acosta wrangled with his alleged best possible efforts 
 involved 13 months in prison, during which Epstein was free to spend most days at his office as long as he slept overnight 
 in the clink. 
 The victims had no idea that might be the end of the story. The case is now in the hands of federal prosecutors in New 
 York who are going after Epstein on other sex-trafficking charges. (You may have noticed that over the last few years 
 virtually everything that happens in this country winds up in the hands of New York prosecutors.) 
 Do you think Acosta ever asked himself whether he could have fought harder? Nah. The problem was the victims, who 
 were too "scared and traumatized" to be good witnesses. Asked by reporters if he had any regrets, he just said that was "a 
 very hard question." 
 Have you heard anybody in the Trump administration apologize for anything? Well, there was the occasion the secretary 
 of health and human services said he was sorry he spent $400,000 of our tax dollars to fly around in specially chartered 
 planes. But that was a long time and a whole lot of bad behavior ago. 
 About Jeffrey Epstein. He sounds like one of the worst people imaginable, so we are, of course, stunned to hear he used 
 to be tight with our current chief executive. "Terrific guy;' Trump said in an interview with New York magazine in 2002. 
 "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the 
 younger side." 
 The palship no longer exists. "I had a falling-out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I 
 can tell you," said the president, who appears to have erased the lot-of-fun-to-be-with period. 
 EFTA00030071
Are you shocked by any of this? Hey, early in our acquaintanceship we learned Trump is a guy who bragged about being so 
 important he could get away with grabbing women by their private parts. Who was put into office thanks to Russian 
 manipulation of our election. Some days you just want to sigh and talk a lot about women's soccer. 
 Ever since the Epstein scandal arose, Trump has been defending Acosta, stressing what an "excellent" job he's doing. After 
 all, the president told reporters, "our economy is so good, our unemployment numbers are at record lows." You might 
 have thought he was under the impression the secretary of labor had something to do with boosting the economy. As 
 opposed to things like workplace safety and collecting job statistics. 
 And oh, yeah, human trafficking. Very embarrassing that Acosta is one of the people who's supposed to protect underage 
 women from being sold as sex slaves. 
 Hmm. Before this week, what do you think Donald Trump thought the Department of Labor did? 
 A) Something about delivering babies. 
 B) Something about getting good people to, you know, mow the lawn and stuff. 
 C) Something. 
 The president is oblivious, but otherwise almost nobody likes the job Acosta's been doing. People who care about workers 
 are naturally outraged that he's been trying to water down everything from mine safety regulations to the rules that 
 prohibit restaurant managers from grabbing a piece of the waiters' tips. 
 Trump insiders, of course, feel undermining workers' rights is supposed to be Acosta's mission. And they complain he's 
 been sort of inept at it. Mick Mulvaney, the Trump Acting Chief of Staff For Life, has been trying to take control. Recently, 
 Acosta's chief of staff was pushed out for a lack of, um, leadership. Or, as one former administration official told Politico, 
 "There are times when he goes completely loony." 
 You've got to be appalled by Acosta's failure to stand up for vulnerable children being lured into serving as sex playthings 
 for a man who truly does epitomize the concept of filthy rich. 
 But are you upset that Trump is too much of an ethical beanbag to get rid of him? The sad truth is that we're really 
 probably better off with cabinet members too inept to accomplish anything at all. 
 Cheer up. There's always soccer.

 Oh, sorry: our FOIA Tracking Database is designed to cover FOIA requests that are directed to our Office; it 
 does not track FOIA requests to, e.g., the FBI, that end up in litigation in the SDNY and that our Civ Div

 seems like at least one case is missing (there is a civil case involving a FOIA request from Radar Online).

 Hi= 
 Hope you're doing well. and =and I are trying to assemble a list of ever FOIA request our office has ever 
 received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. .uggested that you'd be the 
 best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information: 
 • A list of all FOIA requests our office has received; 
 • For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and 
 • Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is. 
 That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.

 Counsel, 
 Pursuant to the Court's Order dated November 18, 2020, today we are producing materials regarding victims who are not 
 referenced in Indictment number Si 20 Cr. 330 (A1N). Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The 
 production is small enough to produce via an FTP site. Would you please send us a link to use for this production? 
 We will send a CD containing a copy of this production to the MDC for your client to review as well.

 Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
 when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
 At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday?

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
 Thank you,

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 EFTA00030085
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

 Counsel, 
 In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

 discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
 In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
 Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
 • There are three categories of these images: 
 o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
 been previously provided to you) 
 o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
 previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
 o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
 Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
 • The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
 and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
 o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
 be viewed using Cellebrite. 
 o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
 devices. 
 o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
 image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
 other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
 o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
 to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
 • Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
 there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
 to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
 Regarding the physical evidence: 
 • Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
 associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
 FBI New York office's current investigation. 
 • The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
 items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
 EFTA00030101
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
 you will have all evidence in one place. 
 • The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
 following conditions: 
 o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
 place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
 o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
 o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
 o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
 To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
 to be physically present for this review. 
 o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
 may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
 the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
 are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
 presence of nudity. 
 o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
 • To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
 the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
 items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
 Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
 necessary. 
 • The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
 single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
 that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
 anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
 downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
 o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
 residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
 your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
 all of those discs. 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

 Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
 when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
 At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
 attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
 evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
 before we start reviewing evidence. 
 Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
 Thanks, 
 Laura

 Counsel, 
 The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
 asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
 until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
 the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
 highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
 of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
 evidence vault that same week. 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
 Thank you,

 That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
 not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
 discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
 during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
 SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
 As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
 physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

 Counsel, 
 In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
 FBI -Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
 included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
 within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
 our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

 As discussed, attached are the title transfer documents we have for Epstein's New York, Palm Beach, and Virgin Islands 
 residences. I've also included the articles of incorporation for four of the relevant entities referenced in the transfer 
 documents. It appears that we obtained at least some of these documents pursuant to grand jury subpoenas. Let me 
 know if you need us to distinguish between the documents that we found through without a subpoena and those we 
 obtained via subpoena. 
 We do not have documents for the New Mexico property, as far as I can tell, but I'll chat with the team about tracking 
 those down. Please let us know if there are any other materials you need us to find as well.

 Embedded: Booking_Confirmation_ —_Beverly_Hil
 Team, just as an FYI, no obligation at all for anybody else to do this, but I switched my L.A. hotel to a different spot for our 
 upcoming visit — at least through our booking systems, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica during that time is over our 
 allowable daily price for whatever reason — but even more importantly, last time we were there the front desk told me 
 that construction there was going to be a complete nightmare from January through at least March (i.e., all the drilling 
 from last time, but much worse). And I didn't see any other normal / decent business hotels in that area that were within 
 our per diem (with the possible exception of the Le Meridien). 
 However, for the first time in any of the trips we've ever been out there, the Beverly Hilton is listed within our per diem 
 ($181 for the AUSAs), and it's less than a ten minute drive from both attorney's office and attorney's 
 office (and we could of course get a conference room there for ). It's not the fanciest hotel in the world, but it's a 
 normal Hilton, the location is perfect, and no drilling (!), so I went for it and wanted to recommend it and let everybody 
 know. No worries if people prefer elsewhere, but it's an option.

 just FYI, in connection with this trip to Los Angeles, I just made a reservation for a hotel on E2 (see attached) — if I 
 did anything wrong, it can be changed, but it's a hotel that is almost never available for us so I wanted to make the 
 reservation tonight just in case. And will follow up with flights in the coming days. Happy to chat if that's useful, and 
 thanks very much.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request 
 permission for the team to travel next week for three interviews in Los Angeles on February 26, 27, and 28 (we have at 
 least one interview on each of those days). We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 25th to the 
 29th. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those dates (the 
 26th).

 Andy, 
 Three issues: 
 I. We plan to produce the redacted notes to the defense pursuant to the protective order, and the name on an AEO 
 basis to defense counsel. Your letter states that both will be provided on an AEO, which misstates our intention. 
 2. When we discussed this, we understood that this would not be submitted to defense counsel prior to Judge 
 Torres ruling on your request. There is no language in the letter to that effect, and it seems appropriate to add it. 
 3. Please add "to the defense" in the first letter to make clear to the Court that you are intervening in our 
 production of discovery to defense counsel in this matter (and not, for instance, in a disclosure to the public or 
 any other entity). 
 Thanks.

Andy, 
 We cannot agree to these redactions, and think it would be appropriate for you to file a motion before Judge Torres, under 
 seal and copying the Government (but ex parte as to the defense). Could you please send us a copy of the letter before 
 you file it, so that we can ensure that our position is accurately represented? Thanks very much.

 We have attached a proposed disclosure cover letter that is modeled on a letter sent by the Government in United States v. 
 Madonna, 17 Cr. 89 (CS). We have also attached proposed redacted disclosures. As you and I discussed, we offer this as 
 a means to ensure our client's safety while permitting the Government to comply with what you believe are your 
 disclosure obligations. 
 As an alternative, we are willing to apply under seal to Judge Torres for a Protective Order to preclude the disclosure. 
 Our client is not a witness, and so this is not 3500 material, nor is it Rule 16 material. We do not believe that this is in 
 fact Brady material, but rather is an error made by our client that we understand is contradicted by the surveillance video 
 evidence. While we applaud your efforts, we have an obligation to make sure that our client is not harmed by the 
 possible release of the fact that he met with your Office. 
 We understand that you have time constraints. Please let us know how you want to proceed so that we can file a motion 
 before Judge Torres promptly if that is necessary.

 That makes sense, thanks. Our team is available to do Friday at 11:00, and we can host here at our offices, 
 if that still works for you both (and Jenna if she's able to join). On our end I expect it will be prosecutors

 probably join us. 
 I'm not sure whether legally changed her name, or if I was just given her husband's last name

 That's great, thanks — and is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our scheduling, I 
 take it we'll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we're talking about a meeting with the 
 client. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I'll circle back in timing, and will also send you a 
 copy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with her this afternoon. 
 Two other quick things — first, we know your client as but I think you mentioned her name has changed? 
 Could you please let me know her current last name? 
 And second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or anyone 
 associated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection with him. 
 Primarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it's something we don't need to talk to her 
 directly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at this stage, no problem at all, 
 we can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it. 
 thanks,

 Dershowitz Can Pursue Bid To DQ Boies Schiller In 
 Sex Case 
 By Andrew Strickler 
 Share us on: By Andrew Strickler 
 Law360 (June 18, 2019, 6:13 PM EDT) -- The New York federal judge who initially refused to hear Alan Dershowitz's 
 request to disqualify Boies Schiller Flexner LLP from representing a woman accusing the prominent attorney and retired 
 Harvard Law School professor of sexually molesting her said on Monday that she would consider it. 
 In a brief order, U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska allowed Dershowitz's motion to be reinstated and said he could file a 
 28 -page memo on his request. 
 The order comes a week after Judge Preska said she was removing the motion because Dershowitz didn't request a 
 premotion conference before the filing in violation of a court rule. 
 Dershowitz's 
 accuser 
 has alleged that convicted billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein "lent her out for 
 sex" to Dershowitz and that Dershowitz played a role as Epstein's attorney and friend in a human trafficking  scheme 
 during the late 1990s and early 2000s involving dozens of underage girls. 
 In a July 7 motion, Dershowitz argued that Boies Schiller shouldn't be allowed to continue to represent necause 
 the firm has "severe" conflicts in the case. 
 Those stem from an offer made in 2015 by Boies Schiller partner Carlos Sires to represent Dershowitz after Giuffre alleged 
 EFTA00030155
in a separate Crime Victims Rights Act suit focused on Epstein's deal with prosecutors that she had sex with Dershowitz 
 and others. 
 Dershowitz said in his motion he didn't learn Boies Schiller was representing his accuser in the current case until after he 
 shared with Sires a "highly confidential" memo spelling out his legal strategy in the case. The next day, Sires informed 
 Dershowitz that a client conflict was going to prevent him from representing Dershowitz. 
 Last week, Boies Schiller submitted a letter to the court stating that Dershowitz hadn't complied with the premotion 
 conference rule; Judge Preska agreed and ordered his filing "marked off the calendar." 
 "Professor Dershowitz is gratified that the court will consider the motion on its merits," said Dershowitz counsel Arthur L. 
 Aidala and Imran H. Ansari in a statement Tuesday. 
 Giuffre counsel Joshua Schiller of Boies Schiller submitted a letter to Judge Preska on Monday urging her to deny the 
 disqualification request without further briefing. 
 Dershowitz filed the "tactical" motion months into the suit despite having known for some five years that the firm 
 represents =Schiller said. Moreover, Dershowitz's brief contact with Sires never resulted in the formation of an 
 attorney -client relationship. 
 "Even though he knew that BSF's conflict check had not been completed, Dershowitz copied Mr. Sires into a group e-mail 
 attaching a memorandum, which Dershowitz now claims was confidential," Schiller wrote, adding that the memo was 
 addressed to Dershowitz's "friends" and contained no confidential information. 
 "This is an attempt to manufacture a conflict and delay the case and prevent our client from working with the counsel 
 she's worked with for five years," Schiller told Law360. 
 Dershowitz's ties to the Epstein scandal were back in the news after a February ruling by U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. 
 Marra, who found current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta had been among several prosecutors who mishandled a decade-
 old sex crime case against Epstein when they signed a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without notifying his 
 victims. 
 Giuffre is represented by Joshua Schiller and Sigrid McCawley of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. 
 Dershowitz is represented by Imran H. Ansari and Arthur L. Aidala of Aidala Bertuna & Kamins PC. 
 The case is,. Dershowitz, case number 1:19-cv-03377 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
 York.

 The discovery of the photographs will not have any effect on, nor will it alter, the status of his sex offender 
 registration. We have conferred with the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) in Albany in order to 
 obtain his case file which would include the risk assessment. They are in the middle of a multi-year project to 
 digitally scan all of their dots and the Epstein file is with the vendor. We should have it within 10 days.

 Lt. M, 
 Thanks very much for being in touch, and I'm in receipt of your email — should Mr. Epstein be granted bail and released, I 
 will certainly advise his attorneys that he or they must contact you immediately to arrange for the processes required in 
 New York State. I'm also copying my colleagues on the case, prosecutors and S so they're 
 aware of the issue as well. 
 Separately, at the bail hearing yesterday the judge asked if there is any effect from the discovery of nude and partially-
 nude photographs of women and girls who appear to be young, including possibly under 18 years of age, discovered 
 during a search on Saturday in his New York residence. Do you know if there is any impact of that with respect to his 
 New York registration and/or offender status? Or if there's another person I should check with about that? I'm happy to 
 give anyone a call. 
 Similarly, I believe that there may have been a 2011 state risk assessment in connection with Epstein—is it possible to 
 obtain a copy of that?

 Thank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. 
 Epstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish 
 residence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have 
 a new photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance 
 at my office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional 
 questions or concerns in this matter.

 With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is 
 currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, Martin 
 Weinberg, has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with 
 us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but 
 was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state. 
 We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be 
 for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at allpossible to address this issue so Mr. Weinberg can 
 meet with his client this evening? I'm available anytime at o discuss, if that's helpful, or Mr. Weinberg 
 can also be reached directly at if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please 
 just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).

 Hey PCU — As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
 charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
 morning. 
 The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
 charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
 will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this 
 unit will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
 Please join me and in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
 who have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you 
 are free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
 morning at 11.

 Hey I I checked with IT a couple times last week, and since has been out of the office for quite a bit, it 
 seems as if many projects have been put on hold. My understanding, though, is that MIT have been working on 
 creating a copy of the Confidential items on a hard drive for us to give to the FBI, as well as a separate hard drive for our 
 office to have that will contain everything we produced in the Sixth Production. 
 Unfortunately, for the last two weeks or so, I've been having trouble connecting with anyone and getting a clear answer 
 on its progress. I talked with Ken two weeks ago, and he said he'd confirm with and get back to me. I followed up, 
 but still have heard nothing. Then, I talked with from IT on Friday morning, and he said that he would give a call 
 Friday afternoon to check on the drive we had requested. He thought that it was still copying, but he was going to double 
 check on its status. I followed up with IN Friday afternoon and again yesterday afternoon, but haven't heard anything 
 back. I'll follow up again today and hopefully will get a responsel I'll keep you posted. 
 Thank you for your patiencel Hopefully we'll get this resolved soon.

 No rush at all, but I wanted to check in to see what the plan is for getting copies of all the identified Confidential

 "Is the Epstein case going to cause a problem [for confirmation hearings]?" Acosta 
 had been asked. Acosta had explained, breezily, apparently, that back in the day he'd 
 had just one meeting on the Epstein case. He'd cut the non-prosecution deal with 
 one of Epstein's attorneys because he had "been told" to back off, that Epstein was 
 above his pay grade. "I was told Epstein `belonged to intelligence' and to leave it 
 alone," he told his interviewers in the Trump transition, who evidently thought that 
 was a sufficient answer and went ahead and hired Acosta. (The Labor Department 
 had no comment when asked about this.)

 we would be comfortable sharing his. 
 In any event, I have conferred on this end, and we are prepared to accept your advice and allow you to communicate on our

 Also, I think this process started before Jan 2020. I have my notes at the Embassy, but I think I started

 You are aware of our position, and we do not believe any further rehashing of our prior conversations is productive at this 
 point. That said, we can confirm that it is our standard practice to refrain from publicly commenting on the substance of 
 any witness interview, and we intend to abide by that practice in this case. Beyond that, we can make no commitments.

Dear 
 Thank you for your email of 30 January 2020. 
 On 10 January 2020 you personally assured me that any contact between the Duke of York and the DOJ was 
 confidential and would remain confidential within the investigation team in the DOJ and FBI. You said: "We don't 
 intend to share either the contents or the existence of the conversation beyond our chain of command in the DOJ. 
 As well as our partners at the FBI. It is confidential within the investigation team and our supervisors." The note I 
 made of what you said about the confidentiality of the interview process is as follows: "We do not publicise the 
 content or existence of any of our interviews. We can't guarantee that anyone might not share it with some other 
 person or it might be shared with other individuals who might come to have knowledge of its existence, but our 
 office does not advise the press of the interview and doesn't advise other interviewees of the fact the interview has 
 taken place or the contents of those discussions. For example, it was reported widely that our office was 
 attempting to interview your client months ago which was inaccurate. We have been working on this request for 
 several weeks now and it has not hit the press. That is consistent with our processes. We take confidentiality very 
 seriously." 
 At no point did you suggest that, because of a press statement made on behalf of the Duke in November 2019, you 
 or your colleagues in the investigation team would feel able to provide a public commentary on the DOJ's views on 
 the degree of cooperation provided by the Duke. DOJ's first contact of any kind with the Duke was in early January 
 2020, and the first mention of any request for consideration of an interview came solely from you. 
 I object to your wholly inaccurate statement that the Duke has created a public misimpression. The Duke has made 
 it clear that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. The 
 communications between us were intended to enable him to provide that co-operation. In order for this process 
 to continue, I need to emphasise that we regard the confidential treatment of all contacts between the DOJ and 
 the Duke as essential. We do not wish to have any public pronouncements on what we regard as a voluntary and 
 confidential process. Please confirm that any further communications in connection with the requested voluntary 
 interview will be treated as wholly confidential and the DOJ will offer no further commentary on the Duke's co-
 operation.

 Gary, 
 On November 20, 2019, Prince Andrew publicly offered to cooperate with our investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, 
 stating in a press release: "Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their 
 investigations, if required." In early January 2020, our Office responded to the Prince's public offer by contacting you to 
 set up the interview that the Prince claimed to be willing give us. More than three weeks after our initial contact with 
 you, we still had no date for an interview, nor did we even have a commitment from you that the Prince in fact would 
 agree to an interview. 
 On January 27, 2020, at a press event held by Safe Horizon to which Mr. Berman was invited, Mr. Berman was asked: "As 
 part of (the Epstein] investigation have you reached out to interview Prince Andrew, and has he been cooperative?" 
 Mr. Berman responded: "Ordinarily, our office doesn't comment on whether an individual cooperates or doesn't 
 cooperate with our investigation. However, in Prince Andrew's case, he publicly offered, indeed in a press release, 
 offered to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his coconspirators. 
 So I think in that context, it's fair for people to know whether Prince Andrew has followed through with that public 
 commitment. So let me say that the Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew's attorneys 
 and requested to interview Prince Andrew and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation." 
 Mr. Berman's statement corrected a public misimpression — created by the Prince himself — that the Prince is cooperating 
 with our investigation. 
 As soon as the Prince commits to a date for the interview that he so publicly offered to us more than two months ago, we 
 would be prepared to announce that he has agreed to be interviewed.

 Dear,

 Thank you for your email response claiming that US Attorney Berman's statements were factually accurate and 
 did not create a misleading impression. 
 We only have access to edited video and newspaper reporting of what the US Attorney said. Those reports 
 suggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, 
 condemnatory and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been "zero co-
 operation". This is not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements ascribed to 
 Mr Berman and to the Dal/FBI: "F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out to his lawyers 
 EFTA00030193
and asked to interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar with the 
 investigation." (New York Times 27.01.20) and "Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal prosecutors and 
 the FBI hod asked to interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but had been met with a 
 wall of silence"(The Telegraph 28.01.20). 
 Please provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the DOJ/FBI 
 including a transcript of any relevant questions and answers. 
 We note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the DOJ 
 will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our 
 conversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that DOJ personnel and the US Attorney 
 would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular would not 
 comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the Dal. We ask you to confirm 
 that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the DO1.

 Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the 
 issues and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple 
 additional weeks to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to

 separate from a general desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would be

 Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding some 
 of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would expect to 
 approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
 The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
 decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine what 
 topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything that 
 would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell her, as 
 we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is no 
 problem at all. 
 In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
 explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
 comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
 talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
 anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are able 
 to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
 approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
 were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
 victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
 topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
 always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
 In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
 that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
 the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
 discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
 and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
 particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
 you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could facilitate 
 that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure you that 
 every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive experience more 
 generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how we have been able 
 to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely would take the same 
 sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who have spoken with us. 
 Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how our 
 process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that with no 
 obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could just address 
 the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue to appreciate 
 your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
 thank you very much,

 Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
 connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to 
 request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to 
 inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain 
 allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
 Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
 enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an 
 individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the

 Subject: RE: Epstein investigation 
 Jill, 
 Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
 most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
 only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
 country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
 believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
 useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
 the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're 
 of course happy to travel to her.) 
 Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
 working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
 generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
 those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I 
 can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
 With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
 investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
 witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
 change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
 been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
 course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
 follow-up via email. 
 thanks,

 Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
 notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
 As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
 provide any comfort on this?

with the account. Up to 99 supplemental cards may be associated with a single account. If a 
 primary card member has 10 supplemental cards, all II cards would have the same first 11 
 numbers. The last four digits of the 11 respective card accounts would be different. 
 3) CARD DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS) 
 For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on card 
 members into several major categories: Demographic Information ("Demo"), Address, 
 Telephone, Record of Charges ("ROC"), Payment, Wire Payments, Returned Payment, Airline, 
 and IP Address. This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets with each 
 category occupying its own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by 
 labeled columns. If there is no information to report in a particular category, the tab will simply 
 not appear on the spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided 
 below. 
 A. DEMO 
 The Demo tab identifies account details and demographic information for both charge and/or 
 credit card accounts, listing (where available) the cardholder's name, date of birth, and social 
 security number as well as information about the particular credit card product (Gold, Platinum, 
 etc.). 
 B. ADDRESS 
 The Address tab identifies all the addresses that have been associated with each credit card and 
 identifies the type of address (home, business, etc.). 
 C. TELEPHONE 
 The Telephone tab identifies all the telephone numbers that have been associated with each 
 credit card and identifies the type of number (Home, Business, ANI). An ANI number is a 
 phone number from which the card member or another individual called an American Express 
 customer service center about the subject account. The number is captured automatically and the 
 date on which the call was made is provided. 
 D. ROC (Record of Charges or Spend) 
 The ROC tab identifies all completed charges (including credits/retums) a credit card has made 
 over the past five years. The tab identifies the date and amount, in U.S. Dollars, of the charge. 
 In addition, the tab identifies the merchant at which the charge was made (the unique merchant 
 account number, legal and d/b/a name as well as address and industry type). 
 E. AUTHORIZATION REQUEST ("CAS") 
 The CAS tab identifies all the credit requests a credit card has made over the past one year. 
 Every time a card is swiped or keyed into a card reader, a request for credit is sent to American 
 Express and an approval code is returned. The request may be approved, denied, or pended. It is 
 important to remember that while 90% of all credit requests are charged exactly as requested, 
 some credit requests are not charged in the same amount or on the same day. For example, when 
 booking a hotel room for four nights, your credit card is swiped and the amount of a four-night 
 5/14/2019 AXP Restricted Page 2 of 9 
 EFTA00030208
stay is requested; however, your card is not charged at that time but rather at the time of check-
 out, at which time your bill might be for more or less than the original credit request. This tab 
 also identifies whether the payment attempt was made by swiping or keying the card (keying 
 includes internet and phone charges). 
 F. PAYMENT 
 The Payment tab identifies all the payments that have been made against a credit card balance, 
 including dates and amounts, and (where available) information on the bank account on which 
 the payment was drawn. 
 G. RETURNED PAYMENT 
 The Returned Payment tab identifies payments that have been posted against a credit card 
 balance and subsequently returned to the payment source. 
 H. AIRLINE 
 The Airline tab identifies airline ticket charges incurred on a credit card account and contains 
 information provided at the time of purchase, including the passenger's name, departure date, 
 origin airport, and destination airport. Connecting flight information, if applicable, is generally 
 available in the "Itinerary" column. 
 I. IP ADDRESS 
 The IP Address tab identifies intemet protocol address information captured by American 
 Express systems during online account activity (including some purchases, payments, and 
 account changes). If an e-mail was sent through the American Express website, the e-mail and 
 the IP address from which the customer logged in may have been captured. If a customer 
 purchased an item online using an American Express card and provided the merchant with an e-
 mail address as the point of contact, that address may also appear in this tab. 
 4) PREPAID CARD ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
 Every American Express prepaid card has a unique fifteen-digit number ("Card Number" or 
 "CM15"). Reloadable prepaid card products allow a cardholder to add funds to the account, and 
 some may be used to make ATM withdrawals, transfer money, and write checks. Prepaid card 
 products also include gift cards, which are predenominated and not reloadable. Some prepaid 
 products offer sub-accounts, which are established under the primarily, or "master" account for 
 another person age 13 or older. The sub-account is linked to, funded by, and controlled by the 
 master accountholder. 
 5) RELOADABLE PREPAID DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS) 
 For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on prepaid 
 members into several major categories: Demographic Information ("Demo"), Address, 
 Telephone, Peer to Peer Transactions ("P2P"), IP Address, Card Transactions, BillPay 
 Transactions, Airline Transactions, Funds Load, Withdrawals, Disputes, and Customer Service 
 Notes. 
 5/14/2019 AXP Restricted Page 3 of 9 
 EFTA00030209
The Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on other prepaid card members into several 
 major categories: Sale Info, Demographic Information ("Demo"), Redemptions ("OR REDE"), 
 Authorizations ("OR_AUTH"), Web Balance Inquiry ("OR_WEBBAL"), Direct Deposits, IVR 
 Inquiry, and Airlines. 
 This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets with each category occupying its 
 own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by labeled columns. If there is no 
 information to report in a particular category, the tab will either be blank or not appear on the 
 spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided below. 
 A. DEMO 
 The Demo tab for prepaid accounts associates an account with an individual, listing (where 
 available) their name, date of birth, social security number, and email address, as well as 
 information about the specific product, account status, and account type (Master, Sub, or 
 PurposeDriven (a savings account, which is linked to a master account)). 
 B. ADDRESS 
 The Address tab identifies all addresses that have been associated with each account, and 
 identifies the type of address (home, business, etc.). 
 C. TELEPHONE 
 The Telephone tab identifies all telephone numbers that have been associated with each account, 
 and identifies the type of number (Home, Mobile, Business, ANI, etc.). An ANI number is a 
 phone number from which the card member called an American Express customer service center. 
 The number is captured automatically and the date on which the call was made is provided. 
 D. P2P 
 The P2P tab provides information on all P2P transfers (transfers between prepaid accounts) sent 
 and received by a particular prepaid account, including account information for all senders and 
 recipients. 
 E. IP 
 The IP Address tab identifies intemet protocol address information captured by American 
 Express systems during online account activity. 
 F. CARD TRANSACTIONS 
 The Card Transactions tab provides information (amount, date, time, and location) on all 
 transactions conducted using a prepaid account, including purchases, refunds, and ATM 
 withdrawals. For purchases, the tab identifies the merchant where the card was redeemed. 
 G. BILLPAY TRANSACTIONS 
 The BillPay tab provides information on bills (e.g. credit cards, utilities, rent, etc.) paid by a 
 customer using their prepaid account, including the date, transaction amount, and payee name. 
 5/14/2019 AXP Restricted Page 4 of 9 
 EFTA00030210
H. AIRLINE TRANSACTIONS 
 The Airline tab identifies airline ticket charges and contains information provided at the time of 
 purchase relating to the departure date, originating airport, destination airport, and passenger 
 names. 
 I. FUNDS LOAD 
 The Funds Load tab provides information on when, where, and how a prepaid account was 
 funded (e.g. cash, direct deposit, credit/debit card load, etc.). Note — because in some instances 
 the data is maintained by a third party, some credits labeled "cash" may not actually have been 
 made via cash payment. For additional questions, please reach out to the Financial Intelligence 
 Unit. 
 J. WITHDRAWALS 
 The Withdrawals tab provides information on money withdrawn from a prepaid account via 
 check or ACH transfer, including the date, transaction amount, and transaction status, as well as 
 the bank name, account number, and routing number (where applicable). 
 K. DISPUTES 
 The Disputes tab includes information on transactions disputed by the prepaid accountholder, 
 including the dispute date, amount, reason, and resolution. 
 L. CUSTOMER SERVICE NOTES 
 The Customer Service Notes tab consists of notes recorded by customer service representatives, 
 and often includes information regarding customer phone calls, promotional offers, changes to 
 demographic information, and changes in account status. 
 6) PREPAID GIFT CARDS DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS) 
 A. DEMO 
 The Demo tab for prepaid gift cards associates a prepaid card with an individual, and may, in 
 limited circumstances, list their name, date of birth, social security number, address, phone 
 number, and email address, as well as information about the product type (e.g. reloadable or 
 single load) and the card status. 
 B. SALE INFO 
 The Sale Info tab explains when and where each prepaid card was purchased, as well the original 
 load value. 
 C. TRANSACTIONS 
 The Transactions tab identifies transactions conducted using a prepaid card, including purchases, 
 refunds, value loads, promotional credits, and maintenance fees. When money is added to a 
 prepaid card, the amount will appear under "redeem amount" as a negative number (for example, 
 a value load of $500.00 would be notated as -$500.00). 
 5/14/2019 AXP Restricted Page 5 of 9 
 EFTA00030211
D. AUTHORIZATIONS 
 The Authorizations tab identifies authorization requests submitted by prepaid cards, and whether 
 these requests were approved or denied (due to insufficient funds, for example). This tab also 
 identifies whether the payment attempt was made by swiping or keying the card (keying includes 
 intemet and phone charges). 
 E. DIRECT DEPOSIT 
 The Direct Deposit tab provides additional information regarding value loads to the account 
 made via direct deposit, including the business name and the employee name associated with the 
 deposit. 
 F. WEB BALANCE INQUIRY AND IVR INQUIRY 
 The Web Balance and IVR ("Interactive Voice Response") Inquiry tabs indicate when a 
 customer logs in online to review their account and when customer calls in to review their 
 account, respectively. 
 G. AIRLINES 
 The Airline tab identifies airline ticket charges and contains information provided at the time of 
 purchase relating to the departure date, originating airport, destination airport, and passenger 
 names. 
 7) AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
 Merchant accounts are established for businesses that accept American Express cards, and each 
 established merchant account is issued a unique ten-digit number ("merchant account number" or 
 "SE10"). Please note that "SE" is frequently used as a synonym for "merchant"; SE stands for 
 "Service Establishment." Merchant accounts are associated with an authorized signer and a 
 corresponding bank account. The authorized signer serves as the point of contact for the 
 merchant account, and that individual's identifying information is stored in internal American 
 Express systems, along with the bank account number provided to American Express at account 
 opening.' 
 8) MERCHANT DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS 
 For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on merchant 
 accounts into several major categories: Demographic Information ("SE Demo"), Record of 
 Charges ("SE ROC"), Authorization Request ("SE CAS"), Merchant Fraud ("SE Fraud"), 
 Merchant Billed ROC ("SE Billed Roc"), Merchant IP ("SE IP"), and Merchant Disputes ("SE 
 Disputes"). This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheet with each category 
 occupying its own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by labeled 
 columns. If there is no information to report in a particular category, then the tab will simply not 
 appear on the spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided 
 below. 
 I The availability of bank account information varies for international merchants. 
 5/14/2019 AXP Restricted Page 6 of 9 
 EFTA00030212
A. MERCHANT DEMO (SE DEMO) 
 The Merchant Demo tab lists the unique merchant account number, the legal name of the 
 business, as well as a Doing Business As name (where available). In cases where the merchant 
 relationship is not proprietary (i.e., a Seller or Location merchant), additional merchant data will 
 be provided in the tab. If the merchant is a Seller Merchant (that is, a third-party merchant 
 account that contracts with an "aggregator merchant" that contracts directly with American 
 Express to bring merchants to the American Express network), then "Seller" will appear under 
 the "Searched Merchant Type" field. If the merchant is a sub-merchant (i.e., acquired under a 
 third party payment processor such as Paypal or Square), then "Location" will appear under the 
 "Searched Merchant Type." The Merchant Demo tab also provides the reported address and 
 telephone number for the business, as well as the name and social security number of the 
 authorized signer(s) on the account. This tab further provides a correspondence address for the 
 business, a general industry description of the business, and an indication of whether the account 
 is open or closed.' Finally, the bank account number (if available based on merchant type) and 
 corresponding routing number for each merchant account is listed in the last column to the right 
 in the Merchant Demo tab of each spreadsheet. 
 B. MERCHANT ROC (SE ROC — RECORD OF CHARGES OR SPEND AT THE 
 MERCHANT) 
 The Merchant ROC ("Record of Charge") tab identifies all completed American Express charges 
 processed by the merchant. The tab identifies the timestamp and amount, in U.S. dollars as well 
 as the local amount (if outside of the U.S.) of each charge processed by the merchant. In 
 addition, the tab lists the card number and the name of the cardholder that made the purchase, as 
 well as some demographic information regarding that cardholder and card (including, but not 
 limited to, the cardholder's name, the card type and issuer). 
 C. MERCHANT AUTHORIZATION REQUEST (SE CAS) 
 This tab lists all credit authorizations sent by the merchant over the past two years. Every time a 
 card is swiped or keyed into a card reader, a request for credit is sent to American Express and an 
 approval code is returned. The request may be approved, denied, or pended. This tab identifies 
 whether the merchant processed the transaction by swiping or keying the card (keying includes 
 intemet and phone charges, while swiping typically indicates that the cardholder was physically 
 present at the merchant at the time of the transaction). 
 D. MERCHANT FRAUD (SE FRAUD) 
 This tab identifies all transactions processed by the merchant that were ultimately reported as 
 fraudulent by a respective American Express cardholder. 
 E. DISPUTES (SE DISPUTES) 
 The Disputes tab identifies all initiated charge disputes against a given merchant and the status of 
 individual disputes. 
 F. MERCHANT BILLED ROC (SE BILLED ROC) 
 2 In the case of Seller and Location merchants, the status information reflects that of the Submitting merchant, and 
 not the sub-merchants. 
 3 Bank account information is not available for Seller and Location merchants. 
 5/14/2019 AXP Restricted Page 7 of 9 
 EFTA00030213
The Merchant Billed ROC tab identifies all completed American Express charges processed by 
 the merchant over the past five years. The tab identifies the date and amount, in U.S. dollars, of 
 each charge processed by the merchant. In addition, the tab identifies the date and amount of the 
 transaction, the card number and the name of the cardholder that made the purchase, as well as 
 information regarding that cardholder (In the case of the merchant accounts pulled for the Texas 
 Attorney General's Office, please note that due to the size of some of the spreadsheets, the 
 BILLED ROC tab was not included. The majority of transactions will appear in the ROC tab). 
 G. IP ADDRESS (SE IP) 
 The IP tab identifies Internet protocol address information captured by American Express 
 systems during online account activity. 
 9) PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
 American Express National Bank issues High-Yield Savings accounts ("HYSAs") and 
 Certificates of Deposit ("CDs") to individuals. HYSAs and CDs are both referred to as Personal 
 Savings Accounts ("PSAs"). Every PSA has a unique ten-digit or twelve-digit account number 
 and may have up to two account holders — a primary account holder and a secondary account 
 holder. Each account holder has a unique customer identification number ("Customer ID") and 
 has equal access to the PSA. 
 10) PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET 
 TABSI 
 For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on PSA 
 account holders into several major categories: Demographic Information ("Demo"), Address,

 Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
 with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
 As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
 reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
 trauma or causing re-victimization. 
 As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
 U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
 U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
 spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
 been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
 Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
 believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
 hope to speak with her. 
 Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
 not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
 particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
 be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
 In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
 his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
 directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
 employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
 observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
 the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
 she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
 Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
 would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

 Hi 
 Hope you're doing well. In connection with the Epstein investigation, we were wondering if you could possibly send 
 us the search warrant affidavit and order for the Epstein residence. We understand that it was executed by local 
 authorities before the case was brought to the FBI, but we understand you have a copy in the files, and we can't seem 
 to locate it in the materials we've reviewed. If you could please email it to us, that would be a big help. 
 Thanks in advance for your help, we really appreciate it.

 Hey PCU — As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
 charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
 morning. 
 The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
 charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
 will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this unit 
 will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
 Please join me and in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, who 
 have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you are 
 free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
 morning at 11.

 Thank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. 
 Epstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish 
 residence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have a 
 new photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance at 
 my office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional questions or 
 concerns in this matter.

 Importance: Normal 
 ov't Says Epstein Victims Can't Scrap Nonprosecution Deal 
 By Carolina Bolado 
 Share us on: 
 Law360 (June 25, 2019, 4:07 PM EDT) -- Federal 
 prosecutors said Monday that billionaire sex offender 
 Jeffrey Epstein's victims are not entitled to the relief 
 they're seeking — namely the reopening of the 
 criminal case against Epstein and an apology — but 
 offered to participate in a hearing at which victims 
 can provide statements. 
 The government said the Crime Victims Rights Act, 
 under which two of Epstein's victims sued to 
 challenge the nonprosecution agreement, does not 
 provide for the relief they want, which includes a 
 detailed explanation from prosecutors about their 
 decision, an apology and monetary sanctions. 
 The court found in the victims' favor in February and 
 ruled that prosecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney 
 and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, 
 violated the CVRA when they signed the 
 nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without 
 notifying his victims. 
 In its response, the government admitted that it 
 should have communicated with the victims in a 
 more straightforward and transparent way but said 
 that does not mean the decision to not prosecute 
 Epstein was improper. The remedy should have a 
 https://www.law360.corniarticles/1172511/gov-t-says-
 epstein-victims-can-t-scrap-nonprosecution-deal 
 EFTA00030231
nexus to the purpose of the CVRA, which is to give 
 victims a voice but not to give them decision-making 
 authority over prosecutors, according to the 
 government. 
 "The past cannot be undone; the government 
 committed itself to the terms of the [nonprosecution 
 agreement], and the parties have not disputed that 
 Epstein complied with its provisions," the 
 government said. "A number of Epstein's victims 
 subsequently invoked the NPA to enter into civil 
 settlements with Epstein and, in that respect, also 
 relied on its terms. Any remedy for the CVRA 
 violation should thus serve to give the victims a 
 voice, even though the prosecution decision remains 
 out of their hands." 
 The government instead proposed a meeting with the 
 two plaintiffs, as well as any other Epstein victims 
 who want to attend, at which a U.S. Department of 
 Justice representative will discuss the government's 
 reasoning in resolving the Epstein case. 
 The government said prosecutors would also 
 participate in a public court proceeding at which any 
 Epstein victims can make statements. In addition, all 
 criminal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
 the Southern District of Florida would undergo 
 additional training on the CVRA and victim 
 assistance issues. 
 "While the court cannot unwind the past, the 
 remedies proposed by the government would give the 
 victims a meaningful opportunity to have their voices 
 heard and to understand, if not accept the decisions 
 made in this matter," the government said. 
 "Petitioners' requested remedies, on the other hand, 
 run afoul of the remedial scheme contemplated by the 
 EFTA00030232
CVRA, are contrary to law, and may cause 
 unintended harm to the victims whose interests are 
 also protected by the CVRA." 
 U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra granted 
 summary judgment in February to the two victims, 
 listed as Jane Does, who sued the government in 
 2008 alleging that prosecutors had violated the 
 CVRA with the Epstein deal. The judge said the 
 government's decision to hide its intentions and to 
 tell victims to just be patient with the investigation 
 was "particularly problematic." 
 Judge Marra rejected the government's claim that the 
 CVRA requires victims to be notified only of a plea 
 bargain or a deferred prosecution agreement, both of 
 which are more common than a nonprosecution 
 agreement. That reading of the law is "inconsistent 
 with the goal of the CVRA," according to the judge. 
 "The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to 
 only one interpretation; namely, that victims should 
 be notified of significant events resulting in 
 resolution of their case without a trial," Judge Marra 
 said. 
 The CVRA grants crime victims a number of rights, 
 including the right to be informed of public court 
 proceedings and not to be excluded from those 
 proceedings. The Miami Herald, in an investigative 
 report published late last year, printed emails 
 showing the alleged victims were deliberately 
 excluded from the deal cut between Acosta, who was 
 then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of 
 Florida, and Epstein's defense team. 
 Brad Edwards, who represents the victims, said his 
 clients are disappointed by the government's 
 EFTA00030233
response. 
 "After sifting through self-serving statistics and 
 variations of the same excuses we have heard for 
 years, the government took no responsibility for its 
 clear wrongdoing and suggests that no remedy is the 
 appropriate ruling," Edwards said. "In fact, it acts 
 like it is doing the victims a favor by offering to have 
 its attorneys voluntarily attend training courses. The 
 pleading was the type of slap in the face that we 
 expect to see from Mr. Epstein." 
 Epstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens

 Re: United States v. Jeffrey  Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
 Dear Judge Berman: 
 The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's Motion for 
 Pretrial Release (the "Release Motion"), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its 
 Memorandum in Support of Detention (the "Detention Memo"), submitted to Magistrate Judge 
 Pitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A). 
 Simply put, the Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant law, belittles 
 and smears the many dozens of victims of the defendant's appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails 
 to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will 
 reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
 Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks of releasing a defendant with extraordinary 
 financial resources, the defendant instead proposes a bail package that is effectively an unsecured 
 bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant's application and 
 order him detained pending trial. 
 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 The defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for 
 years. A grand jury has returned an indictment against him setting forth allegations that he abused 
 dozens of minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in multiple states. To this day, he is 
 designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, despite his attempts to 
 lower that classification. And any doubt that he is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated 
 when law enforcement agents discovered a trove of nude images of young girls in his Manhattan 
 mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime 
 involving a juvenile. 
 The defendant faces substantial evidence of guilt founded on the corroborated testimony 
 of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will be go to prison for 
 the rest of his natural life. He has at his disposal a vast fortune, nearly all of which remains

 concealed or obscured from the Court and the Government. The defendant also has a history of 
 obstruction and manipulation of witnesses, including as recently as when his offenses reemerged 
 in the media mere months ago. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the 
 gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and 
 casual disparagement of victims in his arguments. 
 Against this backdrop of significant—and fast-growing—evidence, serious charges, and 
 the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions that 
 are preposterously inadequate. While there are no conditions of bail that would reasonably assure 
 the defendant's presence in court proceedings or protect the safety of the community, as further 
 explained below, the defendant's proposal here is not a serious one. The defendant's Release 
 Motion sets forth a woefully inadequate bail package that, among other things, offers to pledge as 
 the only security against at least hundreds of millions of net worth a single property that has already 
 been designated by the Government for forfeiture and is therefore of no value whatsoever as 
 collateral. His proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable 
 would be little comfort to victims forced to wait additional months or years while the defendant is 
 located and returned to this country. The promise to "deregister or otherwise ground" his private 
 jet is meaningless given his wealth and ability to secure other means of travel, and the two 
 co-signers he proposes only reinforce his minimal community ties. Electronic monitoring would 
 merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing. And the private security force he proposes 
 to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar circumstances, simply 
 reinforced the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he can be secured at all 
 times: a federal correction center. 
 The defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended 
 detention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. The Court should order him detained. 
 BACKGROUND 
 A. Overview and Offense Conduct 
 As previously set forth, a federal grand July in this District returned an indictment (the 
 "Indictment") charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519, 
 and conspiracy to commit the same. The defendant argues that the Government "labels this a `Sex 
 Trafficking' case," as if the Government invented the term just for this defendant. Release Motion 
 at 2. In fact, the title of the statute for which a grand jury has found probable cause to believe the 
 defendant violated is: "Sex Trafficking of Children." 18 U.S.C. § 1591. 
 As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those charges involve a years-long 
 scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens 
 of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
 cash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the 
 defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual 
 in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect 
 contact with victims' genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant 
 EFTA00030248
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
 United States District Judge 
 July 12, 2019 
 Page 3 
 actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He 
 paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, 
 creating a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach. 
 The defendant keeps making clear the he does not understand the gravity of the offenses 
 with which he is charged, including his claim that he has "no criminal history"—other than a 
 conviction for engaging in sexual conduct with a minor, precisely the same kind of conduct alleged 
 here. And following that conviction, as described previously by the Government, the defendant 
 continued to maintain a vast trove of hundreds or thousands of nude photos of young subjects. The 
 defendant's victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young as 14 years old 
 when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including because victims told 
 him directly they were underage. And he abused these victims repeatedly—day after day, month 
 after month, year after year. 
 The defense calls these appalling acts "simple prostitution."' Mag. Tr. 12:12; see also 
 D. Tr. at 6:15-19 ("This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was 
 investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking"). That 
 offensive and horrible labeling of underage girls as prostitutes is unrecognized in federal law, 
 which criminalizes commercial sex acts with minors irrespective of the presence or absence of 
 force, fraud, or coercion. Defense counsel has already argued repeatedly that the Government's 
 case is infirm because no threats or coercion is alleged. Mag. Tr. at 12 ("There was no coercion. 
 There were no threats. There was no violence."), 17 ("there was no coercion. There was no 
 intimidation. There is no deception."); Release Motion at 2 ("There are no allegations ... that he 
 forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody ...."). 
 The most charitable explanation of this argument is that defense counsel may not yet realize 
 with which offense the defendant has been charged, wrongly believing it to be the provision of the 
 relevant statute that criminalizes recruitment or enticement of adults for commercial sex through 
 means of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. The prong under which the defendant is 
 charged, conversely, involves minors. As the indictment properly alleges, and the statute provides 
 for, where victims are underage, the Government principally must prove that a minor is caused to 
 engage in a commercial sex act. See United States v. Afrare, 632 F. App'x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 
 2016) ("We hold that § 1591(a) criminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than 18 years old) 
 with or without any force, fraud, or coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults 
 (18 or older), but only if done by force, fraud, or coercion."). 
 Here, incredibly, the defense has already effectively admitted that the Government will be 
 able to present evidence of these primary elements—that the defendant engaged in sex acts for 
 money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion at 2. If the defendant dislikes the 
 state of federal sex trafficking law, he may petition any of the nine members of Congress who 
 "Mag. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2019; 
 "D. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2019.

 represent his places of residence; meanwhile, in the case that has actually been brought, his 
 insistence that he is innocent of a crime with which he is not charged is irrelevant. 
 B. The Defendant 
 It might not occur to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant is widely reported 
 to be a billionaire—indeed, even the word "million" only appears once, to offer up as collateral a 
 property the Government has already noticed for seizure and forfeiture. Release Motion at 4. 
 Otherwise, there is not a single mention of net worth, income, or valuation of the defendant's vast 
 assets. This is, at best, obscurative. 
 Put plainly, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy. According to records from a financial 
 institution ("Institution-1") relating to the defendant, in or about 2017, the defendant's estimated 
 net worth was listed as "$500 MM +" and his estimated annual income was $10 million. According 
 to records from another financial institution ("Institution-2") relating to the defendant, from 2018 
 through the present, the defendant's personal and business accounts have spent more than $10 
 million on credit cards alone. 
 The defendant has six residences, a private jet, an estimated net worth of at least a half a 
 billion dollars. His extraordinary incentives to flee, as further discussed below, are equaled by his 
 means to do so. 
 ARGUMENT 
 The Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be detained 
 pending trial. He is a tremendous risk of flight, and a danger to the community, and he cannot 
 overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. 
 I. The Defendant's Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk 
 Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances 
 of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
 counsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do nothing 
 whatsoever to mitigate that risk. 
 A. The Defendant's Financial Resources 
 As set forth in the Government's Detention Memo, the nature and circumstances of this 
 offense and the strength of the evidence create an extraordinary risk of flight. The defendant faces 
 up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which he is charged, and the possibility 
 of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. 
 Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987). 
 And the evidence of his guilt, already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was 
 unsealed, is growing stronger literally by the day. Several additional women have identified 
 themselves to the Government as victims of the defendant. Pursuant to judicially-authorized 
 EFTA00030250
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
 United States District Judge 
 July 12, 2019 
 Page 5 
 search warrants, the Government has discovered and seized vast amounts of photographs of nude 
 and seminude young women and girls in the defendant's Manhattan residence, and is in the process 
 of reviewing dozens of electronic discs that contain still more such photos. And dozens of 
 individuals have called the Government to convey information regarding the defendant and his 
 conduct. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that already alleges 
 dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida. 
 Faced with significant and mounting evidence, the defendant's Release Motion does not 
 even attempt to account for the numerous entities, accounts, and assets he controls in the United 
 States and abroad. The Court cannot begin to evaluate the defendant's net worth, much less be 
 aware of particular obscured, hidden, or foreign-based assets that would further demonstrate the 
 defendant's ability to finance a comfortable life beyond the reach of United States authorities. The 
 defendant's financial resources are indisputably a relevant aspect of his "history and 
 characteristics." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(3); See United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 795 (1st 
 Cir. 1991) (explaining that a district court should consider the extent of a defendant's assets and 
 net worth before determining the amount of property to be posted as forfeiture condition). 
 In the first instance, because the defendant has refused to fill out a financial affidavit in 
 connection with his application for bail, the Court simply does not have sufficient information to 
 properly and accurately evaluate the defendant's risk of flight. Although the defendant continues 
 to hide the true scope, nature, and amount of his assets, he has repeatedly been described as a 
 billionaire in press reports, and is identified in documents of his own financial institution as having 
 a net worth of $500 million or more. 
 As described in the Government's Detention Memo, these resources, which remain 
 unknown in scope and would be completely unfettered by the defendant's proposed bail package, 
 give the defendant access to innumerable means to flee. The defendant is a frequent traveler and 
 regularly travels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 20 flights in 
 which he traveled to or from a foreign country since 2018. Extensive international travel of this 
 nature further demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 
 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). 
 And not only does the defendant have the means to flee thanks to his vast wealth, crucially, 
 even were he to sacrifice literally all of his current assets, there is every indication that he would 
 immediately be able to resume making millions or tens of millions of dollars per year outside of 
 the United States. He already earns an estimated $10,000,000 per year, according to records from 
 Institution -1, while living in the U.S. Virgin Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in 
 part in Paris, France; there would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his 
 unknown assets abroad, and resuming whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a 
 computer terminal beyond the reach of extradition. 
 The defendant is in a position to abandon millions of dollars in cash and property securing 
 any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of his life. These resources, and the ease 
 with which the defendant could flee and live outside the reach of law enforcement make the risk 
 of flight unacceptably high.

 United States District Judge

 B. The Defendant's Promise of "Consent" to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical 
 The theoretical possibility of extradition does not support release, because extradition is 
 never guaranteed, and rather is typically lengthy, complicated, and expensive. Additionally, the 
 defendant's offer to sign a so-called "consent" to extradition provides no additional reassurance 
 whatsoever. Numerous courts have recognized that such purported waivers are unenforceable and 
 effectively meaningless. See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, 
 at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at 
 *3 (D. Or. Aug. 3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, 
 at *7 (D. Utah Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 
 n. I I (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 
 2004); United States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); 
 United States v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. Fla. 1985). This is for very good reason: 
 Any defendant who signs such a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity 
 and/or voluntariness of the waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the 
 one to which he chose to flee). The Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs is 
 unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an anticipatory extradition 
 waiver binding. 
 C. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance 
 The defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the 
 Court. In particular, the defendant's endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio 
 frequency bracelet is farcical—neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed. At 
 best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would merely reduce his head start should he 
 decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 
 Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because home 
 detention with electronic monitoring "at best ... limits a fleeing defendant's head start"); see also 
 United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); 
 United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, 
 No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
 D. Private Security is Inadequate and Raises Numerous Questions and Challenges 
 The defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from 
 court under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected. 
 At the outset, it is far from clear that the defendant's private jail proposal, which seeks to 
 replicate the conditions of a government-run detention facility in the defendant's home, is a 
 condition of "release" that implicates the Bail Reform Act. "[T]here is a debate within the 
 judiciary over whether a defendant, if she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her own 
 home at her own cost, has a right to do so under the Bail Reform Act and the United States 
 Constitution." United States v. Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Bianco, J.) 
 (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never directly addressed this issue. See United States 
 v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.18 (2d Cir. 2007) ("The government has not argued and, therefore, 
 EFTA00030252
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
 United States District Judge 
 July 12, 2019 
 Page 7 
 we have no occasion to consider whether it would be `contrary to the principles of detention and 
 release on bail' to allow wealthy defendants `to buy their way out by constructing a private jail." 
 (citations omitted)). While "troubled by [the] possibility" of wealthy defendants being allowed to 
 construct a private jail, the Second Circuit has not yet had occasion to decide whether district 
 courts "routinely must consider the retention of self-paid private security guards as an acceptable 
 condition of release before ordering detention." United States v. Banki, 369 Fed. App'x 152, 
 153-54 (2d Cir. 2010) (unpublished); see Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (noting that the Bail 
 Reform Act addresses solely "conditions of release, not conditions of detention"). Indeed, a 
 decision by this Court reasoned that "the very severe restrictions" in the private jail proposal 
 presented to him did "not appear to contemplate `release' so much as it describes a very expensive 
 form of private jail or detention." United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. 
 June 16, 2016). 
 Courts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant's which, "at 
 best `elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility 
 instills."' United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Gotti, 
 776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F. 
 Supp. 3d at 295 ("The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use 
 force against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether 
 the guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the 
 imperfections -of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more 
 secure option of an actual jail."). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled 
 environment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner 
 can be attended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant's proposed 
 private jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-
 fl ight -risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape attempt while in the community and involving 
 armed private guards attempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—rather than the 
 defendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the 
 defendant's flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 
 2019) (in rejecting a private jail proposal, noting that it "raise[d] several issues related to use of 
 force" including that any escape attempt would "present the risk of a confrontation of armed guards 
 and Defendant . . . in the streets of New York city, which would mean that any reduction in the 
 Defendant's flight risk from this proposal would be at least partially offset by a greater risk to the 
 community") (citation omitted). "This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal 
 prisoners should be detained in facilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional 
 facilities." Id. at 258 (citing Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 74 n.13 ("To the extent [armed private guards] 
 implies an expectation that deadly force may need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at 
 trial... [s]uch a conclusion would, in fact, demand a defendant's detention")). 
 In Banki, the Second Circuit has held that it is not legal error "for a district court to decline 
 to accept," as "a substitute for detention," a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor 
 him. 369 F. App'x at 154. In the same decision, the Second Circuit noted that it was "troubled" 
 by the possibility of "allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy their way out by constructing a private 
 jail." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accord, e.g., United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 
 EFTA00030253
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
 United States District Judge 
 July 12, 2019 
 Page 8 
 (WHP), 2013 WL 3802012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) ("It is contrary to underlying 
 principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should 
 be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained 
 or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully selected'" (quoting Borodin v. 
 Ashcroft, 136 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 
 2014) ("There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would suggest that a defendant (or even, 
 hypothetically, a group of defendants with private finding) has a statutory right to replicate or 
 construct a private jail in a home or some other location."). 
 The defendant's payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having 
 the defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding 
 him, leaving the company's incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani, 
 356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the 
 appearance of a defendant, noting a "clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an 
 inmate" and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant 
 "was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was vitited by a masseuse for a 
 total of 160 hours in a 30-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in 
 Chinatown with his private guards in tow"); see also United States v. Tajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018 
 WL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2018) (Finding Zarrab "particularly instructive" and 
 further noting: "While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the 
 defendant's security detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in 
 fl eeing the Court's jurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the power of money and its potential 
 to corrupt or undermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's 
 ruling, they also cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored."). 
 Finally, in Zarrab this Court found that "the Defendant's privately funded armed guard 
 proposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a 
 very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab." 2016 
 WL 3681423, at *13; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 ("although this Defendant has vast 
 financial resources to construct his own 'private prison,' the Court is not convinced 'disparate 
 treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act"') (quoting United States v. 
 Bruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) ("Even if Defendant had the financial capacity 
 to replicate a private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of 
 conditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant, 
 or that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.")); Borodin, 
 136 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (Nickerson, J.) ("It is contrary to underlying principles of 
 detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy 
 their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately 
 accountable to the government, even if carefully selected."). 
 The defendant's appearance can only be assured through detention— not through bail 
 granted based on hollow promises of an intent to clear his name in the face of weighty evidence 
 and a sentence of up to 45 years in jail, not through release on the threat of forfeiture of a mere 
 fraction of his wealth and property should he flee, and not through "detention" under the guard of 
 individuals to be paid by the defendant himself. Indeed: "What more compelling case for an order 
 EFTA00030254

 United States District Judge 
 July 12, 2019 
 Page 9 
 of detention is there than a case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is 
 sufficient to assure the defendant's appearance?" Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681432, at *12 
 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 295).

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful that 
 your client is open to speaking with us. 
 On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and your 
 client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done with you 
 (and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our ability, and 
 then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
 Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include individuals 
 in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is providing 
 support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness wants to speak 
 with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his capacity as an 
 attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just want to 
 confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to pay for 
 third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we certainly 
 could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it easier for the 
 friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful — I'll be at my 
 desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at or we could also set a time to chat, whatever 
 would be helpful. 
 thank you,

 Hello
 Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
 • That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
 involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist.

 Louise Scott c
 • In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
 • That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need to 
 be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
 Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible?

 Hi, 
 Thanks so much for your email. Fully agree --Jenna is the best. This is for an attorney proffer and if possible, Jenna will 
 probably join us. 
 I'm not sure whether legally changed her name, or if I was just given her husband's last name

 That's great, thanks — and Jenna is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our scheduling, I 
 take it we'll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we're talking about a meeting with the 
 client. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I'll circle back in timing, and will also send you a 
 copy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with her this afternoon. 
 Two other quick things — first, we know your client as but I think you mentioned her name has changed? 
 Could you please let me know her current last name? 
 And second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or anyone 
 associated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection with him. 
 Primarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it's something we don't need to talk to her 
 directly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at this stage, no problem at all, 
 we can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it.

Hi there, 
 Sorry for the delay on our end. Robbie is going to be out of town, but Alex Hess (cc'd here) and I, and our colleague Jenna 
 Dabbs (former member of your office), would love to do a proffer with you tomorrow or Friday. We can do it by phone or 
 in person, but would prefer to do it in person. 
 On Thursday, we are available from 9 to 11AM or after 4PM. On Friday, we are available any time after 11AM. 
 What works best for you? 
 Thanks!

 Following up on our Brass meeting just now, It's that time of year when we need to do forfeiture funding requests. 
 These are basically short write-ups of cases that may involve forfeiture and are also likely to incur significant 
 investigative costs (e.g., traveling to Florida a dozen times, hiring a vendor retaining an expert). Could you guys do a 
 super quick Epstein write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today — sorry 
 for the short notice)? I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). 
 Also, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC — please send it back to me.

 Hi all, 
 As you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has 
 the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving 
 release. Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's 
 rights —under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a 
 submission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no 
 requirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. 
 To the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that while I don't want to prejudge the 
 Would it make sense to set up a brief call sometime tomorrow, if any of you want to discuss? I should be able to make 
 myself available whenever is convenient for you (and likely will be just me, as the remainder of the team will be traveling).

we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is no 
 problem at all. 
 In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
 explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
 comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
 talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
 anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are able 
 to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
 approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
 were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
 victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
 topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
 always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
 In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
 that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
 the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
 discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
 and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
 particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
 you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could facilitate 
 that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure you that 
 every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive experience more 
 generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how we have been able 
 to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely would take the same 
 sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who have spoken with us. 
 Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how our 
 process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that with no 
 obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could just address 
 the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue to appreciate 
 your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
 thank you very much,

 out because I believe you are handling the Epstein case and that Berman is assigned. I assume you all know this, 
 but Judge Berman had the Cameron Douglas case, which I handed with Jeff Brown at the time, and Cameron 
 Douglas was granted bail with various requirements that he reside in his NY apartment with 24 hr surveillance 
 paid for by him etc. He ultimately violated those conditions by smuggling drugs via an electric toothbrush. 
 Berman is obviously well aware of the situation and it could be a helpful data point for you all if you don't 
 already know about it (not sure anyone is left with the institutional knowledge of that case).

only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
 country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
 believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
 useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
 the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're 
 of course happy to travel to her.) 
 Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
 working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
 generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
 those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I 
 can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
 With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
 investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
 witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
 change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
 been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
 course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
 follow-up via email.

 Hi= 
 Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
 notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
 As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
 provide any comfort on this? 
 Many thanks

 Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
 with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
 As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
 reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
 trauma or causing re-victimization. 
 As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
 U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
 U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
 spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
 been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
 Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
 believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
 hope to speak with her. 
 Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
 not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
 particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
 be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
 In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
 his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
 directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
 employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
 observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
 the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
 she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
 Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
 would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

 Hey =, 
 So far so good here, thanks — just trying to deal with the tech issues of working from home (not to mention the inability to 
 interview witnesses!) but really can't complain at all, the girlfriend and I are both healthy and distancing. Hope that's true 
 for you and yours too. 
 In terms of the issues below, unfortunately there isn't any progress — it's not a delay on our end, we've run the taint 
 screen and so the AUSAs and agents all have access on Relativity to the materials that sent over in December. We 
 also sent the privilege taint terms to the agents a couple weeks ago so they could run the screen on whatever programs 
 they may be using — that's attached. We hadn't realized that they were impeded on their review due to any taint issue, 
 we just thought they were using Relativity, same as us. 
 More generally though, the issue we continue to have is the same one since February. We have absolutely no sense of 
 what sent to us — it's not organized or identified by device or even by location, the documents aren't joined with 
 their attachments (their "families" in the terms of doc review), we can't look at native files, etc. It's all the issues from my 
 March 9 email, below, which never responded to. And it's only 1.4 million documents out of what are presumably 
 tens of millions total — we haven't gotten any version of the rest (and don't know exactly what we're missing, because 
 again, we have no way to track what we've been given so far). 
 If (and/or others at CART) are teleworking, it would be great to get help on this, because obviously weeks are going 
 by that we could be using to review. I had been trying to push my chiefs for a meeting in early March but then obviously 
 the world imploded! So not sure what can be done currently, but happy to discuss with anybody that would be useful. 
 thanks as always,

 = totally happy to chat, and it's exactly the same issues as we talked about on the phone a couple weeks ago when 
 we first raised this -- I wonder if it makes sense to get in a room together? Otherwise it's a lot of games of telephone. 
 But basically the way to think about it is, imagine if we had seized papers from approximately 100,000 filings cabinets in 
 a dozen different office buildings. And then instead of keeping them organized or labeled by room, or even by office 
 building, all 1.3 million documents (so far) just got dumped into one big pile — except before that, any documents that 
 had multiple parts stapled together got separated. And then if any of those documents that was larger than about 100 
 pages couldn't be opened. That's what we've got, just electronically.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
 The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
 sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 16 or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
 mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring 
 to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just 
 partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only 
 is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 - The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
 the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
 effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
 numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
 large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
 get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
 million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
 record -keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
 attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
 that's useful.

 Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
 of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
 the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
 Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 EFTA00030311
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
 tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
 Spreadsheet is attached.

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
 two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
 and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
 attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
 transferred, and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think 
 FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
 be able to review them as well.)

 Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
 we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
 local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that 
 all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from 
 NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be 
 produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been 
 produced. Still working on the rest.

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
 EFTA00030313
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
 etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
 approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
 counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
 including multiple servers / server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of 
 time to schedule a productive meeting.

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
 the hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
 old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
 new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
 modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
 haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
 "NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
 That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
 or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in 
 addition to what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really 
 need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same 
 info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool

 Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
 have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
 what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
 search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
 transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
 mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
 and received so far, and what remains. 
 (Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
 was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
 able to review them as well.)

 Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
 to schedule a productive meeting.

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
 modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
 to schedule a productive meeting. 
 thanks all,

 Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
 ss 
 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
 EFTA00030333
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 No problem! Good luck with everything. I don't think there's any hard deadline on the request because we're not in court 
 and they didn't send a subpoena. So the main constraint is Glassman's annoyance. I wrote him a brief note back last night, 
 although I doubt that will keep him happy for very long. I try not to provide specific timelines on stuff like this, but if we 
 need too much more time I can try letting him know a more specific sense of timing. Thanks!

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust.

All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 EFTA00030348

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 EFTA00030353
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 EFTA00030354
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent

 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 EFTA00030362
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to

 GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
 CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
 Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
 Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
 Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
 Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
 Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
 announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00030364
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present.

 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of

 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew

 to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
 conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
 unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
 Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
 purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
 EFTA00030374
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
 including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
 statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
 court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
 Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
 participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
 delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
 All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
 Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
 FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
 most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
 law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
 behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
 justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
 example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
 and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
 exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
 subjected." 
 NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
 be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
 partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
 If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
 the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
 According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
 From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
 in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
 ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
 young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
 that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
 MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
 which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
 MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
 taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
 victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
 ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
 Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
 financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
 normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
 Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
 As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
 susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
 minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
 was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
 during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
 involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
 EFTA00030375
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
 of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
 touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
 Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
 well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
 Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
 false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
 sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
 travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
 transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
 activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
 carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
 purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
 Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
 This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
 and are in charge of the prosecution. 
 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
 unless and until proven guilty.

 Apologies all, I just saw these emails. We are not providing weekend calls generally at this time, and counsel has been 
 having 2 hour legal calls every afternoon in addition to the standing call set up in the morning. This is far more than 
 almost every other inmate receives prior to an arraignment. Most other arraignments have been set up with one or two 
 days notice, with only one call to counsel and one call to pretrial services. 
 I have received no calls or emails from counsel, so I'm not sure where they have made these emergency requests. 
 They will have another call with her tomorrow, and I can let staff know they will request the call on Tuesday as well. 
 >> >' " < > 7/12/2020 12:42 PM >>> 
 Following up, we heard from defense counsel that they didn't receive a call this morning either and that they filed an 
 emergency request but haven't heard back. Please let us know the status as soon as possible? They also wanted to 
 confirm that they will have calls at 10:00 tomorrow and Tuesday. Again, we realize this is unusual but Fm not aware of 
 any other defendants who are in this circumstance of having a bail hearing pending in just two days. Also copying 
 in case he's aware of someone else we should contact.

 One of Maxwell's attorneys sent the below email. I've attached the Friday ruling that he is referring to which is not a bail 
 order and instead relates to the conditions of confinement. As you know, he already appealed Judge Nathan's prior bail 
 orders. (After he filed the bail appeal in the Circuit, Judge Nathan subsequently denied the defense's request for a 
 renewed bail hearing). Does he need to file a new appeal? It's not clear to us what he is doing here. Happy to give you a 
 call to discuss.

 Defense counsel for Maxwell communicated to us a few minutes ago that they haven't gotten a call yet this 
 morning. Do you know if that has gone through in the past five or ten minutes? They are looking to speak with 
 her before her interview with pretrial this afternoon. 
 I'm reachable at if it's useful to chat in real time.

 You're welcome. We will do our best to provide a call at 10:00 AM every day this week to Mr. Everdell

 The EDNY and SDNY created a joint protocol whereby counsel may request legal calls to be placed in 
 the afternoon at the MDC. Requests should be sent to 
 Truly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline, 
 counsel really should send the requests to the federal defenders, as outlined in the protocol. We want to 
 ensure inmates get equitable access. If they anticipate needing several calls in a week, they should 
 make requests in advance and note whether and when calls would be preferred. Generally, calls are for 
 30 minutes in duration. If a longer call is desired, that should be explained as well. 
 If you need anything else, please let me know.

 Thank you so much, 
 A 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's 
 something you would be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are 
 very grateful for the time. 
 We have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' 
 counsel following the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense 
 counsel thus far. There appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule 
 legal calls. Would you be able to please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can 
 make sure they understand what steps to take going forward? 
 Thank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it. 
 Best,

 You're welcome. 
 Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good 
 idea), in advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to 
 follow the same protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. 
 I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were 
 able to facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, 
 about mid-day, that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as 
 defense counsel having difficulty scheduling legal calls. 
 Thank you,

 Thanks, This is about the legal call today. In addition, because defense counsel his having difficulty 
 scheduling legal calls, it would be helpful if MDC could schedule standing calls for the rest of this week to 
 address this issue. Thanks very much.

 Hi 
 Hope you're doing well. This evening, Judge Nathan directed the parties in the US v. Ghislaine Maxwell case to 
 file a letter by 9pm today. Defense counsel need to speak with Ms. Maxwell this evening about the letter, but 
 they have not been able to reach her. Would it be possible to allow Ms. Maxwell to make a legal call to her 
 lawyers this evening, please? 
 Thank you very much for your help.

 Everything with the exception of a couple of items are ready. I will get you an actual number before I send it over. 
 We can send it over tomorrow. There will be ReadMe files included so it will be easy to see where the items came from. I 
 am a little worried about how the e-mail will present. While looking through on a spot check, the attachments are not 
 connected to the e-mails in the forensic tool. I believe it is a function of the e-mail client they were using to begin with. I 
 know that the attachments are a concern of yours. We may have to massage things a bit to get it right. Now that we are 
 working every day, and everything has been processed, it shouldn't be too big a deal. So far the export is about 350 GB. It 
 copies slowly because it is a ton of pretty small files. You are getting the whole ball of wax, here, Macs, Windows boxes, 
 loose media, etc. There will be a few iPhone and iPad reports, but unsure if I can get you those tomorrow as they very 
 often take a LONG time to copy. Again, lots of small files. If not tomorrow, the next day. 
 Are you around tomorrow? Reach out to me when you get the production so we can correct any problems we might 
 encounter. Thanks.

 I understand that some number of the devices are ready to come to us as early as today or tomorrow. Could you please 
 let us know the following information, so we can figure out who the hard drive should go to in the first instance: 
 1. How many total devices are coming to us in this initial production? 
 1. What are those devices — i.e., type of device and which ones, from the spreadsheets you've sent? 
 2. What's the total volume of data coming in this round of production? 
 Once we know that, I can let the agents know where the drive needs to go in the first instance.

 You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

 I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
 discussions with . Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
 particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
 drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
 everything is complete.

 Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
 we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
 is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
 The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
 The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
 EFTA00030399
the following loose storage devices: 
 o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
 o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
 o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
 o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
 o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
 The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
 The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
 The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
 I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
 spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
 The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
 list also has — is that info available? 
 The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
 all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to

 Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
 unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
 convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
 size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
 file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
 in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
 iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
 get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

 Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
 such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
 tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
 we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
 I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from is that the best 
 way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
 I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
 taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
 And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
 this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
 understand from that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
 understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to understand the 
 approach, as well as the timeline.

 Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
 that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
 taint review. 
 Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
 computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
 you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
 already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
 and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
 Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
 evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
 gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
 by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
 you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
 methodology I suppose. 
 EFTA00030401
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
 attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
 back was lacking.

 Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
 sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
 regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
 means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
 ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

 Like said in his earlier email. It will be the raw data and it will be marked so it is easier to attribute it to a

 In terms of data transfer, are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
 our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
 processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
 make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

 Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
 excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
 "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
 "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
 For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
 We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
 recently received: 
 The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
 attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
 that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
 counsel. 
 The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
 native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
 means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
 Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
 and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
 native files, it would be impossible. 
 EFTA00030406
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
 a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
 documents without much rhyme or reason. 
 I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
 keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
 returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

 Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
 clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
 (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
 loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
 I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
 they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
 Spreadsheet is attached.

 Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is

 Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
 delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
 work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
 windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
 only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
 far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working

 Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
 sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
 which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
 materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
 devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
 Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
 CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
 server racks. 
 So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
 pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
 Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time

 I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
 hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
 materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
 EFTA00030409
Just generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
 we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
 which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
 So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
 date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
 any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
 modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
 more than 600,000 items. 
 I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
 file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
 what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
 spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
 which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
 organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
 We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

 Sorry but I don't believe this voucher is accurate, similar to the prior one. First, it appears to allocate one night of the 
 hotel to the travel card, which is incorrect—the entirety of the hotel was paid on my personal card (please see attached 
 email and I'm again sending the hotel invoice). Additionally, it doesn't appear to include the hotel tax of $ 70.12, which I 
 also paid on my personal credit card. 
 Please let me know when it's corrected and I'll review again. Thanks.

 Following up on my trip to California last week, I've just dropped off receipts for expenses, including the hotel invoice and 
 three taxi receipts for airport trips. Please note that because I unfortunately forgot my work card ALL the charges are to 
 my personal credit card. It's five receipts total, which are: 
 1) 11/13, taxi to JFK Airport, $ 59.33 (Uber, personal credit card) 
 2) 11/13, taxi from airport to hotel, $ 56.46 (taxi, personal credit card)

 I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell 
 released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her 
 greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested 
 because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate 
 safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is 
 getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)

Independent 
 Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
 PROTOCOL 
 DRAFT 1
 December 13, 2019 
 I. Purpose and Overview 
 The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") is a voluntary, independent Program that 
 has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims/survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey 
 Epstein ("Epstein"). 
 The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Estate") has retained the services of nationally recognized claims 
 administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the 
 Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the "Administrator"). 
 Through the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims/survivors and 
 offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse. 
 The Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
 • The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a victim may have 
 unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
 Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop participating 
 in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release. 
 • The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or 
 overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to 
 the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the Program. 
 The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to determine 
 Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. Decisions of 
 the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to review or 
 modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity. 
 • There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to 
 compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to 
 each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the 
 Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive discretion, 
 issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation. 
 ' This document is a draft of the Protocol governing the Program and is subject to input from victims/survivors, their lawyers, 
 other potentially interested parties, and representatives of the Estate. 
 Wage 
 EFTA00030441
• All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to race, 
 color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To ensure 
 claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process so that 
 all Claimants can equally access the Program's claim process. Individuals with 
 disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their claims and 
 to request special process accommodations. 
 The Program will be effective within 90 days of approval by the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands 
 ("Effective Date")2 and is available to all victims/survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when 
 they were harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether 
 they have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. 
 The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
 determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date ("Filing Deadline"). All 
 individual claims filed with the Program must be postmarked within this period. 
 II. Eligibility Requirements 
 A. Eligibility Criteria 
 The persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused 
 by Epstein. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
 • The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein. 
 • An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may participate 
 in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met. 
 • An individual who previously entered into a settlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual 
 abuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are 
 met. 
 • An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims/survivors may participate 
 in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual acted under 
 duress as a result of her own sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other eligibility criteria are 
 met. 
 • If the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with 
 prejudice any existing lawsuits or legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities 
 and/or individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or prior to the 
 signed acceptance letter and executed Release in order to receive payment. 
 2 The final version of the Protocol will include dates certain identifying the commencement date of the Program and 
 registration and filing deadlines, as explained below. 
 Wage 
 EFTA00030442
B. Legal Representatives of Claimants 
 An individual may file a claim on a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority 
 to act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The "Legal Representative" of an 
 individual Claimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal 
 guardian authorized by law to serve as the minor's legal representative; (2) in the case of an incompetent 
 or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's legal 
 representative in accordance with applicable law; or (3) an attorney authorized to represent the Claimant 
 for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program. 
 Legal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such 
 proof may include a power of attorney, documentation showing the individual's appointment as guardian 
 or guardian ad litem, or a copy of a retainer agreement showing legal representation signed by both the 
 Claimant and the attorney. 
 Claims Administration - Submission, Evaluation and Determination 
 A. Claims Submission Process 
 Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate on or before 
 the Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including 
 Instructions for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. 
 Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate on or 
 before the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at 
 www.EpsteinVictimsCompensationProgram.com. 3 To register, such individuals must complete a 
 questionnaire setting forth their name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the 
 claim and other requested information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary 
 review to consider if the individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems 
 that the individual is eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form 
 and other relevant Program information. 
 Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates 
 that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It 
 does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive 
 compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has 
 been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. 
 Registrations will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective Date through a date that is 45 days 
 prior to the Filing Deadline ("Registration Deadline"). It is important to note that the Registration Deadline 
 is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained above, all claims must be filed by the 
 Filing Deadline. 
 This website is in the process of being developed and is yet operational. 
 Wage 
 EFTA00030443
All Claim Forms must be completed and postmarked no later than the Filing Deadline. Claim Forms 
 should be mailed via overnight courier (a pre-paid courier voucher will be included with each packet) to 
 the Administrator at the following address or uploaded to the Program website at 
 www.EosteinVictimsCompensationProgram.com:
 Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
 00 Jordana H. Feldman, Administrator 
 [Address - To Be Inserted] 
 Claimants are invited to provide documentation identified in the Claim Form, and any other corroborating 
 or supporting information sufficient to substantiate the claim, satisfy eligibility requirements, and allow 
 the Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. If the claim is being presented by a Legal 
 Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for submitting the necessary 
 documentation relating to the represented Claimant. 
 Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant 
 and the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed 
 relevant to the Administrator's evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator's final 
 disposition of the claim. 
 If a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant, explain 
 the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant's Legal 
 Representative (where applicable) to assist in submitting a complete claim. 
 B. Claims Evaluation and Determination 
 Claims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each 
 submitted individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all required 
 documentation has been submitted to the Administrator 
 1. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims 
 As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
 information available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will 
 consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
 • The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the nature 
 and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the age of 
 the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include (i) 
 medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and 
 (ii) contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the 
 abuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others. 
 • Whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate 
 Office of the District Attorney or other law enforcement agency. 
 4IPage 
 EFTA00030444
• Whether the Administrator finds the claims of the individual to be credible after complete review 
 of all relevant documentation and other evidence provided by the Claimant and the Estate. 
 As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
 information available, the amount of compensation that should be offered to each eligible Claimant. The 
 Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
 • The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the Claimant. 
 • The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse. 
 • The nature and extent of the Claimant's physical or psychological damage resulting from the 
 sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual abuse on the Claimant. 
 • The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and circumstances, supporting 
 documentation and corroborating evidence. 
 • Whether the claim is time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations. 
 • Whether the Claimant previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and received 
 a payment pursuant to such agreement. 
 The Administrator will confidentially send the Claimant a compensation determination letter including the 
 following: (1) the Administrator's eligibility decision regarding the claim; (2) the amount of compensation 
 offered; (3) a Release to be signed by the Claimant if the Claimant accepts the offered compensation; and 
 (4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer shall be valid for 60 days from the date of the 
 compensation determination letter. 
 The Administrator's determinations in this Program will not be binding on any potential criminal 
 investigation involving the same or similar allegations or Claimant. 
 2. Opportunities to be Heard 
 The Claimant will be afforded an opportunity to be heard, either before or after the Administrator renders 
 her determination. Upon request by the Claimant, the Administrator will be available to meet in person, 
 by video conference/Skype, or by teleconference to further discuss the claim. These meetings are 
 completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet with the Administrator should be sent by email 
 claimantservices@epsteinvictimscompensationprogram.com 4 and will be scheduled at a mutually 
 convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting with a Claimant or her Legal 
 Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location, though the Claimant is not 
 obligated to attend any such meeting. 
 4 This email address is not yet active. 
 5IPage 
 EFTA00030445
3. Release 
 By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations of 
 sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, related entities and/or individuals. If a Claimant chooses 
 to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the Claimant will be required to sign and 
 execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all past and future claims relating to such 
 allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or individuals. A Claimant may reject 
 the offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time 
 prior to the execution of the Release. 
 The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries 
 may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities 
 and/or individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to participate in any 
 legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However, the Release will not 
 operate to preclude or limit the Claimant's ability to report and discuss allegations of sexual abuse with 
 law enforcement officials or anyone else. 
 Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney. If the Claimant is not represented 
 by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal counseling to the Claimant 
 for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and binding nature of the 
 Release. 
 No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under 
 the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding tax 
 liability for payments pursuant to the Program. 
 4. Payments 
 Upon the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's receipt of 
 the Claimant's executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing lawsuit 
 or legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or individuals, the Administrator will 
 initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as directed by the 
 Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. 
 C. Program Integrity 
 For the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible 
 Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent 
 claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies, irregularities 
 or duplication. 
 6IPage 
 EFTA00030446
Each Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information provided 
 in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the Claimant 
 understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may result in fines, 
 imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be potentially fraudulent 
 or to contain false information will be forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies 
 and/or the appropriate Office of the District Attorney for possible investigation and prosecution. 
 D. Confidentiality/Privacy 
 The Program is confidential. By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal 
 Representative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by the Claimant pursuant to the 
 Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the following 
 purposes: 
 I) Processing and evaluating the Claimant's claim; 
 2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and 
 3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate. 
 When documents maintained or submitted by the Estate become part of a Claimant's file for purposes 
 of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to assist in processing and 
 evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. These files are not available for inspection, 
 review or copying by the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent 
 settlement privileges and other privileges apply. 
 To protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by 
 the Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of 
 the Program. 
 Individual Claimants are not bound by any rules of confidentiality. Claimants may, at their sole and 
 voluntary option, disclose information in their possession regarding their claim, their compensation and 
 their experience with the Program. 
 All confidentiality requirements are subject to law, regulation and judicial process. 
 The Administrator may, on a periodic basis, publish reports regarding the Program's claims processing or 
 other activities in an effort to provide transparency. Such reports will report on an aggregate level only. 
 No individual Claimant information will be published or disclosed in a way that compromises Claimant 
 confidentiality.

 Okay M, I know the issue. The TDY needs to be changed to Santa Monica, CA instead of Los Angeles, CA since you're 
 actually staying in a hotel that's in Santa Monica, CA, which has a per diem of $248. Los Angeles, CA has a per diem of 
 $181 only. I'll make the amendments and resend your Travel Authorization to Budget ASAP.

 respectively, some combination of the 13th to the 15th (and no conference room necessary for this trip). 
 thanks,

 Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request 
 permission to travel next week for an interview in West Palm Beach on November 4. It will just be me and and 
 we'll travel some combination of the 3rd to the 5th. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
 conference room at the hotel on that Monday for the interview, please. 
 thanks very much,

 Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next 
 week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later 
 than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, M, 
 EFTA00030449
and/or as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at 
 the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

 Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
 three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
 down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
 Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
 be me and or and but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
 super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
 conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. 
 thanks very much,

 Hi 
 We understand you had been planning to make the Noel/Thomas FOIA disclosure on Friday. We just ran this by =, 
 and she'd like you to ask for a brief (1-2 week) extension to enable us to confer internally regarding the interviews, which 
 were just completed, to confirm we agree they've fulfilled that requirement of their deferred prosecution agreements. 
 She's going to speak with . about it as well. Is this doable?

 Here are a few more things from your request. I have been unable to locate any watch calls or SROs from the requested 
 time frame. I will continue to look for those documents. I have been told SROs were likely not completed during that time 
 and also that most of the Control Center paperwork (originals), to include watch call sheets, were seized by the FBI and/or 
 OIG shortly after the incident, and therefore are no longer in the institution. 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

 —Thanks again for your help on this a few weeks ago. We've since had a number of productive conversations with

 the purpose of ascertaining what hard-copy materials they still have related to the case down there and how we could

 MI— Hope all is well. We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential 
 document/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were 
 largely at mooted at the time by Epstein's death, but as I'm sure you know, we've recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, 
 anticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week 
 for a quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you.

 Subject: Questions re Maxwell 
 I just got a call froa and we discussed a number of issues regarding Maxwell. The two issues I wanted to follow up 
 with you about are below: 
 • Maxwell is reporting that a staff member named o. was part of the group that included a 
 COVID positive individual but-is still working at the MDC. Would you please check on that for 
 me? 
 • Maxwell reported that a staff member entered her cell while she was inside it and took photographs of her cell 
 today. Anything you can share with me about the purpose of that? 
 More generall indicated that she believes Maxwell's mental health is deteriorating significantly because of the 
 constant survei ance she is experiencing. She reports being awoken in the night by a light shining into her eyes multiple 
 times a night, being searched more frequently than other inmates, and having a camera constantly pointed at her in a way 
 that other inmates do not experience. Our office of course defers to BOP on decisions regarding what is necessary for 
 safety and security, but I wanted to pass along the concern.

 All, 
 I hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I 
 continue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me 
 know if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. 
 Many of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. 
 These issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I tried to include all policies that 
 reference those topics. 
 1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? 
 Executive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will 
 address this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. 
 2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive 
 to? Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and 
 this section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. 
 3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
 This policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I included the 
 policy because it directly correlated with other requests. 
 4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive 
 to? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you 
 requested. It is dated 1/2/2014. I have requested an updated version that would have been used 
 more closely to the time of assignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to 
 provide me whatever it is they used at that time. 
 5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our 
 requests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request 
 EFTA00030500
one from a time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the 
 Institutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It 
 is now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. 
 6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this 
 responsive to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of 
 quarterly SHU training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online 
 training platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The 
 official SHU training course is not something I can send or save due to the nature of the course 
 being automated by the training platform and not a hard file. 
 7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the 
 Standards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've 
 attached the DO] Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let 
 me know. 
 8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these 
 logs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I have worked at 
 places that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. 
 The LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for 
 review purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. 
 9. We were provided with a document called "SHU Logs MW" and a document called "SHU Logs." Can we confirm 
 what these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the 
 digital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time 
 period. I am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control 
 Center at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch 
 calls into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a — 6p each day. 
 10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as 
 having been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly 
 training requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. 
 11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request 
 incorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. 
 12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I am not aware of any such policy and 
 have struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I will continue to search 
 for a policy that references cellmate assignments. 
 13. In the second email, there is a document called "Hot Lists" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this 
 responsive to? The "Hot List" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires 
 immediate notification to Psychology. This is the only "high risk" list the BOP has and I provided it 
 in response to you.uest for "All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings..." 
 14. In the second email, mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. 
 Do you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? 
 15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I continue to work from home, I have not 
 personally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I previously mentioned, 
 those logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I continue to follow up on this. 
 With regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are 
 currently in SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming 
 they were completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I am currently 
 trying to figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs 
 for the period of assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking 
 down inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number 
 of institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time 
 that are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with 
 all of the other documentation shortly after his death, but I have not confirmed that yet.

 I know this is a sensitive subject with the team, but do you think we have enough in the indictment to support the 
 interstate travel component necessary to both sets of charges? We certainly allege that the victims were abused in 
 multiple states which give rise to an inference of travel, but in terms of the enticing/causing to travel, this is about all we 
 have: 
 GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor 
 victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew 
 and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
 That is probably sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, but do you think it is worth pushing the team to try to add 
 more?

 Do you want to review those? Or should they go straight to Audrey? I confess, most of the ones we have done historically 
 have been MC related, so they went straight to Audrey, but this one is on Epstein, so if you'd like to see first, let me know.

 Thanks for letting us know about the possible meeting location change— please let us know once you've been able to

 Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court 
 security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the 
 conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

 Subject: SF SUN SENTINEL: Some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new charges in South Florida

 Some ofJeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new 
 charges in South Florida 
 Is‘ Marc Freeman 
 mil. III FLORIDA SUN SL: I INLL 
 JUL 30. 2019 12:34 PM 
 After the recent arrest of financier Jeffrey Epstein in New York on federal sex trafficking charges, a number 
 of his victims want more. They want him to be prosecuted in South Florida as well. 
 But according to federal prosecutors, some of the minor girls he abused at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 
 do not want to see him face new criminal counts here. And those government lawyers say they fully support that 
 position. 
 Advertisement 
 The debate about prosecuting Epstein in South Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West 
 Palm Beach is considering whether to strike down parts of Epstein's controversial 2007 deal that gave him and 
 unnamed co-conspirators immunity from federal charges. 
 U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement 
 violated the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark 
 about it until after it had been finalized. 
 Marra ust decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for 
 two of Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. 
 The victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are 
 long overdue charges in Florida. 
 EFTA00030511
"To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New 
 York," their lawyers wrote. "But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's crimes 
 in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large." 
 Attorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's 
 Office in April. 
 "She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail," Kuvin said. "She said, `I don't know if that's a 
 realistic possibility, but that's what I want.'" 
 He said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. 
 "When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be 
 handled," Kuvin said. "But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come 
 forward ... is enough to put him away." 
 The federal prosecutors explained that while some victims "would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, 
 they valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in 
 any criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or the 
 public." 
 This is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, 
 wrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. 
 Kitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. 
 [Popular on SunSentinel.com]  Batter up: Here's the 2020 South Florida Fair's theme » 
 But they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still "exacerbates the harm to 
 victims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim." 
 Kuvin said he agrees, "It's a valid concern for some of the victims." 
 Attorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's reasoning 
 to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. 
 Lawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to 
 prosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. 
 The lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the 
 prosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. 
 "The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no 
 credence from the Court," wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane Doe 
 I and Jane Doe 2.

 EFTA00030512
They also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged "risk" to some victims outweighs 
 obtaining justice for their clients. 
 "But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous," they wrote this 
 month. 
 Epstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal 
 shouldn't be blown up to allow new charges.

 Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
 reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
 please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for

 I have another search request for the Maxwell case, please. If there's any way to get these searches run before you're off 
 tomorrow, I'd be very grateful. 
 We need the following search terms run on all of the non-privileged files contained in the three folders entitled 
 "NYC024328", "NYC024349", and "NYC024350" in the "US v Epstein (SW Returns)" database on Relativity: 
 • Please run the search terms listed in the attached Word document entitled "Epstein Responsiveness Search Terms". 
 Please tag all hits with a tag entitled "Potentially Responsive". I believe you modified these search terms when 
 running them on a larger data set in the same database. Please feel free to use those modified terms on this 
 search as well if that is easier. 
 • For all of the email addresses listed in the attached Word document entitled "Epstein Responsiveness Email 
 Addresses," please pull any email with any of those addresses in the header (TO, FROM, CC, or 8CC). Please tag all 
 of those emails with the same tag entitled "Potentially Responsive". 
 Please let me know when these searches are complete, so that I can review the Potentially Responsive hits. Once we have 
 reviewed, we will let you know what should be produced from that database.

 Hi 
 I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
 would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
 review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
 did something similar in the Avenatti case, and I= like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
 huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
 Thanks so much—

 If you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced in these materials, including 
 items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we will make arrangements for you to 
 do so. 
 The defendant also made oral statements when he was arrested on or about July 6, 2019. 
 Notes memorializing those statements are included in this production and are marked with control 
 number USAO 002273. 
 The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
 and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This 
 disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information 
 constitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. 
 Specifically, the Government discloses the following: 
 • The victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-1" received a grand jury subpoena 
 from the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") in or about 2008. However, Victim-1 
 was never interviewed by law enforcement, including the West Palm Beach Police 
 Department, Federal Bureau of investigation ("FBI"), or SDFL in connection with their 
 investigation, and Victim-1 did not testify before the grand jury in SDFL. Victim-1 was 
 first interviewed by law enforcement regarding the defendant in or about 2019, after FBI 
 agents from the New York Field Office working with this Office approached Victim-1. 
 The victims identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" and "Victim-3" were both 
 interviewed by law enforcement in connection with the SDFL investigation on multiple 
 occasions between in or around 2006 and in or around 2008. Victim-2 and Vicitm-3 
 were both identified as victims in the July 10, 2008 letter from SDFL to counsel for the 
 defendant. Victim-1 was not included on that list. Please note that all three of these 
 victims are currently represented by counsel. 
 • During an interview with FBI agents in West Palm Beach, Florida in or around 2007, the 
 victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" stated that during her first contact with 
 the defendant, she told the defendant that she had just turned eighteen, when in fact she 
 was younger than eighteen at the time. In subsequent interviews, Victim-2 has told law 
 enforcement that the first time she met the defendant, she told him that she was 16, when 
 in fact she was younger than sixteen. Victim-2 further stated that she brought other 
 victims to the defendant's residence for sexualized massages. She initially told these 
 victims that they should tell the defendant that they were older than they in fact were. 
 Over time, however, Victim-2 stopped telling other victims this because she came to 
 understand that the defendant had a specific preference for underage girls. 
 • During the Palm Beach Police Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a 
 witness ("Witness-1") disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to 
 bring girls for sexualized massages, and that the defendant told her: "the younger the 
 better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who were under the age of eighteen 
 to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl who was over 
 eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 
 06.20.2018 
 EFTA00030534
Page 4 
 remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." 
 Please note that Witness-1 is also represented by counsel, Rita Glavin, 
 The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 
 (1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule agreed 
 upon by the parties or set by the Court. 
 Disclosure by the Defendant 
 In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests 
 reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
 inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
 defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
 evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
 examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
 thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
 introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
 defendant intends to call at trial. 
 The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
 will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
 request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
 defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
 Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
 This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines 
 available for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations 
 pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks 
 prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions 
 remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court 
 six weeks in advance of the trial. 
 06.20.2018 
 EFTA00030535
Page 5 
 Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of this Office concerning plea offers, 
 no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
 of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
 reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
 constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 
 1376 (2012); Missouri v. Fiye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012).

 Hi =, 
 (USANYS) 
 Hope you're doing well. Are you able to send us a report tomorrow summarizing the search terms you ran for the 
 responsiveness review in the Epstein search warrant database? We want to see which terms are pulling in the highest 
 volume of documents. 
 If at all possible, we'd really appreciate this tomorrow morning, as we're on a tight turnaround for finalizing our review. 
 Thanks so much—

 In response to your request for any statements made by Mr. Tartaglione during interviews at the MCC related to the 
 investigation into an event involving Jeffrey Epstein on or about July 23, 2019, we are producing to you a zip folder 
 with reports of those statements. The zip folder also contains reports of statements attributed to Mr. Tartaglione 
 that were conveyed to MCC staff by Mr. Epstein. These materials have been marked "sensitive" pursuant to the 
 protective order in this case and should be treated accordingly. 
 In response to your additional request for "all the reports and video regarding Mr. Epstein's attempted suicide on July 
 22 -23 rd ," we do not believe these materials are relevant to this case or covered under Rule 16, and therefore will not 
 be producing them. If you would like to discuss further, please give us a call.

 July 22nd or the early hours of July 23, 2019 concerning Jeffrey Epstein's reported attempted suicide attempt.

 Hi all! 
 Great news — after I've reviewed, the drive going to defense today has all the required items for production! I believe we 
 will be uploading NYC024318 1871 (iPhone) to this drive (and I've noted the tentative bates number for that on the index, 
 attached here and updated on the shared, and in the cover letter, attached) — but other than that, we are all set. 
 I've attached a (very basic) cover letter for defense, for your review and relevant additions. Since we are reproducing so 
 much to MDC, I also created a unique index for the MDC drive on the shared index. I can attach that chart to defense's 
 cover letter when it goes out, if that would be helpful, or I can just keep the MDC index section for our internal 
 organization. 
 is still working on copying the MDC drive. Hopefully we'll have an update soon. I'm happy to make any changes 
 within the cover letter and/or index as necessary. Thank you all!

 We are continuing to review the requests in your letter, and we intend to provide you with a written response to those 
 requests as soon as we are able. We note, though, that your letter makes dozens of broad requests — including at least 
 one request that Judge Nathan has already denied. As a result, although we fully intend to respond in sufficient time to 
 permit you to make any motion you deem appropriate in December consistent with the Court's schedule, we do not 
 anticipate being able to do so on or before October 21, 2020.

 A concernedMthat would like to see the evidence in Epstein case be made public. He asked a lot of questions wants 
 to know who is getting indicted next and said if they are high profile people like the news is reporting are you going to do 
 anything about it. Really pushy wants to know what evidence we have against people and when we are going to indict 
 some of these people. Wants to know what was in the safe. (Really)

 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 We write in response to your letter of October 13, 2020 setting forth "requests for 
 discovery, inspection, and copying, in accordance with the guarantees of the Fourth, Fifth, and 
 Sixth Amendments, Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of 
 Evidence, and such other laws and rules as may be applicable." The letter lists 22 specific requests 
 (the "Requests"). The letter also makes a general request for materials pursuant to Brady v. 
 Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), followed by 10 "specific 
 Brady requests." 
 As an initial matter, we take seriously our disclosure obligations, including those arising 
 under Rule 16, Brady and its progeny, and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) and its 
 progeny, and we intend to comply fully with those obligations. We intend to do so irrespective of 
 whether you specifically request such material, or how you characterize that material. Indeed, as 
 you are aware, we have already made substantial productions pursuant to Rule 16 and otherwise 
 in this case. The Government will continue to fulfill all of its obligations going forward. 
 However, your unilateral assertion that particular items constitute "Brady materials" does 
 not itself render those materials subject to disclosure, let alone immediate disclosure some nine 
 months before trial. To the contrary, a substantial amount of the materials sought in the Requests 
 are plainly material to which you are entitled, if at all, solely pursuant to Title 18, United States 
 EFTA00030569
Code, Section 3500 (hereinafter "3500 material") or Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 105 (1972) 
 and its progeny (hereinafter "Giglio material"). As you are aware, it is the standard practice in this 
 District that such material is produced shortly in advance of trial, a practice that has been widely 
 held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement that Giglio be produced "in sufficient time that the 
 defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon the information efficaciously." United 
 States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2007). Immediate disclosure of such material is 
 not warranted simply because the defendant prefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, 15 Cr. 611 
 (AJN), 2017 WL 237651, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2017) (denying defendant's motion for 
 immediate disclosure of Giglio material as defendant "fails to articulate any persuasive reason why 
 immediate disclosure is required in this case, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so 
 substantially from the typical practice"); United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 
 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013) (denying request for early production of Jencks Act 
 material); United States v. Hernandez, No. 09 Cr. 625 (HB), 2010 WL 26544, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 
 6, 2010) (declining to order immediate disclosure of Giglio material, because the Government 
 stated it would provide both Giglio and Jencks Act material "shortly before trial"); United States 
 v. Davis, No. 06 Cr. 911 (LBS), 2009 WL 637164, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. March 11, 2009) ("The Second 
 Circuit has held that a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis 
 in the law."). 
 Consistent with that well-established practice, we intend to begin producing any 3500 and 
 Giglio material substantially closer to trial. As we have indicated in prior letters to you and the 
 Court, the Government is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for 
 witnesses it expects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the 
 Government is prepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at 
 trial as early as eight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals' privacy 
 to be negotiated by the parties. We note that, to date, the parties have not engaged in any 
 discussions about a schedule for pretrial disclosures, but we are prepared to discuss such a schedule 
 at your convenience. 
 In return, we reiterate our request that the defendant disclose prior statements of any 
 witnesses she will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 
 (1975). We request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to 
 supply the defendant with such material relating to Government witnesses, and we are amenable 
 to discussing a schedule for all parties' pretrial disclosures. We also reiterate our request for 
 reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). 
 With respect to your remaining requests, we endeavor to respond directly to those below. 
 By voluntarily providing this information, the Government is not limiting its evidence, arguments, 
 or legal theories at trial in any way. If you have any questions or would like to confer further, 
 please let us know and we will be happy to arrange a call or meeting to confer further at a mutually 
 convenient time. 
 Request 1— Any Oral, Written, or Recorded Statements Made by the Defendant: As 
 noted in your request, the Government has produced statements made by the defendant in prior 
 civil proceedings, as well as statements made at the time of her arrest. The Government is not 
 aware of any other statements the defendant has made to law enforcement. 
 2 
 EFTA00030570
Request 2 — Statements of Alleged Co-Conspirators: To the extent that your request 
 seeks disclosure and identification of any statements of alleged co-conspirators that the 
 Government intends to introduce at trial, this request is premature and without legal basis. To the 
 extent the materials the defendant seeks may fall within the Jencks Act, the Jencks Act provides 
 that "[i]n any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the 
 possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective 
 Government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of subpoena, discovery, or 
 inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case." 18 U.S.C. 
 § 3500(a). In addition, Rule 16 exempts from production, prior to trial, the materials the defendant 
 seeks: "[T]his rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other 
 internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent 
 in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case. Nor does this rule authorize the discovery 
 or inspection of statements made by prospective government witnesses except as provided in 18 
 U.S.C. § 3500." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2). In light of these provisions, requests for discovery of 
 Jencks Act materials in advance of trial are uniformly denied in this District. Indeed, there is no 
 legal basis to order the disclosure of statements of Government witnesses before their direct 
 testimony at trial. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. 1987) (issuing a writ of mandamus 
 reversing District Court's order directing the Government "to produce all oral statement made by 
 the defendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a 
 defendant" under Fed. R. Evid. 801); United States ex rel. Lucas v. Regan, 503 F.2d 1, 3 n.I (2d 
 Cir. 1974); United States v. Sebastian, 497 F.2d 1267, 1268-69 (2d Cir. 1974); United States v. 
 Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 1974). 
 Further, disclosure of any statements of alleged co-conspirators would necessitate the 
 identification of co-conspirators. You identify no authority for the proposition that the 
 Government is required to identify all known co-conspirators in connection with the charged 
 conspiracy that the Government may seek to prove at trial, and to the contrary, courts in this district 
 routinely deny similar requests. See, e.g., United States v. Castro, No. 08 Cr. 268 (NRB), 2008 
 WL 5062724, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008) ("An indictment need not identify all alleged co-
 conspirators, nor specify the nature, time and place of every overt act the defendant or others 
 allegedly took in furtherance of a conspiracy, nor must it set forth all the evidence the government 
 intends to introduce."); United States v. Trippe, 171 F. Supp. 2d 230, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) 
 ("[D]emands for particular information with respect to where, when, and with whom the 
 Government will charge the defendant with conspiring are routinely denied."); United States v. 
 Fruchter, 104 F. Supp. 2d 289, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying "Defendants' request for names of 
 all alders, abettors, unindicted co-conspirators, and confidential informants" as "nothing more than 
 a request for a witness list"). 
 That said, as previously stated, we intend to produce all Jencks Act and Giglio material in 
 advance of trial and remain available to confer generally regarding a mutual schedule for pretrial 
 and trial-related disclosures, including witness statements or Giglio material. 
 Request 3 — Prior Criminal Records of the Defendant: The Government is not aware 
 of any prior convictions or arrests of the defendant. 
 3 
 EFTA00030571
Request 4 — Any Books, Papers, Documents, Data, Photographs, Tangible Objects, 
 Buildings, or Places, or Copies or Portions of Any of These Items: The Government did not 
 seize any documents or tangible items from the defendant, including through a search warrant. As 
 you are aware from discovery, the Government has obtained a number of tangible items during its 
 investigation through various means, including search warrants executed at properties of Jeffrey 
 Epstein. We have already produced copies of many of those items in discovery, and, as we 
 previously advised in August 2020, if you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced 
 in the produced materials, including items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we 
 will make arrangements for you to do so. 
 Request 5 — Results or Reports of Any Physical or Mental Examination and of Any 
 Scientific Test or Experiment: The Government is unaware of any physical or mental 
 examination or scientific tests or experiments to which you are entitled. The Government is 
 continuing to review files and will produce such materials to which you are entitled at the 
 appropriate time. 
 Request 6 — A Written Summary of Any Testimony the Government Intends to 
 Introduce at trial under Federal Rules of Evidence 702, 703, or 705: To the extent the 
 Government intends to call any expert to testify at trial, the Government will provide appropriate 
 notice reasonably before trial, as is the standard practice in this District. The Government is 
 prepared to engage in good faith discussions with you about a mutual schedule for pretrial and 
 trial -related disclosures, including expert notice. 
 Request 7 — The Identities of Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3 
 (the "Minor Victims"): Such disclosure would be entirely premature nine months before trial. 
 Indeed, in August, after the defendant sought an order directing the Government to disclose to 
 defense counsel the identifies of the Minor Victims, Judge Nathan ruled that the request was 
 premature, noting that production of discovery had just begun and the "parties have not yet 
 engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures, including 
 witness lists and § 3500 material." (Dkt. 49 at 1). Judge Nathan ordered that the parties "meet 
 and confer on an appropriate schedule" "[fjollowing the close of discovery." (Id. at 2). The 
 deadline for the production of Rule 16 discovery set by the Court is November 9, 2020. (Dkt. 25). 
 The Government is prepared to engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an 
 appropriate schedule for disclosure of 3500 material. 
 Request 8 — The Complete Birthdays of the Minor Victims: In our discovery transmittal 
 letter dated August 13, 2020, the Government included the months and years of birth for each of 
 the Minor Victims so as to enable the defendant to evaluate whether she will make any motions or 
 legal arguments relating to the ages of the victims. You have not identified why you need 
 additional information regarding each of the Minor Victims at this time, the relevance of such 
 information to this case, or the basis under which such information would be subject to disclosure 
 or discovery at this time. Such information will be included in 3500 material for the Minor Victims 
 which will be produced reasonably in advance of trial. 
 Request 9 — All Written and Oral Communications Concerning the Negotiations 
 Relating to the Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") Signed by Epstein on September 24, 
 4 
 EFTA00030572
2007: Your request does not articulate a basis in law for your assertion that you are entitled to the 
 materials listed in Request 9—including communications between various Government and law 
 enforcement entities and Epstein's attorneys and communications between and among "any 
 government employees"—or that such materials fall within the scope of Rule 16 or any other 
 disclosure obligation. Nor is the Government aware of any basis in law for this request. We note, 
 in this respect, that neither the defendant nor the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
 of New York is a party or signatory to the NPA, nor is the defendant or this Office named therein. 
 As noted in the Government's letter of October 7, 2020 (Dkt. 63), although the Government 
 does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails sent or received by attorneys at 
 the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("USAO-SDFL") as part 
 of its separate, prior investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, as set forth in greater detail 
 in that letter, the Government intends to gather certain martials from USAO-SDFL and conduct 
 targeted searches of that material aimed at identifying potential Giglio or 3500 material for victims 
 or witnesses relevant to this prosecution. See Dkt. 63 at 7. To the extent that review reveals such 
 material, it will be produced at the appropriate stage in the litigation and according to any schedule 
 set for pre-trial disclosures. 
 Request 10 — A Complete Copy of the Diary: The Government has produced all pages 
 of the diary in the Government's possession. The Government has never reviewed or possessed 
 any other portions of the diary. To the extent this request calls for information that is not currently 
 in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis 
 or authority for this request, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or 
 disclose this information. 
 Request 11 — A Complete, Unredacted Copy of FBI 302 Bearing Bates Numbers 
 SDNY_GM_00114982-00114993: The Government has produced this particular version of the 
 document in the form in which it received the document in response to a subpoena, which included 
 redactions. To the extent the Government separately has access to an unredacted version of the 
 same FBI 302, the Government will produce that unredacted version, as well as all other statements 
 and impeachment material for witnesses, at the appropriate time, as discussed herein. 
 Request 12 — All Versions and Drafts of "The Billionaires Playboy Club": The 
 Government has produced all versions of "The Billionaires Playboy Club" in the Government's 
 possession of which we are currently aware. The Government has produced these materials in the 
 form in which it received those materials in response to a subpoena. To the extent this request 
 calls for information that is not currently in the Government's possession or which is not subject 
 to disclosure, you identify no legal basis or authority for this request, and we are not aware of any 
 authority requiring us to obtain and/or disclose this information. 
 Request 13 — Documents and Materials Related to the Minor Victims: As to your 
 requests for documents and materials under Requests 13(a) through (f), the Government has 
 produced any such materials relating to the Minor Victims listed in the Indictment that are in the 
 Government's possession and that fall within the scope of Rule 16. As noted in the Government's 
 October 7, 2020 letter (Dkt. 63), the Government is continuing to review files created and 
 maintained by other offices for material that may be responsive to these requests and will produce 
 5 
 EFTA00030573
any material identified through that review as appropriate. Additionally, as you know, the 
 Government is preparing a production of responsive materials from electronic devices seized 
 during searches of Epstein's New York and Virgin Island residences. To the extent the 
 Government identifies any additional materials that it intends to introduce at trial, the Government 
 will promptly produce such materials. 
 With regard to your many requests for material that might fall within the scope of the 
 Government's Giglio obligations, as you know and as set forth above, the uniform practice in this 
 District, which the Government intends to follow, is to produce Giglio and Jencks Act materials 
 simultaneously and shortly before trial. As noted above, this practice has been widely held to be 
 sufficient to satisfy the requirement that Giglio be produced "in sufficient time that the defendant 
 will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon the information efficaciously." Rodriguez, 496 
 F.3d at 226. Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant 
 prefers it. See, e.g., Hernandez, 2010 WL 26544, at *6; Davis, 2009 WL 637164, at *14. As noted 
 above, the Government is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for 
 witnesses it expects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial, and statements for witnesses 
 who it does not expect to call at trial as early as eight weeks prior to trial. 
 The Government notes that, in response to your request for any submissions to the Epstein 
 Victims' Compensation Program made by the Minor Victims or any other witness who has alleged 
 that the defendant engaged in or facilitated improper sexual conduct at any time, the Government 
 plays no role in administering that program. As such, the Government is not in possession of any 
 submissions to this program. To the extent this request calls for information that is not currently 
 in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis 
 or authority for this request, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or 
 disclose this information. 
 You have also requested under Request 13(i) "[a]ll communications between or among 
 [the Minor Victims or other witnesses who allege that the defendant engaged in or facilitated 
 improper sexual conduct], or between these individuals and counsel for any other such individual, 
 including but not limited to, emails, text messages, social media posts, and other correspondence." 
 The Government does not understand the basis for this request, and you identify none. To the 
 extent this request calls for materials that are not currently in the Government's possession or 
 which are not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis or authority for this request, and we 
 are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or disclose this information. 
 As to your request for "public statements made by these individuals concerning" Epstein 
 or the defendant, the Government is unaware of any authority that such material falls within the 
 scope of Rule 16 or that the Government is otherwise required to collect and provide materials that 
 are publicly available. 
 As to your request for records or reports of any physical, medical, mental, or psychological 
 examinations of these individuals, to the extent any such materials exist and are in the 
 Government's possession, they will be produced as part of the Government's production of Jencks 
 Act and Giglio material at the appropriate stage in the litigation. 
 6 
 EFTA00030574
As to your request for all "written and oral communications between the government and 
 the attorneys for those individuals [certain victims]," the Government is unaware of any authority 
 that entitles you to these materials. To the extent such materials constitute Giglio or Jencks Act 
 materials, the Government will produce such materials at the appropriate time. Your request does 
 not articulate a basis in law for your assertion that you are entitled to such material at this time, or 
 that you are entitled to any such communications that do not constitute Giglio or Jencks Act 
 material. 
 Request 14 — All Written and Oral Communications and Other Documents 
 Concerning Meetings between the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
 of New York and Specified Attorneys for the Minor Victims and Other Witnesses: Your 
 request does not articulate a basis in law for your assertion that you are entitled to such material. 
 The Government is unaware of any authority that entitles you to these materials. 
 Request 15 — Complete FBI Case File Regarding the Investigation of 
 for Obstruction of Justice: As noted in our discovery transmittal letter dated August 
 21, 2020, this file has no relation to your client and has no bearing on the charges in this case. The 
 Government is not aware of the relevance of such records to the conduct at issue in this case, and 
 you have not identified the relevance of such records, although we are willing to discuss the basis 
 for any such request at your convenience. 
 Request 16 — Copies of the Prosecution Memo and Indictment Drafted as Part of the 
 United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL"): The 
 Government is unaware of any authority that entitles you to the documents that you seek under 
 this request. To the contrary, Rule 16 exempts from disclosure "internal government documents 
 made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with 
 investigating or prosecuting the case." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(F)(2); see also United States v. 
 Annstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463 (1996) ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine 
 Government work product in connection with his case."); United States v. Ghailani, 687 F. Supp. 
 2d 365, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (concluding that an internal government memorandum fell within 
 Rule 16(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and was therefore "protected against 
 disclosure regardless of its materiality."). 
 Request 17 — E-mails, Text Messages, Letters, or Other Written Communications To 
 or From the Defendant: To the extent the Government identifies material that is discoverable 
 under Rule 16 and responsive to this request, the Government will promptly produce such 
 materials. In particular, the Government has seized and worked to extract data from approximately 
 62 electronic devices in connection with search warrants executed at Epstein's properties. As 
 noted in the Government's discovery transmittal letter dated October 20, 2020, we anticipate 
 producing only the materials designated responsive to the terms of the search warrants. The 
 Government has directed its vendor to download these materials from the electronic database on 
 which they are stored and to have those materials ready for production to you by November 9, 
 2020. 
 Request 18 — Medical Records or Reports Concerning Epstein: The Government is not 
 aware of the relevance of such records to the conduct at issue in this case, and you have not 
 7 
 EFTA00030575
identified the relevance of such records. The Government is unaware of any authority that entitles 
 you to these materials, and you provide none. 
 Request 19 — Subpoenas and Voluntary Requests for Production of Documents Issued 
 in Connection with or Related to this Case, and All Evidence Obtained By Subpoena or 
 Voluntary Production: The Government is unaware of any authority that entitles you to the 
 grand jury subpoenas and voluntary requests for documents that you seek under this request, and 
 you provide none. To the extent you seek evidence obtained by the Government "by subpoena or 
 from voluntary production (to the extent it has not already been produced)," the Government has 
 produced all subpoena returns that fall within the scope of Rule 16 that the Government has 
 received through the date of the indictment. The Government has also endeavored to make clear 
 in its productions which materials were obtained pursuant to subpoena. To the extent the 
 Government identifies or receives additional subpoena returns, the Government will promptly turn 
 over materials that fall within the scope of Rule 16. To the extent such subpoena returns contain 
 Giglio material or 3500 material, the Government will produce that material at the appropriate 
 time as agreed to by the parties and the Court. Similarly, the Government has produced and will 
 continue to produce materials obtained by voluntary production to the extent such materials fall 
 within Rule 16. To the extent such materials contain Giglio material or 3500 material, the 
 Government will produce such materials closer to trial on the agreed upon schedule. 
 Request 20 — Evidence the Government Intends to Introduce Pursuant to Federal 
 Rule of Evidence 404(b) or as Background of the Conspiracies: With respect to any evidence 
 the Government may seek to offer pursuant to Rule 404(b), as you are aware, Rule 404 requires 
 only that "reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence" be provided sometime 
 "before trial." Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2)(A)-(B). In this Circuit, that provision typically is construed 
 to require notice several weeks before trial. See United States v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337, 345 
 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (in the "'absence of any threat to the safety of prospective witnesses and the .. . 
 Rule 404(b) evidence [is important to] th[e] action,"' courts in this District have generally found 
 that disclosures made approximately 30 to 45 days prior to trial constitute "reasonable notice" to 
 defendants) (quoting United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 577 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); Giffen, 
 379 F. Supp. 2d at 344 (Rule 404 does not obligate the Government to provide "unduly early 
 notice" because "early disclosure presents a significant burden on preparation of the Government's 
 case."). 
 Here, and consistent with the requirements of Rule 404, the Government intends to identify 
 such evidence and provide notice substantially closer to trial. As noted throughout, the 
 Government is amenable to a discussion about a joint schedule for pretrial disclosures, including 
 404(b) notice, at your convenience. 
 Requests 21 and 22 — Information about the Grand Jury that Indicted this Case: A 
 grand jury sitting in White Plains, New York that was empaneled in November 2019 returned 
 Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) and Superseding Indictment S 120 Cr. 330 (AJN). No grand jurors 
 participated remotely in any session relevant to this case. To the extent your request seeks "a list 
 of grand jurors, their attendance dates, [or] the reasons for any absence," as well as information on 
 persons present during grand jury proceedings, the Government is not aware of any authority that 
 entitles you to the information you seek under these requests. Grand jury proceedings are not 
 8 
 EFTA00030576
governed by Rule 16 and therefore are not discoverable. Disclosure of information related to grand 
 jury proceedings is not authorized by Rule 16 and is permitted only when "ordered upon a showing 
 of particularized need." See United States v. Sells Engineering, 463 U.S. 418, 443 (1983) ("[w]e 
 have consistently construed [Rule 6(e)] . .. to require a strong showing of particularized need for 
 grand jury materials before any disclosure will be permitted"); see also Dennis v. United States, 
 384 U.S. 855, 869-870 (1966). This is because grand jury proceedings are afforded a "presumption 
 of regularity" that may be dispelled only by particularized proof of irregularities in the grand jury 
 process. United States v. Leung, 40 F.3d 577, 581 (2d Cir. 1994). 
 "[SI pecific Brady requests": The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady and 
 its progeny and will provide timely disclosure if and when such material comes to light. With 
 respect to your requests under the section titled "Exculpatory Evidence," the Government is not 
 aware of any evidence suggesting that Maxwell was not involved in or aware of the conduct alleged 
 in the Indictment. The Government will provide timely disclosure if it learns of any such material. 
 Certain of your requests suggest your view that any evidence that Epstein sexually abused or 
 assaulted a victim, but without the knowledge or participation of the defendant, is somehow 
 exculpatory. We note that your request is neither limited in time to the period charged in the 
 Indictment nor limited to victims who claim to have been minors at the time of their abuse. You 
 identify no basis in law for such a broad request, nor is the Government aware of one. Your request 
 fails to explain how, for example, evidence that a witness alleges that she was sexually abused by 
 Epstein, "with or without the involvement" of the defendant, but who was not a minor at the time 
 of the alleged sexual abuse, or who claims to have been abused years after the conduct charged in 
 the Indictment, is somehow exculpatory. As noted in the Government's letter of October 20, 2020, 
 the well-established law of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence 
 that a defendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of their law-
 abiding conduct during uncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government's 
 evidence with respect to the charged crimes or events. Dkt. 65; see, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 
 897 F.2d 63, 70 (2d Cir. 1990) ("A defendant may not seek to establish his innocence . . . through 
 proof of the absence of criminal acts on [other] specific occasions."). To the extent that you wish 
 to provide us grounds or any authority as to why such information would be exculpatory, please 
 do so. 
 You also request evidence concerning witnesses who contacted the Government or law 
 enforcement about sexual abuse by Epstein or the defendant who were determined not to be 
 credible, as well as "negative" investigative efforts to verify information provided by any and all 
 witnesses. We are unaware of any authority requiring the production of such information. If you 
 would like to clarify your request, and the authority for it, we will consider it further. 
 Many of your additional specific requests for material appear to fall within Giglio and 
 Jencks Acts materials, rather than Brady, including, for example, the requests for impeachment 
 evidence, Giglio information, evidence of bias or motive to lie, contradictory statements of any 
 prospective government witness, and evidence of criminal investigations or misconduct of any 
 government witness. As described above, the Government intends to follow the uniform practice 
 in this District, and produce before trial Giglio and Jencks Act materials for witnesses it expects 
 to call at trial, as well as any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial. The 
 Government has noted a proposed schedule in this letter. We are amenable to discussing an

 Hey, 
 As discussed, attached is the revised memo incorporating comments with just the one final note to answer about

alternative schedule for mutual pretrial disclosures. We also reiterate our request that the 
 defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses she will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; 
 United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We request that such material be provided on the 
 same basis upon which we agree to supply the defendant with such material relating to Government 
 witnesses. 
 To the extent you are requesting that the Government produce items beyond its Brady and 
 Rule 16 obligations, the Government has no such obligation at this time. See Weatherford v. 
 Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977). As you know, in all federal criminal cases, it is Rule 16 that 
 principally governs pretrial discovery. Rule 16 is not "intended to provide the defendant with 
 access to the entirety of the government's case against him." See, e.g., Percevault, 490 F.2d at 
 130. Nor does Rule 16 "entitle a criminal defendant to a broad and blind fishing expedition among 
 items possessed by the Government on the chance that something impeaching might turn up." 
 United States v. Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 12, 
 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
 If there are any specific anticipated defenses that would bear upon the Government's 
 ongoing review for items that may be material to preparing the defense, you are welcome to outline 
 such defenses. 
 Conclusion 
 The Government remains available to confer further on any of the topics outlined above. 
 The Government also requests that the defendant confirm whether she has, to date, met her 
 reciprocal disclosure obligations under Rule 16(b) and we renew our request for reciprocal 
 disclosure from the defendant.

 Hi =,

 I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
 would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
 review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
 did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
 huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
 Thanks so much—

 I have finally got through to the sergeant at Wilton Manors and he does not have any records on me ever or Ron Eppinger or the guy 
 that I was picked up with supposedly named Charlie. It could be that they have destroyed the records being a minor or some other 
 legality that I am not aware of but I am in dire need of that information and have hit a road block. I know this is a long shot but is there 
 any way that you would know this information? 
 I can not express how sincerely apologetic I am to keep bothering you!! I am just hoping to finish what I have started and if I do... Trust

 Hi 
 Thank you for getting back to me on your day off! 
 I just remember when the tabloids sent their photographer out, they took note of the date on the back which was in 1997 and 
 possibly took a picture of it but as I do not want to contact the tabloids right now, I just need the evidence to ensure that is 
 correct. If you can, when you get back to the office, is there any chance you could have a look to see if there in fact a date 
 mentioned or photographed, it would be very helpful and I would be more than appreciative. 
 Have a nice day!!

 We will need to export the data from the database, but we will need to send a hard drive to the vendor as the file size of 
 the production will be too large to place on a FTP site for download. I would also suggest getting a hard drive from counsel 
 so you can copy the data on the hard drive. I can have the vendor start the export on Monday. Can you please see if you 
 can get a 1 TB drive to send to PAE so they can copy the production on the drive.

 Today, we spoke with SA one of the original FBI agents from the Florida investigation of Epstein. 
 told us he has a number of emails with AUSA regarding the case. Our view is that we do not need to 
 collect those emails from because we have already received thousands of emails, which were 
 collected by OPR and should encompass any emails with the FBI about the Epstein case. is going to send us 
 any emails he received from victims or witnesses. We also discussed other documents has in his possession 
 from the Epstein investigation and asked him to send us any that sounded potentially discoverable. 
 Please let us know if this approach sounds right to you or if you would like to discuss.

 Thanks very much for talking this morning. As discussed, attached is a draft application for an amended search warrant 
 correcting the FBI barcode numbers for 3 devices that were seized from Epstein's NY residence. In case it's useful, I'm also 
 attaching the exhibits that are referenced in the draft application. 
 Thanks,

 Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein 
 Dear Ms. Hutner: 
 By letter dated August 28, 2019, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern 
 District of New York ("USAO") requested that the OCME withhold from disclosure to any third 
 party (i) "any documents, evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or the 
 FBI —including documents, records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within 
 the OCME case file that include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the 
 USAO or FBI"; and (ii) "the names and identifying information of any federal law enforcement 
 agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the substance of any 
 statements or interviews made by those agents or employees" (the "August 28 Letter"). 
 At OCME's request, the USAO has made proposed redactions to the version of the OCME 
 report and file for Jeffrey Epstein that was previously provided by OCME to the FBI, consistent 
 with the requests set forth in the August 28 Letter. That redacted document is attached hereto. In 
 order to preserve the integrity of the ongoing investigation, in addition to the requests set forth in 
 the August 28 Letter, we also request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party this 
 letter and its attachment, and the August 28 Letter. We appreciate your willingness to comply 
 with these requests. Please contact us with any further questions. 
 Very truly yours,
